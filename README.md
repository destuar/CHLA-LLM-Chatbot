# CHLA-LLM-Capstone-Project

This repository contains the code and resources for the Infection & Prevention Control (IPC) Chatbot developed for Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). This chatbot provides instant access to CHLA's IPC policy documentation and references CDC guidance using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. 

## Project Overview

### The Problem
The current process for locating and retrieving IPC policies at CHLA is manual and labor-intensive. Staff members must navigate multiple sources to find relevant information, leading to inefficiencies and delays in accessing important guidance.

### Our Solution
We developed a Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot that delivers domain-specific content in a conversational format. The chatbot is designed to:
- Query and retrieve CHLA's policy documents and CDC guidance.
- Provide human-like responses with dynamic content retrieval.
- Keep internal content private while allowing growth over time.
- Be "plug-and-play" and agnostic, supporting the use of different pre-trained LLMs without costly retraining.

## Tech Stack

- **Google Custom Search API**: For referencing CDC content.
- **Ollama Model Wrapper**: LLM hosting infrastructure.
- **Llama 3.1 8B Model**: The core language model used.
- **Python**: Programming language for backend development.
- **Streamlit**: Frontend for user interaction.
- **LangChain**: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for optimized document search and retrieval.
- **Ubuntu 22.04**: The OS environment used for development and deployment.

## Folder Structure
