When the films have been opened, the contaminated wrappers will be discarded, and the lead foil portion disposed of in the appropriate container. The films can then be processed without contaminating darkroom equipment.

# General Principles

1. Rubber dams and high-speed evacuation, when appropriate, should be utilized to minimize generation of droplets and splatter.
2. Needles should be re-capped only by using the scoop method technique.

# Dental Unit Water Lines

1. Dental staff will follow the outlined procedures for the “Daily” and “Weekly” handling of dental water lines.
2. Weekly Procedure:
1. Every Thursday evening, or a day prior in the event of a clinic closure, dental unit water lines will undergo a chemical cleaning.
2. Each week, either chairs 1-6 or 7-11 including the cavitron units, will be taken out of use and cleaned. Those undergoing cleaning will be labeled as such and the remaining chairs used for emergencies that may take place overnight.
3. A rotating schedule will be observed and documented to assure compliance with the change in the available chair each week.
1. Procedure:
1. Remove all water from dental units and purge with air
2. Fill dental unit water container with approved cleaning solution and place a “caution” sign on dental units
3. Flush water lines until cleaning solution is emitted from each hose and outlet, leaving a small amount in the bottle.
4. Leave cleaning solution for specified time as per manufacturer’s instructions and turn dental units off.
5. All chairs with “caution” signs will be considered out of service during this cleaning period.
6. On the first day of the work week following this cleaning process, the dental water unit containers will be removed, thoroughly rinsed, filled with fresh sterile water, and reinstalled so that all dental unit water lines are thoroughly flushed until no visible residue is left in the lines.
7. Caution signs can then be removed, and the dental chairs considered “in service”.

2. Samples will be taken from each dental unit and sent to the Microbiology lab for testing.
3. Results will be communicated to the appropriate managers and Division Head as soon as they become available.
