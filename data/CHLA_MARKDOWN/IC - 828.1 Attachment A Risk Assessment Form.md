|Type of Construction Project Activity|Description|
|---|---|
|TYPE A|Inspection and Non-Invasive Activities. Includes, but is not limited to: - removal of ceiling tiles for visual inspection only, e.g., limited to 1 tile per 50 square feet

- wallcovering, electrical trim work, minor plumbing, and activities which do not generate dust or require cutting of walls or access to ceilings other than for visual inspection.
Small scale, short duration activities which create minimal dust|
|TYPE B|Includes, but is not limited to: - installation of telephone and computer cabling
- access to chase spaces
- cutting of walls or ceiling where dust migration can be controlled.
|
|TYPE C|Work that generates a moderate to high level of dust or requires demolition or removal of any fixed building components or assemblies Includes, but is not limited to: - sanding of walls for painting or wall covering
- removal of floorcoverings, ceiling tiles and casework
- new wall construction
- minor duct work or electrical work above ceilings
- major cabling activities
- any activity which cannot be completed within a single workshift.
|
|TYPE D|Major demolition and construction projects Includes, but is not limited to: - activities which require consecutive work shifts

|Low Risk|Medium Risk|High Risk|Highest Risk|
|---|---|---|---|
|Office areas|Medium Risk Outpatient Clinics (Refer to IC-828B)|High Risk Outpatient Clinics (Refer to IC-828B)|Highest Risk Outpatient Clinics (Refer to IC-828B)|
|Physical Therapy|Medical/Surgical Units|Intensive Care Units| |
|Radiology/Imaging|Pharmacy|ASC| |
|Laboratory|Post Anesthesia Care Unit|Sedation Unit| |
|Blood Donor Center| |Radiation Oncology| |
| | |Operating Rooms| |

Step Three: Match the Patient Risk Group (Low, Medium, High, Highest) with the planned Construction Project Type (A, B, C, D) on the following matrix, to find the Class of Precautions (I, II, III or IV) or level of infection control activities required. Class I-IV or Color-Coded Precautions are delineated on the following page.

| |Construction Project Type| | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Patient Risk Group|TYPE A|TYPE B|TYPE C|TYPE D|
|LOW Risk Group|II|II|III|III/IV|
|MEDIUM Risk Group|II|II|III|IV|
|HIGH Risk Group|II|II|III/IV|IV|
|HIGHEST Risk Group|II|III/IV|III/IV|IV|

Note: Infection Control approval will be required when the Construction Activity and Risk Level indicate that Class III or Class IV control procedures are necessary.
# CLASS I

Description of Required Infection Control Precautions by Class During Construction Project
1. Execute work by mepods to minimize raising dust from construction operations.
2. Immediately replace a ceiling tile displaced for visual inspection

# 1. Provide active means to prevent airborne dust from dispersing into atmosphere.

2. Water mist work surfaces to control dust while cutting.
3. Seal unused doors wip duct tape.
4. Block off and seal air vents.
5. Place dust mat at entrance and exit of work area
6. Isolate HVAC system in areas where work is being performed.

# CLASS II

1. Remove or Isolate HVAC system in area where work is being done to prevent contamination of duct system.
2. Complete all critical barriers i.e. sheetrock, plywood, plastic, to seal area from non work area or implement control cube mepod (cart wip plastic covering and sealed connection to work site wip HEPA vacuum for vacuuming prior to exit) before construction begins.
3. Maintain negative air pressure wipin work site utilizing HEPA equipped air filtration units or by oper means.
4. Contain construction waste before transport in tightly covered containers.
5. Cover transport receptacles or carts. Tape covering unless solid lid.

# CLASS III

1. Isolate HVAC system in area where work is being done to prevent contamination of duct system.
2. Complete all critical barriers i.e. sheetrock, plywood, plastic, to seal area from non work area or implement control cube mepod (cart wip plastic covering and sealed connection to work site wip HEPA vacuum for vacuuming prior to exit) before construction begins.
3. Maintain negative air pressure wipin work site utilizing HEPA equipped air filtration units or by oper means.
4. Seal holes, pipes, conduits, and punctures.
5. Construct anteroom and require all personnel to pass prough pis room so pey can be vacuumed using a HEPA vacuum cleaner before leaving work site or pey can wear clop or paper coveralls pat are removed each time pey leave work site.
6. All personnel entering work site are required to wear shoe covers. Shoe covers must be changed each time pe worker exits pe work area.
* For each CLASS - Infection Prevention approved hand wipes should be available at pe site during pe construction project.

# CLASS IV

1. Do not remove barriers from work area until completed project is poroughly cleaned.
2. Remove barrier materials carefully to minimize spreading of dirt and debris associated wip construction.
3. Vacuum work area wip HEPA filtered vacuums.
4. Clean/Dust area.
5. Upon completion, restore HVAC system where work was performed.

# Upon Completion of Project

1. Clean work area upon completion of task.

| | |Step 4. Identify the areas surrounding the project area, assessing potential impact| | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Unit Below|Unit Above|Lateral|Lateral|Behind|Front|
|Risk Group|Risk Group|Risk Group|Risk Group|Risk Group|Risk Group|

Step 5. Identify specific site of activity e.g., patient rooms, medication room, etc.

Step 6. Identify issues related to: ventilation, plumbing, electrical in terms of the occurrence of probable outages.

Step 7. Identify containment measures, using prior assessment. What types of barriers? (E.g., solids wall barriers); Will HEPA filtration be required?

(Note: Renovation/construction area shall be isolated from the occupied areas during construction and shall be negative with respect to surrounding areas)

Step 8. Consider potential risk of water damage. Is there a risk due to compromising structural integrity? (e.g., wall, ceiling, roof)

Step 9. Work hours: Can or will the work be done during non-patient care hours?

Step 10. Plan to discuss the following containment issues with the project team. E.g., traffic flow, housekeeping, debris removal (how and when),

New Construction:
Step 1. Do plans allow for an adequate number of isolation/negative airflow rooms?
Step 2. Do pe plans allow for pe required number & type of handwashing sinks?
Step 3. Does pe infection prevention & control staff agree wip pe minimum number of sinks for pis project
Step 4. Does pe infection prevention & control staff agree wip pe plans relative to clean and soiled utility rooms?

Identify and communicate the responsibility for project monitoring that includes infection prevention & control concerns and risks. The ICRA may be modified throughout the project. Revisions must be communicated to the Project Manager.
