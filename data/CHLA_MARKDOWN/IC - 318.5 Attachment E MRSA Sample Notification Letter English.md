IC – 318.5 Attachment E MRSA Sample Notification Letter

IC – 318 MRSA Screening and Surveillance

Dear:

At Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, newly admitted patients are required by California state law to be screened for Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) - see attached information. During your child’s most recent visit, this screen tested positive for MRSA.

MRSA is a type of bacteria (germ) that is often found on the skin and in the nose of healthy people. Most people who carry MRSA on their skin or in their nose will not experience any symptoms.

These bacteria can cause infections, which are most likely to happen in people who are already ill.

We encourage you to read the MRSA handout and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control.

No follow up is needed at this time. If you have questions, please talk to your Primary Care doctor.

Sincerely,
