POLICY NUMBER: IC – 716.0 CHAPTER: ENTERPRISE – INFECTION CONTROL PAGE 1 of 8

# PURPOSE:

This policy covers cleaning and low-level disinfection of equipment and surfaces in the healthcare environment. Accumulation of dust, soil and microbial contaminants on environmental surfaces may create a potential reservoir for microorganisms. These microorganisms could be easily transmitted via hands when contacting contaminated surfaces and cause nosocomial infections. Effective and efficient cleaning methods and schedules are necessary to maintain clean and healthy environments in healthcare settings.

# SCOPE:

This policy is applicable to environmental services and outpatient clinical areas.

# DEFINITIONS:

1. Reusable patient care item/equipment: An item or piece of equipment that is intended by the manufacturer to be reused on different patients.
2. Single use item/ device: An item that is intended by the manufacturer for a single use, use during a single procedure, or use on a single patient. Refer to manufacturer instructions for cleaning of items that can be used on a single patient multiple times.
3. Non-critical item: A patient care item that comes into contact with intact skin only. These items require at minimum, low-level disinfection in between each patient use.
4. Cleaning: The removal of visible soil (e.g. organic and inorganic material) from objects and surfaces. It is normally accomplished by manual or mechanical means using water with detergents or enzymatic products.
5. Low-Level Disinfection: A process that eliminates many or all pathogenic (disease causing) microorganisms on inanimate objects with the exception of bacterial spores. Sufficient for disinfecting non-critical items.
6. Dwell Time/ Contact Time: The amount of time a surface must remain visibly wet for the disinfectant to effectively kill pathogens.
