IC 207A: COVID-19 Pandemic Modifications – Use and Care of Manikins

During infectious disease events of epidemiological importance (i.e. internal outbreaks, pandemics, etc.), the cleaning and disinfection of CPR Manikins will be modified in accordance to recommendations by American Heart Association and CHLA’s Infection Prevention and Control Program.

During CPR Marathons

- As a modification, students will not be performing mouth-to-mouth demonstration on the manikins even with the use of the face shield barrier.
- A bag-valve mask will, however, be used to demonstrate skill related to bag-valve mask use.
- Manikins will be wiped down with hospital-approved disinfectant wipes after use by each student.
- Students will be required to wear gloves during demonstration of skills on the manikins.

Cleaning and Disinfection

- Manikins are to be cleaned and disinfected using CHLA-approved products between all students.
- As per usual, the manikins are terminally cleaned quarterly.
- Manikins are cleaned prior to all classes and fresh lungs are inserted for use.
