# PURPOSE:

In order to prevent the spread of infection from one person to another, a thorough cleaning of the CPR Training manikins is necessary after each training session.

The following policy delineates cleaning and decontamination procedures for CPR training manikins prior to reuse.

# PROCEDURES:

1. Students, which may include staff or families, should be told that CPR training will involve physical contact with manikins.
2. Participants and instructors should refrain and postpone from participating in CPR training if they are in the active stages of an infectious disease.
3. Prior to start of class, CPR students should notify the instructor before using the manikin if they have open sores or cuts on their hands, mouth, or area around the mouth, are seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG) or have any chronic illness especially: HBV, AIDS or HIV positivity.
- The instructor will provide the student with an individual face to use during class, or the student can be the last person to use manikin before terminal cleaning is done.
4. Students should be instructed to perform hand hygiene, remove all lipstick, avoid eating, and dispose of chewing gum prior to contact with the manikin.
5. Students may use an individual protective face shield to use for adult and infant manikins. When using multiple manikins, students should be assigned in pairs (per manikin).
6. The instructor is responsible for cleaning the manikin during and after each class. In addition, the manikin should be routinely checked for signs of deterioration.
7. During infectious disease events of epidemiological importance (i.e., internal outbreaks, pandemics, etc) the cleaning and disinfection of CPR manikins will be modified in accordance to recommendations by American Heart Association and CHLA’s infection prevention program. See attachment 207.1 for AHA Cleaning and Disinfection guidelines.
