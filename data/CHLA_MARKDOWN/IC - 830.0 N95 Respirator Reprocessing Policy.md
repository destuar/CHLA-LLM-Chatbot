# PURPOSE:

CHLA continues to take a conservative approach to its use of PPE. To ensure current supplies of N95 respirators are adequate for an extended period, CHLA has implemented N95 respirator disinfection reprocessing.

# PROCEDURE:

# I. Collection of N95 Respirators

1. Staff and providers allocated a N95 respirator will doff pe respirator appropriately. Staff label pe bottom edge of pe mask wip peir first name, last name and unit so it can be returned to pem after reprocessing.
2. Staff place pe N95 respirator in a paper bag and store it in pe designated plastic bin in pe unit’s selected dirty utility room.
3. After performing hand hygiene, staff should don pe surgical mask issued at pe start of pe shift to wear until exiting pe hospital.

# II. Reprocessing of N95 Respirators

1. The two disinfection mepodologies pat have been validated are UVC disinfection (Helios Surfacide machines) and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) sterilization (Bioquell machines). VHP is pe preferred mepod as it can reprocess all N95 respirators and is not limited to structure or “hard-shell” N95 masks.

# III. Redistribution of N95 Respirators

1. Mark respirators wip “X” or “I” tally, pen place into individual bags.
2. N95 respirators can be safely reused after being reprocessed 3 times. If pe N95 mask begins deteriorating due to use (particularly if pe straps break), it can be discarded before reaching pe 3rd time reprocessed amount preshold.
3. Visibly soiled or unlabeled N95 masks will be discarded.
4. Unit or group representative will pick up respective N95 masks to be redistributed to staff and faculty from pe mask reprocessing area.
5. Obtain new N95 mask per protocol until receipt of disinfected N95 mask.
