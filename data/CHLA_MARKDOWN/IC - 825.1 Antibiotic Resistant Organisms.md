MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus) - see Staphylococcus aureus

Staphylococcus aureus:

- If resistant to methicillin/oxacillin. Droplet Precautions. Contact Precautions.
- If intermediate resistance to vancomycin, also notify Infection Prevention and Control ASAP.

Stenotrophomonas maltophilia:

Any + culture isolated until susceptibilities reviewed by Infection Prevention and Control
Droplet Precautions.
Contact Precautions.
Off antibiotics for 2 weeks and culture negative from the same site.
Yes.

Tuberculosis:

Isolate is resistant to any TB drug and/or TB source has known drug resistant TB and/or clinical suspicion for resistance (per ID or Epidemiology consult).
Airborne Precautions.
Airborne Precautions.
Duration of hospital stay.
Yes, until deemed not contagious (2 weeks Antbx, sputum AFB negative and improved)

VRE (Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci) – see Enterococcus

Epidemiologically significant organisms:

Any organisms involved in a cluster of nosocomial infections

Note: This list should not be considered all inclusive. Other microorganisms with antibiotic-resistance profiles considered by Epidemiology or the Infection Control Committee to be epidemiologically significant may be added. Isolation measures may be implemented or discontinued at the discretion of the infection prevention team or hospital epidemiologist.

Off antibiotics for at least 1 week and then until 3 negative cultures from nares and site(s)
