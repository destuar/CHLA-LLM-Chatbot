# N95 Respirator Seal Check

Putting On The Respirator

Position the respirator in your hands with the nosepiece at your fingertips. Cup the respirator in your hand allowing the headbands to hang below your hand. Hold the respirator under your chin with the nosepiece up. The "top strap (on single or double strap respirators) goes over and rests at the top back of your head. The bottom strap positioned around the neck and below the crisscross straps. Do not place your fingertips down both sides of the metal noseclip present; slide the metal strip to mold the nose area to the shape of your nose.

Checking Your Seal?

Place both hands over the respirator; take a quick breath to check whether the respirator seals tightly to the face. If you feel proper seal leakage, readjust the nosepiece as described. If air leaks at the mask edges, re-adjust the straps along the sides of your head until a proper seal is achieved. If you cannot achieve proper seal due to air leakage, ask for help or try a different size or model.

Removing Your Respirator

DO NOT TOUCH the front of the respirator! It may be contaminated! Remove by pulling the bottom strap over the back of the head followed by the top strap, without touching the respirator. Discard in a waste container. WASH YOUR HANDS!
