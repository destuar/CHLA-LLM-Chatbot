# PURPOSE:

Since 1994, State Health and Safety Codes mandate that patients suspected or confirmed with TB may not be discharged or transferred from a hospital without prior Los Angeles County Dept. of Public Health (LACDPH) TB Control Program approval.

To facilitate a timely and appropriate discharge, the provider should submit a written discharge plan to Tuberculosis Control 1 to 2 days prior to the anticipated discharge. Tuberculosis Control will review the discharge plan for approval or denial.

# PROCEDURE:

1. Within one working day of identification, the physician responsible for a case of suspected or confirmed TB must notify Infection Prevention and Control (IPC). LACDPH depends on timely reporting to halt TB transmission. Suspected cases include:

- Patients with signs and symptoms consistent with TB
- Patients with an abnormal chest X-ray consistent with TB
- Patients with a sputum or gastric aspirate smear that is positive for AFB;
- Patients with a positive culture for M. tuberculosis complex
- Immunocompromised patients who have a new finding on chest x-ray consistent with active TB.
- Patients started on multiple therapy (two or more drugs) for clinical suspicion of active TB;
- Patients who are 3 yrs old or younger with a positive PPD
- Patients with a pathology report consistent with tuberculosis
2. The IPC staff will report the case to TB Control, using the Confidential Hospitalized TB Suspect Case Report (H-803) and notify the patient’s Clinical Care Coordinator (CCC) of the suspected case.
3. To facilitate a timely and appropriate discharge, the CCC should submit a written discharge plan to TB Control one to two days prior to the anticipated discharge. TB Control will review the discharge plan for approval or denial.
4. An active, infectious TB case with previously positive sputum smears must meet the following criteria to be discharged:

- Have three (3) consecutive negative AFB sputum smear or gastric aspirate results collected at least 8 hours apart with at least one collected early morning (note that specimens collected in early AM produce the best results); OR
- All of the following criteria must be met:
