# IC – 301.1 Appendix A:

Preamble The mode(s) and risk of transmission for each specific disease agent included in Appendix A were reviewed. Principle sources consulted for the development of disease-specific recommendations for Appendix A included infectious disease manuals and textbooks 833, 1043, 1044. The published literature was searched for evidence of person-to-person transmission in healthcare and non-healthcare settings with a focus on reported outbreaks that would assist in developing recommendations for all settings where healthcare is delivered. Criteria used to assign Transmission-Based Precautions categories follow:

- A Transmission-Based Precautions category was assigned if there was strong evidence for person-to-person transmission via droplet, contact, or airborne routes in healthcare or non-healthcare settings and/or if patient factors (e.g., diapered infants, diarrhea, draining wounds) increased the risk of transmission
- Transmission-Based Precautions category assignments reflect the predominant mode(s) of transmission
- If there was no evidence for person-to-person transmission by droplet, contact or airborne routes, Standard Precautions were assigned
- If there was a low risk for person-to-person transmission and no evidence of healthcare-associated transmission, Standard Precautions were assigned
- Standard Precautions were assigned for bloodborne pathogens (e.g., hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus) as per CDC recommendations for Universal Precautions issued in 1988 780. Subsequent experience has confirmed the efficacy of Standard Precautions to prevent exposure to infected blood and body fluid 778, 779, 866.

Additional information relevant to use of precautions was added in the comments column to assist the caregiver in decision-making. Citations were added as needed to support a change in or provide additional evidence for recommendations for a specific disease and for new infectious agents (e.g., SARS-CoV, avian influenza) that have been added to Appendix A. The reader may refer to more detailed discussion concerning modes of transmission and emerging pathogens in the background text and for MDRO control in Appendix B.

Dressing covers and contains drainage

Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis for some blood exposures 866.

Not transmitted from person to person

Person to person transmission is rare. Transmission in settings for the mentally challenged and in a family group has been reported 1045. Use care when handling diapered infants and mentally challenged persons 1046.

Infected patients do not generally pose a transmission risk. Transmission through non-intact skin contact with draining lesions possible, therefore use Contact Precautions if large amount of uncontained drainage.

Precautions

Use Contact Precautions for diapered or incontinent persons for the duration of illness or to control institutional outbreaks.

Persons who clean areas heavily contaminated with feces or vomitus may benefit from wearing masks since virus can be aerosolized from these body substances; ensure consistent environmental cleaning and disinfection with focus on restrooms even when apparently unsoiled. Hypochlorite solutions may be required when there is continued transmission. Alcohol is less active, but there is no evidence that alcohol antiseptic handrubs are not effective for hand decontamination. Cohorting of affected patients to separate airspaces and toilet facilities may help interrupt transmission during outbreaks.

Ensure consistent environmental cleaning and disinfection and frequent removal of soiled diapers. Prolonged shedding may occur.

Precautions

Comments

MDROs judged by the infection control program, based on local, state, regional, or national recommendations, to be of clinical and epidemiologic significance. Contact Precautions recommended in settings with evidence of ongoing transmission, acute care settings with increased risk for transmission or wounds that cannot be contained by dressings. See recommendations for management options in Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms In Healthcare Settings, 2006 870. Contact state health department for guidance regarding new or emerging MDRO.

After onset of swelling; susceptible HCWs should not provide care if immune caregivers are available.

Note: (Recent assessment of outbreaks in healthy 18-24 year olds has indicated that salivary viral shedding occurred early in the course of illness and that 5 days of isolation after onset of parotitis may be appropriate in community settings; however the implications for healthcare personnel and high-risk patient populations remain to be clarified.)

Precautions

Transmission from person to person is rare; vertical transmission from mother to child, transmission through organs and blood transfusion rare

Droplet Precautions for the first 24 hours after implementation of antibiotic therapy if Group A streptococcus is a likely etiology

Discontinue precautions only when patient is improving clinically, and drainage has ceased or there are three consecutive negative cultures of continued drainage 1025, 1026. Examine for evidence of active pulmonary tuberculosis.

Examine for evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. For infants and children, use Airborne Precautions until active pulmonary tuberculosis in visiting family members ruled out 42

Discontinue precautions only when patient on effective therapy is improving clinically and has three consecutive sputum smears negative for acid-fast bacilli collected on separate days(MMWR 2005; 54: RR-17 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5417a1.htm?s_cid=rr5417a1_e) 12.

Precautions

Comments

Use Contact Precautions if there is copious drainage

Not an infectious condition

Follow organism-specific (strep, staph most frequent) recommendations and consider magnitude of drainage

Susceptible HCWs should not enter room if immune caregivers are available; no recommendation for face protection of immune HCWs; no recommendation for type of protection, i.e. surgical mask or respirator for susceptible HCWs. In immunocompromised host with varicella pneumonia, prolong duration of precautions for duration of illness. Post-exposure prophylaxis: provide post-exposure vaccine ASAP but within 120 hours; for susceptible exposed persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated (immunocompromised persons, pregnant women, newborns whose mother’s varicella onset is <5days before delivery or within 48 hrs after delivery) provide VZIG, when available, within 96 hours; if unavailable, use IVIG, Use Airborne Precautions for exposed susceptible persons and exclude exposed susceptible healthcare workers beginning 8 days after first exposure until 21 days after last exposure or 28 if received VZIG, regardless of postexposure vaccination. 1036.

Single-patient room preferred. Emphasize: 1) use of sharps safety

|1983|CDC Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals|

1985-88 Universal Precautions

- Developed in response to HIV/AIDS epidemic
- Dictated application of Blood and Body Fluid precautions to all patients, regardless of infection status
- Did not apply to feces, nasal secretions, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomitus unless contaminated by visible blood
- Added personal protective equipment to protect HCWs from mucous membrane exposures
- Handwashing recommended immediately after glove removal
- Added specific recommendations for handling needles and other sharp devices; concept became integral to OSHA’s 1991 rule on occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens in healthcare settings

Introduced seven isolation precaution categories with color-coded cards: Strict, Respiratory, Protective, Enteric, Wound and Skin, Discharge, and Blood

- No user decision-making required
- Simplicity a strength; over isolation prescribed for some infections
- Same conceptual framework as 1st edition

Provided two systems for isolation: category-specific and disease-specific

- Protective Isolation eliminated; Blood Precautions expanded to include Body Fluids
- Categories included Strict, Contact, Respiratory, AFB, Enteric, Drainage/Secretion, Blood and Body Fluids
- Emphasized decision-making by users
19871102 Body Substance Isolation

19961 Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals

- Derived from Garner ICHE 1996
- Emphasized avoiding contact with all moist and potentially infectious body substances except sweat even if blood not present
- Shared some features with Universal Precautions
- Weak on infections transmitted by large droplets or by contact with dry surfaces
- Did not emphasize need for special ventilation to contain airborne infections
- Handwashing after glove removal not specified in the absence of visible soiling
- Prepared by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC)
- Melded major features of Universal Precautions and Body Substance Isolation into Standard Precautions to be used with all patients at all times
- Included three transmission-based precaution categories: airborne, droplet, and contact
- Listed clinical syndromes that should dictate use of empiric isolation until an etiological diagnosis is established

GIT: Ingestion of toxin-containing food, RT: Inhalation of toxin containing aerosol cause disease.

Comment: Toxin ingested or potentially delivered by aerosol in bioterrorist incidents. LD50 for type A is 0.001 g/ml/kg.

Incubation Period: 1-5 days.

Clinical Features: Ptosis, generalized weakness, dizziness, dry mouth and throat, blurred vision, diplopia, dysarthria,
dysphonia, and dysphagia followed by symmetrical descending paralysis and respiratory failure.
Diagnosis

Clinical diagnosis; identification of toxin in stool, serology unless toxin-containing material available for toxin neutralization bioassays.

Infectivity

Recommended Precautions

Standard Precautions.

Disease: Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever

Site(s) of Infection; Transmission

As a rule infection develops after exposure of mucous membranes or RT, or prough broken skin or percutaneous injury.

Mode

Incubation Period: 2-19 days, usually 5-10 days

Clinical Features

Febrile illnesses wip malaise, myalgias, headache, vomiting and diarrhea pat are rapidly complicated by hypotension, shock, and hemorrhagic features. Massive hemorrhage in &lt; 50% pts.

Diagnosis

Etiologic diagnosis can be made using RT-PCR, serologic detection of antibody and antigen, papologic assessment wip immunohistochemistry and viral culture wip EM confirmation of morphology.

Infectivity

Person-to-person transmission primarily occurs prough unprotected contact wip blood and body fluids; percutaneous injuries (e.g., needlestick) associated wip a high rate of transmission; transmission in healpcare settings has been reported but is prevented by use of barrier precautions.

Recommended Precautions

Hemorrhagic fever specific barrier precautions: If disease is believed to be related to intentional release of a bioweapon, epidemiology of transmission is unpredictable pending observation of disease transmission. Until pe nature of pe papogen is understood and its transmission pattern confirmed, Standard, Contact and Airborne Precautions should be used. Once pe papogen is characterized, if pe epidemiology of transmission is consistent wip natural disease, Droplet Precautions can be substituted for Airborne Precautions. Emphasize: 1) use of sharps safety devices and safe work practices, 2) hand hygiene; 3) barrier protection against blood and body fluids upon entry into room (single gloves and fluid-resistant or impermeable gown, face/eye protection wip masks, goggles or face shields); and 4) appropriate waste handling. Use N95 or higher respirators when performing aerosol-generating procedures. In settings where AIIRs are unavailable or pe large numbers of patients cannot be accommodated by existing AIIRs, observe Droplet Precautions (plus Standard Precautions and Contact Precautions) and segregate patients from pose not suspected of VHF infection. Limit blood draws to pose essential to care. See text for discussion and Appendix A for recommendations for naturally
occurring VHFs.

|Disease|Plague|
|---|---|
|Site(s) of Infection;|RT: Inhalation of respiratory droplets.|
|Transmission Mode|Comment: Pneumonic plague most likely to occur if used as a biological weapon, but some cases of bubonic and primary septicemia may also occur. Infective dose 100 to 500 bacteria|
|Incubation Period|1 to 6, usually 2 to 3 days.|
|Clinical Features|Pneumonic: fever, chills, headache, cough, dyspnea, rapid progression of weakness, and in a later stage hemoptysis, circulatory collapse, and bleeding diathesis|
|Diagnosis|Presumptive diagnosis from Gram stain or Wayson stain of sputum, blood, or lymph node aspirate; definitive diagnosis from cultures of same material, or paired acute/convalescent serology.|
|Infectivity|Person-to-person transmission occurs via respiratory droplets risk of transmission is low during first 20-24 hours of illness and requires close contact. Respiratory secretions probably are not infectious within a few hours after initiation of appropriate therapy.|
|Recommended Precautions|Standard Precautions, Droplet Precautions until patients have received 48 hours of appropriate therapy. Chemoprophylaxis: Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for HCWs with close contact exposure.|

Pneumonic plague is not as contagious as is often thought. Historical accounts and contemporary evidence indicate that persons with plague usually only transmit the infection when the disease is in the end stage. These persons cough copious amounts of bloody sputum that contains many plague bacteria. Patients in the early stage of primary pneumonic plague (approximately the first 20–24 h) apparently pose little risk. Antibiotic medication rapidly clears the sputum of plague bacilli, so that a patient generally is not infective within hours after initiation of effective antibiotic treatment. This means that in modern times many patients will never reach a stage where they pose a significant risk to others. Even in the end stage of disease, transmission only occurs after close contact. Simple protective measures, such as wearing masks, good hygiene, and avoiding close contact, have been effective to interrupt transmission during many pneumonic plague outbreaks. In the United States, the last known cases of person to person transmission of pneumonic plague occurred in 1925.

|Disease|Smallpox|
|---|---|
|Site(s) of Infection|RT Inhalation of droplet or, rarely, aerosols; and skin lesions (contact with virus).|
|Transmission|Comment: If used as a biological weapon, natural disease, which has not occurred since 1977, will likely result.|
|Mode| |
|Incubation Period|7 to 19 days (mean 12 days)|
|Clinical Features|Fever, malaise, backache, headache, and often vomiting for 2-3 days; then generalized papular or maculopapular rash (more on face and extremities), which becomes vesicular (on day 4 or 5) and then pustular; lesions all in same stage.|
|Diagnosis|Electron microscopy of vesicular fluid or culture of vesicular fluid by WHO approved laboratory (CDC); detection by PCR available only in select LRN labs, CDC and USAMRID|
|Infectivity|Secondary attack rates up to 50% in unvaccinated persons; infected persons may transmit disease from time rash appears until all lesions have crusted over (about 3 weeks); greatest infectivity during first 10 days of rash. Combined use of Standard, Contact, and Airborne Precautionsb until all scabs have separated (3-4 weeks).|
|Recommended Precautions|Only immune HCWs to care for pts; post-exposure vaccine within 4 days. Vaccinia: HCWs cover vaccination site with gauze and semi-permeable dressing until scab separates (>21 days). Observe hand hygiene. Adverse events with virus-containing lesions: Standard plus Contact Precautions until all lesions crusted. Transmission by the airborne route is a rare event; Airborne Precautions is recommended when possible, but in the event of mass exposures, barrier precautions and containment within a designated area are most important 204, 212. Vaccinia adverse events with lesions containing infectious virus include inadvertent autoinoculation, ocular lesions (blepharitis, conjunctivitis), generalized vaccinia, progressive vaccinia, eczema vaccinatum; bacterial superinfection also requires addition of contact precautions if exudates cannot be contained 216, 217.|
|Disease|Tularemia|
|---|---|
|Site(s) of Infection|RT: Inhalation of aerosolized bacteria. GIT: Ingestion of food or drink contaminated with aerosolized bacteria.|
|Transmission|Inhalation of aerosolized bacteria.|
|Mode|Comment: Pneumonic or typhoidal disease likely to occur after bioterrorist event using aerosol delivery. Infective dose 10-50 bacteria|
|Incubation Period|2 to 10 days, usually 3 to 5 days|
|Clinical Features|Pneumonic: malaise, cough, sputum production, dyspnea; Typhoidal: fever, prostration, weight loss and frequently an associated pneumonia.|
|Diagnosis|Diagnosis usually made with serology on acute and convalescent serum specimens; bacterium can be detected by PCR (LRN) or isolated from blood and other body fluids on cysteine-enriched media or mouse inoculation.|
|Infectivity|Person-to-person spread is rare. Laboratory workers who encounter/handle cultures of this organism are at high risk for disease if exposed.|
|Recommended Precautions|Standard Precautions|
|COMPONENT|RECOMMENDATIONS|
|---|---|
|Hand hygiene|After touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, contaminated items; immediately after removing gloves; between patient contacts.|
|Personal protective equipment (PPE)| |
|Gloves|For touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, contaminated items; for touching mucous membranes and nonintact skin|
|Gown|During procedures and patient-care activities when contact of clothing/exposed skin with blood/body fluids, secretions, and excretions is anticipated.|
|Mask, eye protection (goggles), face shield*|During procedures and patient-care activities likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, especially suctioning, endotracheal intubation|
|Soiled patient-care equipment|Handle in a manner that prevents transfer of microorganisms to others and to the environment; wear gloves if visibly contaminated; perform hand hygiene.|
|Environmental control|Develop procedures for routine care, cleaning, and disinfection of environmental surfaces, especially frequently touched surfaces in patient-care areas.|
|Textiles and laundry|Handle in a manner that prevents transfer of microorganisms to others and to the environment|
|Needles and other sharps|Do not recap, bend, break, or hand-manipulate used needles; if recapping is required, use a one-handed scoop technique only; use safety features when available; place used sharps in puncture-resistant container|
|Patient resuscitation|Use mouthpiece, resuscitation bag, other ventilation devices to prevent contact with mouth and oral secretions|
Patient placement

Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette
(source containment of infectious respiratory secretions in symptomatic patients, beginning at initial point of encounter e.g., triage and reception areas in emergency departments and physician offices)

During aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or proven infections transmitted by respiratory aerosols (e.g., SARS), wear a fit-tested N95 or higher respirator in addition to gloves, gown, and face/eye protection.

Prioritize for single-patient room if patient is at increased risk of transmission, is likely to contaminate the environment, does not maintain appropriate hygiene, or is at increased risk of acquiring infection or developing adverse outcome following infection.

Instruct symptomatic persons to cover mouth/nose when sneezing/coughing; use tissues and dispose in no-touch receptacle; observe hand hygiene after soiling of hands with respiratory secretions; wear surgical mask if tolerated or maintain spatial separation, &gt;3 feet if possible.

Components of a Protective Environment
(Adapted from MMWR 2003; 52 [RR-10])

# I. Patients: allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant (HSCT) only

- Maintain in PE room except for required diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that cannot be performed in the room, e.g. radiology, operating room
- Respiratory protection e.g., N95 respirator, for the patient when leaving PE during periods of construction

# II. Standard and Expanded Precautions

- Hand hygiene observed before and after patient contact
- Gown, gloves, mask NOT required for HCWs or visitors for routine entry into the room
- Use of gown, gloves, mask by HCWs and visitors according to Standard Precautions and as indicated for suspected or proven infections for which Transmission-Based Precautions are recommended

# III. Engineering

- Central or point-of-use HEPA (99.97% efficiency) filters capable of removing particles 0.3 μm in diameter for supply (incoming) air
- Well-sealed rooms
- Proper construction of windows, doors, and intake and exhaust ports
- Ceilings: smooth, free of fissures, open joints, crevices
- Walls sealed above and below the ceiling
- If leakage detected, locate source and make necessary repairs
- Ventilation to maintain >12 ACH
- Directed air flow: air supply and exhaust grills located so that clean, filtered air enters from one side of the room, flows across the patient’s bed, exits on opposite side of the room
- Positive room air pressure in relation to the corridor
- Pressure differential of >2.5 Pa [0.01” water gauge]
- Monitor and document results of air flow patterns daily using visual methods (e.g., flutter strips, smoke tubes) or a hand held pressure gauge
- Self-closing door on all room exits
- Maintain back-up ventilation equipment (e.g., portable units for fans or filters) for emergency provision of ventilation requirements for PE areas and take immediate steps to restore the fixed ventilation system
- For patients who require both a PE and Airborne Infection Isolation, use an anteroom to ensure proper air balance relationships and provide independent exhaust of contaminated air to the outside or place a HEPA filter in the exhaust duct. If an anteroom is not available, place patient in an AIIR and use portable ventilation units, industrial-grade HEPA filters to enhance filtration of spores.
# IV. Surfaces

Daily wet-dusting of horizontal surfaces using clops moistened wip EPA-registered hospital disinfectant/detergent
Avoid dusting mepods pat disperse dust
No carpeting in patient rooms or hallways
No upholstered furniture and furnishings

# V. Other

No flowers (fresh or dried) or potted plants in PE rooms or areas
Use vacuum cleaner equipped wip HEPA filters when vacuum cleaning is necessary
