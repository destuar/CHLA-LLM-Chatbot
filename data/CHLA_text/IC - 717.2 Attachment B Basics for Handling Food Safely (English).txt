The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is the public health agency

• 
Clean - Wash hands and surfaces often. 
• 
Separate - Don’t cross-contaminate. 
• 
Cook - Cook to the right temperature. 
• 
Chill - Refrigerate promptly. 
Shopping
• 
Purchase refrigerated or frozen items after 
selecting your non-perishables. 
• 
Never choose meat or poultry in packaging that 
is torn or leaking. 
• 
Do not buy food past “Sell-By,” “Use-By,” or 
other expiration dates. 
Storage
• 
Always refrigerate perishable food within 2 
hours--1 hour when the temperature is above 
90 °F (32.2 ºC). 
• 
Check the temperature of your refrigerator 
and freezer with an appliance thermometer. 
The refrigerator should be at 40 °F (4.4 ºC) 
or below and the freezer at 0 °F (-17.7 ºC) or 
below. 
• 
Cook or freeze fresh poultry, fish, ground 
meats, and variety meats within 2 days; other 
beef, veal, lamb, or pork, within 3 to 5 days. 
• 
Perishable food such as meat and poultry 
should be wrapped securely to maintain quality 
and to prevent meat juices from getting onto 
other food. 
• 
To maintain quality when freezing meat and 
poultry in its original package, wrap the 
package again with foil or plastic wrap that is 
recommended for the freezer. 
• 
Canned foods are safe indefinitely as long as 
they are not exposed to freezing temperatures, 
or temperatures above 90 °F. (32.2 ºC)  If the 
cans look ok, they are safe to use.  Discard 
cans that are dented, rusted, or swollen. High-
acid canned food (tomatoes, fruits) will keep 
their best quality for 12 to 18 months; low-acid 
canned food (meats, vegetables) for 2 to 5 years.
Basics for Handling Food Safely 
Safe steps in food handling, cooking, and storage are essential to prevent foodborne illness. You can’t see, smell, 
or taste harmful bacteria that may cause illness. In every step of food preparation, follow the four steps of the 
Food Safe Families campaign to keep food safe: 
Preparation
• 
Always wash hands before and after handling 
food. 
• 
Don’t cross-contaminate. Keep raw meat, 
poultry, fish, and their juices away from other 
food. After cutting raw meats, wash hands, 
cutting board, knife, and counter tops with hot, 
soapy water. 
• 
Marinate meat and poultry in a covered dish in 
the refrigerator. 
• 
Sanitize cutting boards by using a solution of 1 
teaspoon chlorine bleach in 1 quart of water. 
Thawing
• 
Refrigerator: The refrigerator allows slow, safe 
thawing. Make sure thawing meat and poultry 
juices do not drip onto other food. 
• 
Cold Water: For faster thawing, place food in 
a leak-proof plastic bag. Submerge in cold tap 
water. Change the water every 30 minutes. 
Cook immediately after thawing. 
• 
Microwave: Cook meat and poultry 
immediately after microwave thawing. 
Cooking
• 
Cook all raw beef, pork, lamb and veal steaks, 
chops, and roasts to a minimum internal 
temperature of 145 °F (62.8 ºC) as measured 
with a food thermometer before removing meat 
from the heat source. For safety and quality, 
allow meat to rest for at least three minutes 
before carving or consuming. For reasons of 
personal preference, consumers may choose to 
cook meat to higher temperatures.
• 
Ground meat: Cook all raw ground beef, pork, 
lamb, and veal to an internal temperature of 
160 °F (71.1 ºC) as measured with a food 
thermometer.
• 
Poultry: Cook all poultry to an internal 
temperature of 165 °F (73.9 °C) as measured 
with a food thermometer.

Serving
• 
Hot food should be held at 140 °F (60 °C) or 
warmer. 
• 
Cold food should be held at 40 °F (4.4 ºC) or 
colder. 
• 
When serving food at a buffet, keep food hot 
with chafing dishes, slow cookers, and warming 
trays. Keep food cold by nesting dishes in bowls 
of ice or use small serving trays and replace 
them often. 
• 
Perishable food should not be left out more than 
2 hours at room temperature--1 hour when the 
temperature is above 90 °F (32.2 ºC). 
Leftovers
• 
Discard any food left out at room temperature for 
more than 2 hours--1 hour if the temperature was 
above 90 °F (32.2 ºC). 
• 
Place food into shallow containers and immediately 
put in the refrigerator or freezer for rapid cooling. 
• 
Use cooked leftovers within 4 days.
• 
Reheat leftovers to 165 °F (73.9 °C).
Refreezing
Meat and poultry defrosted in the refrigerator may be 
refrozen before or after cooking. If thawed by other 
methods, cook before refreezing.
COLD STORAGE CHART
These short, but safe, time limits will help keep refrigerated food from spoiling or becoming dangerous to eat. 
Because freezing keeps food safe indefinitely, recommended storage times are for quality only.
