Pre-Operative Bathing
Bathing prior to your child’s surgery



Your child is scheduled for a surgical procedure. Before surgery, you can play an important role in your child’s health to reduce infection. You can reduce the number of germs on your child’s skin through careful washing and bathing. Your child will need to bathe or shower the night before using regular soap. Depending on the surgery, your child may not be able to take a bath/shower with soap and water for a few days.
