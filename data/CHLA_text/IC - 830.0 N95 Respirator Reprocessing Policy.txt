PURPOSE:

CHLA continues to take a conservative approach to its use of PPE. To ensure current supplies of N95 respirators are adequate for an extended period, CHLA has implemented N95 respirator disinfection reprocessing.

PROCEDURE:

Collection of N95 Respirators
Staff and providers allocated a N95 respirator will doff the respirator appropriately. Staff label the bottom edge of the mask with their first name, last name and unit so it can be returned to them after reprocessing.
Staff place the N95 respirator in a paper bag and store it in the designated plastic bin in the unit’s selected dirty utility room.
After performing hand hygiene, staff should don the surgical mask issued at the start of the shift to wear until exiting the hospital.

Reprocessing of N95 Respirators
The two disinfection methodologies that have been validated are UVC disinfection (Helios Surfacide machines) and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) sterilization (Bioquell machines).  VHP is the preferred method as it can reprocess all N95 respirators and is not limited to structure or “hard-shell” N95 masks.

Redistribution of N95 Respirators
Mark respirators with “X”or “I” tally, then place into individual bags.
N95 respirators can be safely reused after being reprocessed 3 times. If the N95 mask begins deteriorating due to use (particularly if the straps break), it can be discarded before reaching the 3rd time reprocessed amount threshold.
Visibly soiled or unlabeled N95 masks will be discarded.
Unit or group representative will pick up respective N95 masks to be redistributed to staff and faculty from the mask reprocessing area.
Obtain new N95 mask per protocol until receipt of disinfected N95 mask.
