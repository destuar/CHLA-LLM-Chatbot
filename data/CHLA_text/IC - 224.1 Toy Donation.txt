highest quality of care. … 
 
We greatly appreciate your generosity and caring for the children we serve here at 
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). When choosing items to be given to our 
patients please help us to ensure that our patients and their siblings have access to 
clean and safe play equipment, toys, and other supplies by following the 
recommendations listed below: 
 
 Toys provided for distribution to patients should be made of materials that can 
be easily sanitized/ wiped down with a disinfectant (i.e. plastic, rubber, vinyl, 
treated woods and metals).  
 
 Please avoid donating toys with porous surfaces (e.g. stuffed animals) that cannot 
be effectively sanitized or wiped down. These toys can become contaminated 
with dangerous bacteria and viruses that cannot be cleaned and therefore put our 
patients at risk. 
 
 
 
Thank you,
