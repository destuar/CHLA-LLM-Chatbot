square feet


removal of any fixed building components or assemblies 
Includes, but is not limited to: 

sanding of walls for painting or wall covering


Step 5. Identify specific site of activity e.g., patient rooms, medication room, etc. 
__________________________________________________________________ 
Step 6. Identify issues related to: ventilation, plumbing, electrical in terms of the occurrence 
of probable outages. 
__________________________________________________________________ 
Step 7. Identify containment measures, using prior assessment.  What types of barriers? 
(E.g., solids wall barriers); Will HEPA filtration be required? 
_________________________________________________________________ 
(Note: Renovation/construction area shall be isolated from the occupied areas during construction and shall be 
negative with respect to surrounding areas) 
Step 8.  Consider potential risk of water damage. Is there a risk due to compromising 
structural integrity?  (e.g., wall, ceiling, roof) 
Step 9.  Work hours: Can or will the work be done during non-patient care hours? 
Step 10. Plan to discuss the following containment issues with the project team.
E.g., traffic flow, housekeeping, debris removal (how and when),
 New Construction:
Step 1. Do plans allow for adequate number of isolation/negative airflow rooms? 
Step 2. Do the plans allow for the required number & type of handwashing sinks? 
Step 3. Does the infection prevention & control staff agree with the minimum number of 
sinks for this project 
Step 4. Does the infection prevention & control staff agree with the plans relative to clean 
and soiled utility rooms?

 Identify and communicate the responsibility for project monitoring that includes infection 
prevention & control concerns and risks.  The ICRA may be modified throughout the project.  
Revisions must be communicated to the Project Manager.
