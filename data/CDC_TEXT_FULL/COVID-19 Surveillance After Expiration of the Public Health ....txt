topic? Authorizations to collect certain public health data expire at the end of the U.S.
public health emergency declaration on May 11, 2023. What is added by this report?
Changes  to  the  national  COVID-19  monitoring  strategy  and  COVID  Data  Tracker
capitalize on marked improvements in multiple surveillance systems. Weekly COVID-19
hospital admission levels and the percentage of all COVID-19–associated deaths will be
primary  surveillance  indicators.  Emergency  department  visits  and  percentage  of
positive  SARS-CoV-2  laboratory  test  results  will  help  detect  early  changes  in  trends.
Genomic  surveillance  will  continue  to  help  identify  and  monitor  SARS-CoV-2  variants.
What  are  the  implications  for  public  health  practice?  COVID-19  is  an  ongoing  public
health  problem  that  will  be  monitored  with  sustainable  data  sources  to  guide
prevention  efforts.  Views  equals  page  views  plus  PDF  downloads  Table  1  Table  2  On
January 31, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared,
under  Section  319  of  the  Public  Health  Service  Act,  a  U.S.  public  health  emergency
because of the emergence of a novel virus, SARS-CoV-2.* After 13 renewals, the public
health emergency will expire on May 11, 2023. Authorizations to collect certain public
health data will expire on that date as well. Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and the
effectiveness of prevention and control strategies remains a public health priority, and
a  number  of  surveillance  indicators  have  been  identified  to  facilitate  ongoing
monitoring.  After  expiration  of  the  public  health  emergency,  COVID-19–associated
hospital admission levels will be the primary indicator of COVID-19 trends to help guide
community  and  personal  decisions  related  to  risk  and  prevention  behaviors;  the
percentage  of  COVID-19–associated  deaths  among  all  reported  deaths,  based  on
provisional  death  certificate  data,  will  be  the  primary  indicator  used  to  monitor
COVID-19 mortality. Emergency department (ED) visits with a COVID-19 diagnosis and
the  percentage  of  positive  SARS-CoV-2  test  results,  derived  from  an  established
sentinel  network,  will  help  detect  early  changes  in  trends.  National  genomic
surveillance  will  continue  to  be  used  to  estimate  SARS-CoV-2  variant  proportions;
wastewater surveillance and traveler-based genomic surveillance will also continue to
be  used  to  monitor  SARS-CoV-2  variants.  Disease  severity  and  hospitalization-related
outcomes  are  monitored  via  sentinel  surveillance  and  large  health  care  databases.
Monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination coverage, vaccine effectiveness (VE), and vaccine
safety will also continue. Integrated strategies for surveillance of COVID-19 and other
respiratory  viruses  can  further  guide  prevention  efforts.  COVID-19–associated
hospitalizations and deaths are largely preventable through receipt of updated vaccines
and timely administration of therapeutics (1–4). Although COVID-19 no longer poses the
societal emergency that it did when it first emerged in late 2019, COVID-19 remains an
ongoing  public  health  challenge.  By  April  26,  2023,  more  than  104  million  U.S.
COVID-19 cases, 6 million related hospitalizations, and 1.1 million COVID-19–associated
deaths  were  reported  to  CDC  and  summarized  on  CDC’s  COVID  Data  Tracker.†
COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death during 2020 and 2021§ and the fourth
leading  cause  during  2022  (5).  To  mitigate  the  consequences  of  the  pandemic,
approximately  675  million  COVID-19  vaccine  doses  were  administered,  including  55
million updated (bivalent) booster doses. Based on seroprevalence data, infection- and
vaccine-induced population immunity in the United States was 95% by December 2021
(6). As a result, rates of COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths have declined
substantially  since  March  2022  (7).  This  report  describes  changes  to  the  national
COVID-19 surveillance strategy, data sources, and indicators that will be made after the
public  health  emergency  declaration  expires;  these  indicators  will  be  displayed  as
weekly  or  otherwise  scheduled  updates  to  CDC’s  COVID  Data  Tracker.  Top  Most
COVID-19 surveillance data sources will continue to be available after the public health
emergency  declaration  ends  on  May  11;  the  reporting  cadence  of  some  will  change,
and three will be discontinued (Table 1). Since December 15, 2022, daily reporting to
CDC’s National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) of aggregate counts of patients with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to acute care and critical access U.S. hospitals
has been required. After the public health emergency ends on May 11, 2023, a switch
to  a  weekly  cadence  of  national  reporting  will  affect  data  processing  and  introduce
reporting lag. NHSN data on COVID-19 hospital admissions per 100,000 population will
be the primary surveillance indicator to help guide community and individual decisions
related to risk and prevention behaviors. These data have similar suitability for tracking
local  COVID-19  activity  as  do  COVID-19  Community  Levels  (CCLs)  (8)  and  will  be
updated  weekly  on  COVID  Data  Tracker  at  the  county,¶  state,  regional,  and  national
levels.  Considerable gains in  the timeliness of National  Vital  Statistics System (NVSS)
death  certificate  data  processing  were  accomplished  during  the  pandemic  (9).
Provisional death certificate data from NVSS, including decedents for whom COVID-19 is
listed as an underlying or a contributing cause of death, will be the primary data source
for  monitoring  COVID-19  mortality.  Among  several  mortality-based  metrics,  the
percentage of COVID-19–associated deaths among all reported deaths in NVSS will be a
new  weekly  surveillance  indicator  on  COVID  Data  Tracker  that  is  comparable  with  a
corresponding influenza mortality surveillance indicator (Table 2).** Because the lag in
mortality reporting is similar for COVID-19 deaths and deaths overall, this indicator is
not biased by incomplete reporting in previous weeks and allows for timely tracking of
mortality  trends  (8).  The  National  Syndromic  Surveillance  Program  (NSSP)  has
expanded substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, with data from 6,300 facilities
in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. NSSP includes 75% of all U.S. ED
visits  (Table  1);  coverage  is  currently  limited  in  Minnesota  and  Oklahoma,  and
discharge diagnosis completeness is currently limited in Missouri. Using NSSP discharge
diagnosis data, the weekly percentage of patients who receive a diagnosis of COVID-19
among  all  ED  visits  is  an  indicator  that  can  identify  trends  earlier  than  hospital
admission rates can (8). Monitoring national and regional trends in the percentage of
positive  SARS-CoV-2  nucleic  acid  amplification  test  (NAAT)  results  will  be  based  on
surveillance data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System
(NREVSS). This system is an established sentinel network of approximately 450 clinical,
public  health,  and  commercial  laboratories  that  voluntarily  submit  weekly  data  on
numbers of positive test results and total tests performed. As another early indicator,
the  percentage  of  positive  SARS-CoV-2  test  results  from  NREVSS  is  a  suitable
alternative  to  that  obtained  through  COVID-19  electronic  laboratory  reporting  (CELR),
which will not be possible after May 11, because reporting of negative rest results will
not  be  required  (8).  Because  SARS-CoV-2  testing  volumes  and  the  geographic
representation of NREVSS laboratories are heterogeneous (with one to 31 participating
laboratories  per  state),  region-level  rather  than  state-level  data  will  be  displayed.
Genomic  surveillance to  estimate SARS-CoV-2 variant proportions at the national  and
regional levels will continue with a biweekly cadence and revised analytic methods for
weighting  based  on  the  probability  of  selecting  positive  laboratory  specimens  for
sequencing (10). As fewer specimens and sequences become available, a system that
is scaled sufficiently to allow for regional estimates will be established in collaboration
with  the  network  of  public  health  laboratories  that  have  participated  in  the  National
SARS-CoV-2  Strain  Surveillance  program.††  The  National  Wastewater  Surveillance
System (NWSS) and Traveler-based Genomic Surveillance (TGS) Program are additional
sources of surveillance data for monitoring early trends in SARS-CoV-2 infections and
variant proportions (NWSS) and for early detection of new variants in travelers entering
the  United  States  (TGS)  that  will  continue  to  be  available  with  daily  or  weekly
updates.§§ In addition to NHSN, sentinel surveillance and large health care databases
will  continue  to  monitor  disease  severity  and  hospitalization-related  outcomes.  The
Coronavirus
 Disease
 2019–Associated
 Hospitalization
 Surveillance
 Network
(COVID-NET)¶¶  uses  active,  population-based  surveillance  to  estimate  rates  of
laboratory-confirmed  COVID-19–associated  hospital  admissions  and  also  collects
detailed  clinical  information,  including  underlying  conditions,  to  better  understand
trends  and  risk  for  severe  disease.  COVID-NET  currently  comprises  98  counties  in  13
states. In addition, three large databases of electronic health care records (BD Insights
Research  Database  [BD],  the  National  Patient-Centered  Clinical  Research  Network
[PCORnet], and Premier Healthcare Database’s Special COVID-19 Release [Premier])***
will  support  monitoring  of  COVID-19  severity  among  hospitalized  patients  (i.e.,
percentages  of  patients  in  intensive  care  units  [ICUs],  those  receiving  invasive
mechanical ventilation, and deaths). Monitoring vaccination coverage, safety,††† and VE
are ongoing priorities because COVID-19–associated hospitalizations and deaths can be
prevented through receipt of updated COVID-19 vaccines (1–3). Data use agreements
established at the start of the pandemic with states, territories, and selected cities to
facilitate  receipt  of  comprehensive  vaccine  administration  data  from  immunization
information  systems  will  terminate  at  the  end  of  the  public  health  emergency
declaration.  However,  most  jurisdictions  have  signed  data  use  agreement  extensions
and will continue to submit COVID-19 vaccination data. Although future data might not
be  as  complete  because  reporting  requirements  vary  by  state,  the  National
Immunization Survey Child and Adult COVID Modules will continue to provide data on
COVID-19 vaccination coverage and intent at the national and state levels via COVID
Data  Tracker  and  COVIDVaxView.§§§  VE  platforms  will  continue  to  provide  robust
assessment  of  the  real-world  performance  of  vaccines  (e.g.,  Investigating  Respiratory
Viruses  in  the  Acutely  Ill  [IVY]  and  VISION  Networks)  (1,2).  However,  strategies  for
evaluating  VE  will  need  to  incorporate  alternative  sources  of  vaccination  data  (e.g.,
patient/provider interviews or claims data) if immunization information systems are not
sufficiently complete. To continue facilitating access to national COVID-19 surveillance
data,  a  first-phase,  redesigned  COVID  Data  Tracker  website  will  launch  on  May  11,
2023.  These  data  will  continue  providing  an  evidence  base  of  information  to  guide
prioritization  of  public  health  action.  Numerous  surveillance  data  sources  and
corresponding  metrics  and  geographic  levels  will  be  updated  weekly  on  COVID  Data
Tracker, with visualizations of trends and maps (Table 2). County-level hospitalization
data will continue to include metrics on COVID-19–associated admissions and inpatient
and ICU bed occupancy. Metrics for COVID-19–associated deaths (state-level), ED visits
for  COVID-19  (state-level),  and  percentage  of  positive  SARS-CoV-2  test  results  (HHS
region-level) will also be displayed. Metric levels will be anchored to levels of hospital
admission  rates  used  in  the  CCLs  (8).  The  COVID  Data  Tracker  will  also  continue  to
display  SARS-CoV-2  variant  proportion  estimates  and  wastewater  and  traveler-based
genomic surveillance data, as well as vaccination data and health care data on disease
severity.  In  addition,  availability  of  priority  data  will  continue  after  May  11,  2023,  for
health  equity,  pediatric  and  special  populations  (e.g.,  vaccination  coverage  among
persons  who  are  pregnant  and  those  with  disabilities),  health  care  settings  (e.g.,
nursing home residents), and seroprevalence. SARS-CoV-2 infections remain nationally
notifiable, and line-level COVID-19 case surveillance data will continue to be available,
including public use data at https://data.cdc.gov. Top After the expiration of the public
health  emergency  on  May  11,  2023,  authorizations  to  collect  certain  types  of  public
health  data  expire  (Table  1).  The  COVID  Data  Tracker  includes  a  page  for  accessing
archived data.¶¶¶ HHS can no longer require reporting of negative SARS-CoV-2 testing
results  via  CELR  reporting.  This  change  removes  the  ability  to  monitor  the  national
percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 test results using the CELR data source. CELR data
served  as  a  useful  early  indicator  of  SARS-COV-2  transmission  during  the  pandemic.
However,  since  a  peak  of  approximately  17.4  million  NAATs  performed  weekly  in
January  2022,  coinciding  with  the  SARS-CoV-2  Omicron  variant  surge,  the  reported
weekly volume of NAATs performed declined to less than 1 million by April 26, 2023.
This  decline  is  related  in  part  to  increased  use  of  antigen  tests  as  well  as  at-home
testing.****  The  CELR  data  have  become  more  variable  in  quality  or  altogether
unavailable in many jurisdictions over time. CDC’s COVID-19 Community Transmission
Levels, which were derived, in part, from CELR data, also will be discontinued. National
reporting of aggregate weekly counts of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths, which
CDC  compiles  using  automated  data  extraction  from  jurisdictional  websites  and
dashboards and direct submissions, will also be discontinued with the expiration of the
public health emergency. This transition is consistent with many state and local health
authorities’ decisions to discontinue public reporting of these data. Aggregate counts of
COVID-19 cases have been useful for monitoring changing trends in incidence but have
become  less  representative  of  actual  rates  of  SARS-CoV-2  infections  or  levels  of
transmission  over  time,  related  to  decreased  laboratory  testing,  increased  home
testing,  changes  in  reporting  practices,  and  asymptomatic  infections.  Early  in  the
pandemic,  aggregate  reporting  from  health  departments  provided  more  up-to-date
counts  of  total  deaths  than  did  NVSS,  but  the  timeliness  of  NVSS  is  now  comparable
with that of the aggregate counts (8,9). As part of the shift from reporting of aggregate
death  count  data  to  use  of  NVSS  data,  date  of  death  will  be  used  rather  than  report
date. CCLs are based on a composite metric that includes COVID-19 hospital admission
rates, inpatient bed utilization among patients with COVID-19, and case rates derived
from  aggregate  reporting  of  case  counts  by  jurisdictions.  Because  aggregate  weekly
case counts will end, CCLs also will end on May 11, 2023. Hospital admissions levels
from  NHSN  closely  align  with  CCLs  (8)  and  will  replace  the  CCL  metric.  Monthly
reporting of case, hospitalization, and mortality rates by vaccination status will end with
the  expiration  of  the  public  health  emergency.  Top  Beginning  in  2020,  the  historic
response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  necessitated  rapid  improvements  in  processing,
reporting, and visualizing of timely and granular public health surveillance data on an
unprecedented scale. In 2023, as part of the transition of COVID-19 from emergency to
routine  public  health  program  activities,  CDC  has  established  the  Coronavirus  and
Other Respiratory Viruses Division,†††† which is committed to working with state, tribal,
local,  territorial,  federal,  and  other  partners  on  the  prevention  of  COVID-19  within  a
sustainable  and  integrated  surveillance  strategy  that  monitors  other  circulating
respiratory  viruses  and  prevention  measures,  including  vaccination,  to  provide  timely
and comprehensive situational awareness. In the past year, CDC has developed several
public  dashboards  displaying  data  on  hospitalizations  or  ED  visits  for  diagnosed  or
laboratory-confirmed
 COVID-19,
 influenza,
 and
 respiratory
 syncytial
 virus.§§§§
Monitoring  the  impact  of  COVID-19  and  the  effectiveness  of  prevention  and  control
strategies  continues  to  be  a  public  health  priority  during  the  transition  from  the
emergency  phase  of  the  COVID-19  response  to  routine  public  health  practice.
Approximately 1,000 COVID-19–associated weekly deaths were reported in early April
2023; COVID-19–associated deaths are largely preventable through receipt of updated
COVID-19  vaccine  and  timely  administration  of  therapeutics¶¶¶¶  (1–4).  Top  Lincoln
