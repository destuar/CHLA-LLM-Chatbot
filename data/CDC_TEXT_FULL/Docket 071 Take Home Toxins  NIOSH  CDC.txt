enacted  on  October  26,  1992,  as  section  209  of  Public  Law  102-522,  the  “Fire
Administration  Authorization  Act  of  1992.”  The  purpose  of  the  Act  is  to  protect  the
health  of  workers  and  their  families  from  hazardous  chemicals  and  substances,
including infectious agents, transported from the workplace to the home. Under the Act,
NIOSH was mandated to conduct a study to evaluate the problem of contamination of
workers’  homes  by  hazardous  chemicals  and  substances  transported  from  the
workplace.  Therefore,  NIOSH  requested  information  on  the  contamination  of  workers’
home  by  hazardous  chemicals  and  substances  transported  from  the  workplace  on
equipment, clothing, or the worker’s person. Congressional Record – Senate S 1594 –
