of the Director  Executive Summary  This document updates and replaces all previously
published
 guidelines for
the prevention of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in
 health-care
facilities. The purpose of this revision is to emphasize the
 importance of a)
the hierarchy of control measures, including administrative and
 engineering
controls and personal respiratory protection; b) the use of risk
 assessments
for developing a written tuberculosis (TB) control plan; c) early
 identifi-
cation and management of persons who have TB; d) TB screening
 programs for
health-care workers (HCWs); e) HCW training and education; and f)
 the
evaluation  of  TB  infection-control  programs.   Transmission  of  M.  tuberculosis  is  a
recognized risk to patients
 and HCWs in
health-care facilities. Transmission is most likely to occur from
 patients
who have unrecognized pulmonary or laryngeal TB, are not on
 effective anti-TB
therapy, and have not been placed in TB isolation. Several recent
 TB
outbreaks in health-care facilities, including outbreaks of
 multidrug-
resistant TB, have heightened concern about nosocomial
 transmission. Patients
who have multidrug-resistant TB can remain infectious for prolonged
 periods,
which increases the risk for nosocomial and/or occupational
 transmission of
M. tuberculosis. Increases in the incidence of TB have been
 observed in some
geographic areas; these increases are related partially to the high
 risk for
TB among immunosuppressed persons, particularly those infected with
 human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Transmission of M. tuberculosis to
 HIV-infected
persons is of particular concern because these persons are at high
 risk for
developing active TB if they become infected with the bacteria.
 Thus, health-
care facilities should be particularly alert to the need for
 preventing
transmission of M. tuberculosis in settings in which HIV-infected
 persons
work or receive care.  Supervisory responsibility for the TB infection-control program
 should be
assigned to a designated person or group of persons who should be
 given the
authority to implement and enforce TB infection-control policies.
 An
effective TB infection-control program requires early
 identification,
isolation, and treatment of persons who have active TB. The primary
 emphasis
of TB infection-control plans in health-care facilities should be
 achieving
these three goals by the application of a hierarchy of control
 measures,
including a) the use of administrative measures to reduce the risk
 for
exposure to persons who have infectious TB, b) the use of
 engineering
controls to prevent the spread and reduce the concentration of
 infectious
droplet nuclei, and c) the use of personal respiratory protective
 equipment
in areas where there is still a risk for exposure to M.
 tuberculosis (e.g.,
TB isolation rooms). Implementation of a TB infection-control
 program
requires risk assessment and development of a TB infection-control
 plan;
early identification, treatment, and isolation of infectious TB
 patients;
effective engineering controls; an appropriate respiratory
 protection
program; HCW TB training, education, counseling, and screening; and
evaluation of the program's effectiveness.  Although completely eliminating the risk for
transmission of M.
 tuberculosis
in all health-care facilities may not be possible at the present
 time,
adherence to these guidelines should reduce the risk to persons in
 these
settings. Recently, nosocomial TB outbreaks have demonstrated the
 substantial
morbidity and mortality among patients and HCWs that have been
 associated
with incomplete implementation of CDC's Guidelines for Preventing
 the
Transmission of Tuberculosis in Health-Care Facilities, with
 Special Focus on
HIV-Related Issues published in 1990. * Follow-up investigations at
 some of
these hospitals have documented that complete implementation of
 measures
similar or identical to those in the 1990 TB Guidelines
 significantly reduced
or eliminated nosocomial transmission of M. tuberculosis to
 patients and/or
HCWs.  
    Introduction  
        Purpose of Document  In April 1992, the National MDR-TB Task Force published the
 National
        Action Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (1).
 The
        publication was a response to reported nosocomial outbreaks
 of
        tuberculosis (TB), including outbreaks of
 multidrug-resistant TB
        (MDR-TB), and the increasing incidence of TB in some
 geographic
        areas. The plan called for the update and revision of the
 guidelines
        for preventing nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium
 tuberculosis
        published December 7, 1990 (2).  Public meetings were held in October 1992 and
January 1993
 to discuss
        revision of the 1990 TB Guidelines (2). CDC received
 considerable
        input on various aspects of infection control, including
 health-care
        worker (HCW) education; administrative controls (e.g.,
 having
        protocols for the early identification and management of
 patients who
        have TB); the need for more specific recommendations
 regarding
        ventilation; and clarification on the use of respiratory
 protection
        in health-care settings. On the basis of these events and
 the input
        received, on October 12, 1993, CDC published in the Federal
 Register
        the Draft Guidelines For Preventing the Transmission of
 Tuberculosis
        in Health-Care Facilities, Second Edition (3). During and
 after the
        90-day comment period following publication of this draft,
 CDC's TB
        Infection-Control Guidelines Work Group received and
 reviewed more
        than  2,500  comments.   The  purpose  of  this  document  is  to  make
recommendations for
 reducing
        the risk for transmitting M. tuberculosis to HCWs,
 patients,
        volunteers, visitors, and other persons in these settings.
 The
        information also may serve as a useful resource for
 educating HCWs
        about TB.  These recommendations update and replace all previously
 published CDC
        recommendations for TB infection control in health-care
 facilities
        (2,4). The recommendations in this document are applicable
 primarily
        to inpatient facilities in which health care is provided
 (e.g.,
        hospitals, medical wards in correctional facilities,
 nursing homes,
        and hospices). Recommendations applicable to
 ambulatory-care
        facilities, emergency departments, home-health-care
 settings,
        emergency medical services, medical offices, dental
 settings, and
        other facilities or residential settings that provide
 medical care
        are provided in separate sections, with cross-references to
 other
        sections of the guidelines if appropriate.  Designated personnel at health-care
facilities should
 conduct a risk
        assessment for the entire facility and for each area ** and
 occupa-
        tional group, determine the risk for nosocomial or
 occupational
        transmission of M. tuberculosis, and implement an
 appropriate TB
        infection-control program. The extent of the TB
 infection-control
        program may range from a simple program emphasizing
 administrative
        controls in settings where there is minimal risk for
 exposure to M.
        tuberculosis, to a comprehensive program that includes
 administrative
        controls, engineering controls, and respiratory protection
 in
        settings where the risk for exposure is high. In all
 settings,
        administrative measures should be used to minimize the
 number of HCWs
        exposed to M. tuberculosis while still providing optimal
 care for TB
        patients. HCWs providing care to patients who have TB
 should be
        informed about the level of risk for transmission of M.
 tuberculosis
        and the appropriate control measures to minimize that risk.
  In this document, the term "HCWs" refers to all the paid
 and unpaid
        persons working in health-care settings who have the
 potential for
        exposure to M. tuberculosis. This may include, but is not
 limited to,
        physicians; nurses; aides; dental workers; technicians;
 workers in
        laboratories and morgues; emergency medical service (EMS)
 personnel;
        students; part-time personnel; temporary staff not employed
 by the
        health-care facility; and persons not involved directly in
 patient
        care but who are potentially at risk for occupational
 exposure to M.
        tuberculosis (e.g., volunteer workers and dietary,
 housekeeping,
        maintenance, clerical, and janitorial staff).  Although the purpose of this document
is to make
 recommendations for
        reducing the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis in
 health-care
        facilities, the process of implementing these
 recommendations must
        safeguard, in accordance with applicable state and federal
 laws, the
        confidentiality and civil rights of persons who have TB.  
        Epidemiology, Transmission, and Pathogenesis of TB  The prevalence of TB is not
distributed evenly throughout
 all
        segments of the U.S. population. Some subgroups or persons
 have a
        higher risk for TB either because they are more likely than
 other
        persons in the general population to have been exposed to
 and
        infected with M. tuberculosis or because their infection is
 more
        likely to progress to active TB after they have been
 infected (5). In
        some cases, both of these factors may be present. Groups of
 persons
        known to have a higher prevalence of TB infection include
 contacts of
        persons who have active TB, foreign-born persons from areas
 of the
        world with a high prevalence of TB (e.g., Asia, Africa, the
        Caribbean, and Latin America), medically underserved
 populations
        (e.g., some African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and
 Pacific
        Islanders, American Indians, and Alaskan Natives), homeless
 persons,
        current or former correctional-facility inmates,
 alcoholics,
        injecting-drug users, and the elderly. Groups with a higher
 risk for
        progression from latent TB infection to active disease
 include
        persons who have been infected recently (i.e., within the
 previous 2
        years), children less than 4 years of age, persons with
 fibrotic
        lesions on chest radiographs, and persons with certain
 medical
        conditions (i.e., human immunodeficiency virus {HIV}
 infection,
        silicosis, gastrectomy or jejuno-ileal bypass, being
 greater than or
        equal to 10% below ideal body weight, chronic renal failure
 with
        renal dialysis, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression
 resulting from
        receipt of high-dose corticosteroid or other
 immunosuppressive
        therapy,  and  some  malignancies)  (5).   M.  tuberculosis  is  carried  in  airborne
particles, or
 droplet nuclei,
        that can be generated when persons who have pulmonary or
 laryngeal TB
        sneeze, cough, speak, or sing (6). The particles are an
 estimated 1-5
        um in size, and normal air currents can keep them airborne
 for
        prolonged time periods and spread them throughout a room or
 building
        (7). Infection occurs when a susceptible person inhales
 droplet
        nuclei containing M. tuberculosis, and these droplet nuclei
 traverse
        the mouth or nasal passages, upper respiratory tract, and
 bronchi to
        reach the alveoli of the lungs. Once in the alveoli, the
 organisms
        are taken up by alveolar macrophages and spread throughout
 the body.
        Usually within 2-10 weeks after initial infection with M.
 tubercu-
        losis, the immune response limits further multiplication
 and spread
        of the tubercle bacilli; however, some of the bacilli
 remain dormant
        and viable for many years. This condition is referred to as
 latent TB
        infection. Persons with latent TB infection usually have
 positive
        purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin-test
 results, but
        they do not have symptoms of active TB, and they are not
 infectious.  In general, persons who become infected with M.
 tuberculosis have
        approximately a 10% risk for developing active TB during
 their
        lifetimes. This risk is greatest during the first 2 years
 after
        infection. Immunocompromised persons have a greater risk
 for the
        progression of latent TB infection to active TB disease;
 HIV
        infection is the strongest known risk factor for this
 progression.
        Persons with latent TB infection who become coinfected with
 HIV have
        approximately an 8%-10% risk per year for developing active
 TB (8).
        HIV-infected persons who are already severely
 immunosuppressed and
        who become newly infected with M. tuberculosis have an even
 greater
        risk for developing active TB (9-12).  The probability that a person who is exposed
to M.
 tuberculosis will
        become infected depends primarily on the concentration of
 infectious
        droplet nuclei in the air and the duration of exposure.
 Character-
        istics of the TB patient that enhance transmission include
 a) disease
        in the lungs, airways, or larynx; b) presence of cough or
 other
        forceful expiratory measures; c) presence of acid-fast
 bacilli (AFB)
        in the sputum; d) failure of the patient to cover the mouth
 and nose
        when coughing or sneezing; e) presence of cavitation on
 chest
        radiograph; f) inappropriate or short duration of
 chemotherapy; and
        g) administration of procedures that can induce coughing or
 cause
        aerosolization of M. tuberculosis (e.g., sputum induction).
 Environ-
        mental factors that enhance the likelihood of transmission
 include a)
        exposure in relatively small, enclosed spaces; b)
 inadequate local or
        general ventilation that results in insufficient dilution
 and/or
        removal of infectious droplet nuclei; and c) recirculation
 of air
        containing infectious droplet nuclei. Characteristics of
 the persons
        exposed to M. tuberculosis that may affect the risk for
 becoming
        infected are not as well defined. In general, persons who
 have been
        infected previously with M. tuberculosis may be less
 susceptible to
        subsequent infection. However, reinfection can occur among
 previously
        infected persons, especially if they are severely
 immunocompromised.
        Vaccination with Bacille of Calmette and Guerin (BCG)
 probably does
        not affect the risk for infection; rather, it decreases the
 risk for
        progressing from latent TB infection to active TB (13).
 Finally,
        although it is well established that HIV infection
 increases the
        likelihood of progressing from latent TB infection to
 active TB, it
        is unknown whether HIV infection increases the risk for
 becoming
        infected if exposed to M. tuberculosis.  
        Risk  for  Nosocomial  Transmission  of  M.  tuberculosis   Transmission  of  M.
tuberculosis is a recognized risk in
 health-care
        facilities (14-22). The magnitude of the risk varies
 considerably by
        the type of health-care facility, the prevalence of TB in
 the
        community, the patient population served, the HCW's
 occupational
        group, the area of the health-care facility in which the
 HCW works,
        and the effectiveness of TB infection-control
 interventions. The risk
        may be higher in areas where patients with TB are provided
 care
        before diagnosis and initiation of TB treatment and
 isolation
        precautions (e.g., in clinic waiting areas and emergency
 departments)
        or where diagnostic or treatment procedures that stimulate
 coughing
        are performed. Nosocomial transmission of M. tuberculosis
 has been
        associated with close contact with persons who have
 infectious TB and
        with the performance of certain procedures (e.g.,
 bronchoscopy {17},
        endotracheal intubation and suctioning {18}, open abscess
 irrigation
        {20}, and autopsy {21,22}). Sputum induction and aerosol
 treatments
        that induce coughing may also increase the potential for
 transmission
        of M. tuberculosis (23,24). Personnel of health-care
 facilities
        should be particularly alert to the need for preventing
 transmission
        of M. tuberculosis in those facilities in which
 immunocompromised
        persons (e.g., HIV-infected persons) work or receive care
 --
        especially if cough-inducing procedures, such as sputum
 induction and
        aerosolized pentamidine treatments, are being performed.  Several TB outbreaks
among persons in health-care
 facilities have
        been reported recently (11,24-28; CDC, unpublished data).
 Many of
        these outbreaks involved transmission of
 multidrug-resistant strains
        of M. tuberculosis to both patients and HCWs. Most of the
 patients
        and some of the HCWs were HIV-infected persons in whom new
 infection
        progressed rapidly to active disease. Mortality associated
 with those
        outbreaks was high (range: 43%-93%). Furthermore, the
 interval
        between diagnosis and death was brief (range of median
 intervals:
        4-16 weeks). Factors contributing to these outbreaks
 included delayed
        diagnosis of TB, delayed recognition of drug resistance,
 and delayed
        initiation of effective therapy -- all of which resulted in
 prolonged
        infectiousness, delayed initiation and inadequate duration
 of TB
        isolation, inadequate ventilation in TB isolation rooms,
 lapses in TB
        isolation practices and inadequate precautions for
 cough-inducing
        procedures, and lack of adequate respiratory protection.
 Analysis of
        data collected from three of the health-care facilities
 involved in
        the outbreaks indicates that transmission of M.
 tuberculosis
        decreased significantly or ceased entirely in areas where
 measures
        similar to those in the 1990 TB Guidelines were implemented
 (2,29-
        32). However, several interventions were implemented
 simultaneously,
        and the effectiveness of the separate interventions could
 not be
        determined.  
        Fundamentals of TB Infection Control  An effective TB infection-control program
requires early
 identifi-
        cation, isolation, and effective treatment of persons who
 have active
        TB. The primary emphasis of the TB infection-control plan
 should be
        on achieving these three goals. In all health-care
 facilities,
        particularly those in which persons who are at high risk
 for TB work
        or receive care, policies and procedures for TB control
 should be
        developed, reviewed periodically, and evaluated for
 effectiveness to
        determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for
 transmission
        of M. tuberculosis.  The TB infection-control program should be based on a
 hierarchy of
        control measures. The first level of the hierarchy, and
 that which
        affects the largest number of persons, is using
 administrative
        measures intended primarily to reduce the risk for exposing
        uninfected persons to persons who have infectious TB. These
 measures
        include a) developing and implementing effective written
 policies and
        protocols to ensure the rapid identification, isolation,
 diagnostic
        evaluation, and treatment of persons likely to have TB; b)
 imple-
        menting effective work practices among HCWs in the
 health-care
        facility (e.g., correctly wearing respiratory protection
 and keeping
        doors to isolation rooms closed); c) educating, training,
 and
        counseling HCWs about TB; and d) screening HCWs for TB
 infection and
        disease.  The second level of the hierarchy is the use of engineering
 controls
        to prevent the spread and reduce the concentration of
 infectious
        droplet nuclei. These controls include a) direct source
 control using
        local exhaust ventilation, b) controlling direction of
 airflow to
        prevent contamination of air in areas adjacent to the
 infectious
        source, c) diluting and removing contaminated air via
 general
        ventilation, and d) air cleaning via air filtration or
 ultraviolet
        germicidal irradiation (UVGI).  The first two levels of the hierarchy minimize the
number
 of areas in
        the health-care facility where exposure to infectious TB
 may occur,
        and they reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk in those
 few areas
        where exposure to M. tuberculosis can still occur (e.g.,
 rooms in
        which patients with known or suspected infectious TB are
 being
        isolated and treatment rooms in which cough-inducing or
 aerosol-
        generating procedures are performed on such patients).
 Because
        persons entering such rooms may be exposed to M.
 tuberculosis, the
        third level of the hierarchy is the use of personal
 respiratory
        protective equipment in these and certain other situations
 in which
        the risk for infection with M. tuberculosis may be
 relatively higher.  Specific measures to reduce the risk for transmission of M.
 tubercu-
        losis include the following:  
            Assigning to specific persons in the health-care
 facility the
            supervisory responsibility for designing, implementing,
            evaluating, and maintaining the TB infection-control
 program
            (Section II.A).  
            Conducting a risk assessment to evaluate the risk for
 trans-
            mission of M. tuberculosis in all areas of the
 health-care
            facility, developing a written TB infection-control
 program based
            on the risk assessment, and periodically repeating the
 risk
            assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of the TB
 infection-
            control program (Section II.B).  
            Developing, implementing, and enforcing policies and
 protocols to
            ensure early identification, diagnostic evaluation, and
 effective
            treatment of patients who may have infectious TB
 (Section II.C;
            Suppl. 2).  
            Providing prompt triage for and appropriate management
 of
            patients in the outpatient setting who may have
 infectious TB
            (Section II.D).  
            Promptly initiating and maintaining TB isolation for
 persons who
            may have infectious TB and who are admitted to the
 inpatient
            setting (Section II.E; Suppl. 1).  
            Effectively planning arrangements for discharge
 (Section II.E).  
            Developing, installing, maintaining, and evaluating
 ventilation
            and other engineering controls to reduce the potential
 for
            airborne exposure to M. tuberculosis (Section II.F;
 Suppl. 3).  
            Developing, implementing, maintaining, and evaluating a
 respir-
            atory protection program (Section II.G; Suppl. 4).  
            Using precautions while performing cough-inducing
 procedures
            (Section II.H; Suppl. 3).  
            Educating and training HCWs about TB, effective methods
 for
            preventing transmission of M. tuberculosis, and the
 benefits of
            medical screening programs (Section II.I).  
            Developing and implementing a program for routine
 periodic
            counseling and screening of HCWs for active TB and
 latent TB
            infection (Section II.J; Suppl. 2).  
            Promptly evaluating possible episodes of M.
 tuberculosis
            transmission in health-care facilities, including PPD
 skin-test
            conversions among HCWs, epidemiologically associated
 cases among
            HCWs or patients, and contacts of patients or HCWs who
 have TB
            and who were not promptly identified and isolated
 (Section II.K).  
            Coordinating activities with the local public health
 department,
            emphasizing reporting, and ensuring adequate discharge
 follow-up
            and the continuation and completion of therapy (Section
 II.L).  
    Recommendations  
        Assignment of Responsibility  
            Supervisory responsibility for the TB infection-control
 program
            should be assigned to a designated person or group of
 persons
            with expertise in infection control, occupational
 health, and
            engineering. These persons should be given the
 authority to
            implement and enforce TB infection-control policies.  
            If supervisory responsibility is assigned to a
 committee, one
            person should be designated as the TB contact person.
 Questions
            and problems can then be addressed to this person.  
        Risk Assessment, Development of the TB Infection-Control
 Plan, and
        Periodic Reassessment  
            Risk assessment  
                General  
                    TB infection-control measures for each
 health-care
                    facility should be based on a careful
 assessment of the
                    risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis in
 that
                    particular setting. The first step in
 developing the TB
                    infection-control program should be to conduct
 a baseline
                    risk assessment to evaluate the risk for
 transmission of
                    M. tuberculosis in each area and occupational
 group in
                    the facility (Table_1, Figure_1
Figure_1a
Figure_1c). Appropriate infection-control
 inter-
                    ventions can then be developed on the basis of
 actual
                    risk. Risk assessments should be performed for
 all
                    inpatient and outpatient settings (e.g.,
 medical and
                    dental offices).  
                    Regardless of risk level, the management of
 patients with
                    known or suspected infectious TB should not
 vary.
                    However, the index of suspicion for infectious
 TB among
                    patients, the frequency of HCW PPD skin
 testing, the
                    number of TB isolation rooms, and other factors
 will
                    depend on whether the risk for transmission of
 M.
                    tuberculosis in the facility, area, or
 occupational group
                    is high, intermediate, low, very low, or
 minimal.  
                    The risk assessment should be conducted by a
 qualified
                    person or group of persons (e.g., hospital
 epidemi-
                    ologists, infectious disease specialists,
 pulmonary
                    disease specialists, infection-control
 practitioners,
                    health-care administrators, occupational health
                    personnel, engineers, HCWs, or local public
 health
                    personnel).  
                    The risk assessment should be conducted for the
 entire
                    facility and for specific areas within the
 facility
                    (e.g., medical, TB, pulmonary, or HIV wards;
 HIV,
                    infectious disease, or pulmonary clinics; and
 emergency
                    departments or other areas where TB patients
 might
                    receive care or where cough-inducing procedures
 are
                    performed). This should include both inpatient
 and
                    outpatient areas. In addition, risk assessments
 should be
                    conducted for groups of HCWs who work
 throughout the
                    facility rather than in a specific area (e.g.,
 respir-
                    atory therapists; bronchoscopists;
 environmental
                    services, dietary, and maintenance personnel;
 and
                    students, interns, residents, and fellows).  
                    Classification of risk for a facility, for a
 specific
                    area, and for a specific occupational group
 should be
                    based on a) the profile of TB in the community;
 b) the
                    number of infectious TB patients admitted to
 the area or
                    ward, or the estimated number of infectious TB
 patients
                    to whom HCWs in an occupational group may be
 exposed; and
                    c) the results of analysis of HCW PPD test
 conversions
                    (where applicable) and possible
 person-to-person
                    transmission of M. tuberculosis (Figure_1
Figure_1a Figure_1c).  
                    All TB infection-control programs should
 include periodic
                    reassessments of risk. The frequency of repeat
 risk
                    assessments should be based on the results of
 the most
                    recent risk assessment (Table_2,
 Figure_1
Figure_1a Figure_1c).  
                    The "minimal-risk" category applies only to an
 entire
                    facility. A "minimal-risk" facility does not
 admit TB
                    patients to inpatient or outpatient areas and
 is not
                    located in a community with TB (i.e., counties
 or
                    communities in which TB cases have not been
 reported
                    during the previous year). Thus, there is
 essentially no
                    risk for exposure to TB patients in the
 facility. This
                    category may also apply to many outpatient
 settings
                    (e.g., many medical and dental offices).  
                    The "very low-risk" category generally applies
 only to an
                    entire facility. A very low-risk facility is
 one in which  
                        patients with active TB are not admitted to
 inpatient
                        areas but may receive initial assessment and
 diagnostic
                        evaluation or outpatient management in
 outpatient areas
                        (e.g., ambulatory-care and emergency
 departments) and b)
                        patients who may have active TB and need
 inpatient care
                        are promptly referred to a collaborating
 facility. In
                        such facilities, the outpatient areas in which
 exposure
                        to patients with active TB could occur should
 be assessed
                        and assigned to the appropriate low-,
 intermediate-, or
                        high-risk category. Categorical assignment will
 depend on
                        the number of TB patients examined in the area
 during the
                        preceding year and whether there is evidence of
 noso-
                        comial transmission of M. tuberculosis in the
 area. If TB
                        cases have been reported in the community, but
 no
                        patients with active TB have been examined in
 the
                        outpatient area during the preceding year, the
 area can
                        be designated as very low risk (e.g., many
 medical
                        offices).  The referring and receiving facilities should
 establish
                        a referral agreement to prevent inappropriate
 management
                        and potential loss to follow-up of patients
 suspected of
                        having TB during evaluation in the triage
 system of a
                        very low-risk facility.  In some facilities in which TB patients are
 admitted to
                        inpatient areas, a very low-risk protocol may
 be appro-
                        priate for areas (e.g., administrative areas)
 or
                        occupational groups that have only a very
 remote
                        possibility of exposure to M. tuberculosis.  The very low-risk category
may also be
 appropriate for
                        outpatient facilities that do not provide
 initial
                        assessment of persons who may have TB, but do
 screen
                        patients for active TB as part of a limited
 medical
                        screening before undertaking specialty care
 (e.g., dental
                        settings).  
                    "Low-risk" areas or occupational groups are
 those in
                    which a) the PPD test conversion rate is not
 greater than
                    that for areas or groups in which occupational
 exposure
                    to M. tuberculosis is unlikely or than previous
                    conversion rates for the same area or group, b)
 no
                    clusters *** of PPD test conversions have
 occurred, c)
                    person-to-person transmission of M.
 tuberculosis has not
                    been detected, and d) fewer than six TB
 patients are
                    examined or treated per year.  
                    "Intermediate-risk" areas or occupational
 groups are
                    those in which a) the PPD test conversion rate
 is not
                    greater than that for areas or groups in which
 occupa-
                    tional exposure to M. tuberculosis is unlikely
 or than
                    previous conversion rates for the same area or
 group, b)
                    no clusters of PPD test conversions have
 occurred, c)
                    person-to-person transmission of M.
 tuberculosis has not
                    been detected, and d) six or more patients with
 active TB
                    are examined or treated each year. Survey data
 suggest
                    that facilities in which six or more TB
 patients are
                    examined or treated each year may have an
 increased risk
                    for transmission of M. tuberculosis (CDC,
 unpublished
                    data); thus, areas in which six or more
 patients with
                    active TB are examined or treated each year (or
 occupa-
                    tional groups in which HCWs are likely to be
 exposed to
                    six or more TB patients per year) should be
 classified as
                    "intermediate risk."  
                    "High-risk" areas or occupational groups are
 those in
                    which a) the PPD test conversion rate is
 significantly
                    greater than for areas or groups in which
 occupational
                    exposure to M. tuberculosis is unlikely or than
 previous
                    conversion rates for the same area or group,
 and epidemi-
                    ologic evaluation suggests nosocomial
 transmission; or b)
                    a cluster of PPD test conversions has occurred,
 and
                    epidemiologic evaluation suggests nosocomial
 transmission
                    of M. tuberculosis; or c) possible
 person-to-person
                    transmission of M. tuberculosis has been
 detected.  
                    If no data or insufficient data for adequate
 determin-
                    ation of risk have been collected, such data
 should be
                    compiled, analyzed, and reviewed expeditiously.
  
                Community TB profile  
                    A profile of TB in the community that is served
 by the
                    facility should be obtained from the public
 health
                    department. This profile should include, at a
 minimum,
                    the incidence (and prevalence, if available) of
 active TB
                    in the community and the drug-susceptibility
 patterns of
                    M. tuberculosis isolates (i.e., the
 antituberculous
                    agents to which each isolate is susceptible and
 those to
                    which it is resistant) from patients in the
 community.  
                Case surveillance  
                    Data concerning the number of suspected and
 confirmed
                    active TB cases among patients and HCWs in the
 facility
                    should be systematically collected, reviewed,
 and used to
                    estimate the number of TB isolation rooms
 needed, to
                    recognize possible clusters of nosocomial
 transmission,
                    and to assess the level of potential
 occupational risk.
                    The number of TB patients in specific areas of
 a facility
                    can be obtained from laboratory surveillance
 data on
                    specimens positive for AFB smears or M.
 tuberculosis
                    cultures, from infection-control records, and
 from
                    databases containing information about hospital
 discharge
                    diagnoses.  
                    Drug-susceptibility patterns of M. tuberculosis
 isolates
                    from TB patients treated in the facility should
 be
                    reviewed to identify the frequency and patterns
 of drug
                    resistance. This information may indicate a
 need to
                    modify the initial treatment regimen or may
 suggest
                    possible nosocomial transmission or increased
 occupa-
                    tional risk.  
                Analysis of HCW PPD test screening data  
                    Results of HCW PPD testing should be recorded
 in the
                    individual HCW's employee health record and in
 a
                    retrievable aggregate database of all HCW PPD
 test
                    results. Personal identifying information
 should be
                    handled confidentially. PPD test conversion
 rates should
                    be calculated at appropriate intervals to
 estimate the
                    risk for PPD test conversions for each area of
 the
                    facility and for each specific occupational
 group not
                    assigned to a specific area (Table_2). To
 calculate
                    PPD test conversion rates, the total number of
 previously
                    PPD-negative HCWs tested in each area or group
 (i.e., the
                    denominator) and the number of PPD test
 conversions among
                    HCWs in each area or group (the numerator) must
 be
                    obtained.  
                    PPD test conversion rates for each area or
 occupational
                    group should be compared with rates for areas
 or groups
                    in which occupational exposure to M.
 tuberculosis is
                    unlikely and with previous conversion rates in
 the same
                    area or group to identify areas or groups where
 the risk
                    for occupational PPD test conversions may be
 increased.
                    A low number of HCWs in a specific area may
 result in a
                    greatly increased rate of conversion for that
 area,
                    although the actual risk may not be
 significantly greater
                    than that for other areas. Testing for
 statistical
                    significance (e.g., Fisher's exact test or chi
 square
                    test) may assist interpretation; however, lack
 of
                    statistical significance may not rule out a
 problem
                    (i.e., if the number of HCWs tested is low,
 there may not
                    be adequate statistical power to detect a
 significant
                    difference). Thus, interpretation of individual
                    situations is necessary.  
                    An epidemiologic investigation to evaluate the
 likelihood
                    of nosocomial transmission should be conducted
 if PPD
                    test conversions are noted (Section II.K.1).  
                    The frequency and comprehensiveness of the HCW
 PPD
                    testing program should be evaluated
 periodically to
                    ensure that all HCWs who should be included in
 the
                    program are being tested at appropriate
 intervals. For
                    surveillance purposes, earlier detection of
 transmission
                    may be enhanced if HCWs in a given area or
 occupational
                    group are tested on different scheduled dates
 rather than
                    all being tested on the same date (Section
 II.J.3).  
                Review of TB patient medical records  
                    The medical records of a sample of TB patients
 examined
                    at the facility can be reviewed periodically to
 evaluate
                    infection-control parameters (Table_1).
 Parameters to
                    examine may include the intervals from date of
 admission
                    until a) TB was suspected, b) specimens for AFB
 smears
                    were ordered, c) these specimens were
 collected, d) tests
                    were performed, and e) results were reported.
 Moreover,
                    the adequacy of the TB treatment regimens that
 were used
                    should be evaluated.  
                    Medical record reviews should note previous
 hospital
                    admissions of TB patients before the onset of
 TB
                    symptoms. Patient-to-patient transmission may
 be
                    suspected if active TB occurs in a patient who
 had a
                    prior hospitalization during which exposure to
 another TB
                    patient occurred or if isolates from two or
 more TB
                    patients have identical characteristic
 drug-suscepti-
                    bility or DNA fingerprint patterns.  
                    Data from the case review should be used to
 determine if
                    there is a need to modify a) protocols for
 identifying
                    and isolating patients who may have infectious
 TB, b)
                    laboratory procedures, c) administrative
 policies and
                    practices, or d) protocols for patient
 management.  
                Observation of TB infection-control practices  
                    Assessing adherence to the policies of the TB
 infection-
                    control program should be part of the
 evaluation process.
                    This assessment should be performed on a
 regular basis
                    and whenever an increase occurs in the number
 of TB
                    patients or HCW PPD test conversions. Areas at
 high risk
                    for transmission of M. tuberculosis should be
 monitored
                    more frequently than other areas. The review of
 patient
                    medical records provides information on HCW
 adherence to
                    some of the policies of the TB
 infection-control program.
                    In addition, work practices related to TB
 isolation
                    (e.g., keeping doors to isolation rooms closed)
 should be
                    observed to determine if employers are
 enforcing, and
                    HCWs are adhering to, these policies and if
 patient
                    adherence is being enforced. If these policies
 are not
                    being enforced or adhered to, appropriate
 education and
                    other corrective action should be implemented.  
                Engineering evaluation  
                    Results of engineering maintenance measures
 should be
                    reviewed at regular intervals (Table_3).
 Data from
                    the most recent evaluation and from maintenance
                    procedures and logs should be reviewed
 carefully as part
                    of the risk assessment.  
            Development of the TB Infection-Control Plan  
                Based on the results of the risk assessment, a
 written TB
                infection-control plan should be developed and
 implemented
                for each area of the facility and for each
 occupational group
                of HCWs not assigned to a specific area of the
 facility
                (Table_2; Table_3).  
                The occurrence of drug-resistant TB in the facility
 or the
                community, or a relatively high prevalence of HIV
 infection
                among patients or HCWs in the community, may
 increase the
                concern about transmission of M. tuberculosis and
 may
                influence the decision regarding which protocol to
 follow
                (i.e., a higher-risk classification may be
 selected).  
                Health-care facilities are likely to have a
 combination of
                low-, intermediate-, and high-risk areas or
 occupational
                groups during the same time period. The appropriate
 protocol
                should be implemented for each area or group.  
                Areas in which cough-inducing procedures are
 performed on
                patients who may have active TB should, at the
 minimum,
                implement the intermediate-risk protocol.  
            Periodic Reassessment  
                Follow-up risk assessment should be performed at
 the interval
                indicated by the most recent risk assessment
 (Figure_1
Figure_1a Figure_1c; Table_2). Based on
 the
                results of the follow-up assessment, problem
 evaluation may
                need to be conducted or the protocol may need to be
 modified
                to a higher- or lower-risk level.  
                After each risk assessment, the staff responsible
 for TB
                control, in conjunction with other appropriate
 HCWs, should
                review all TB control policies to ensure that they
 are
                effective and meet current needs.  
            Examples of Risk Assessment  Examples of six hypothetical situations and the
means
 by which
            surveillance data are used to select a TB control
 protocol are
            described as follows:  Hospital A. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in
 the
            facility is 1.6%. No areas or HCW occupational groups
 have a
            significantly greater PPD test conversion rate than
 areas or
            groups in which occupational exposure to M.
 tuberculosis is
            unlikely (or than previous rates for the same area or
 group). No
            clusters of PPD test conversions have occurred.
 Patient-to-
            patient transmission has not been detected. Patients
 who have TB
            are admitted to the facility, but no area admits six or
 more TB
            patients per year. The low-risk protocol will be
 followed in all
            areas.  Hospital B. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in
 the
            facility is 1.8%. The PPD test conversion rate for the
 medical
            intensive-care unit rate is significantly higher than
 all other
            areas in the facility. The problem identification
 process is
            initiated (Section II.K). It is determined that all TB
 patients
            have been isolated appropriately. Other potential
 problems are
            then evaluated, and the cause for the higher rate is
 not
            identified. After consulting the public health
 department TB
            infection-control program, the high-risk protocol is
 followed in
            the unit until the PPD test conversion rate is similar
 to areas
            of the facility in which occupational exposure to TB
 patients is
            unlikely. If the rate remains significantly higher than
 other
            areas, further evaluation, including environmental and
 procedural
            studies, will be performed to identify possible reasons
 for the
            high conversion rate.  Hospital C. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in
 the
            facility is 2.4%. Rates range from 0 to 2.6% for the
 individual
            areas and occupational groups. None of these rates is
 signifi-
            cantly higher than rates for areas in which
 occupational exposure
            to M. tuberculosis is unlikely. No particular HCW group
 has
            higher conversion rates than the other groups. No
 clusters of HCW
            PPD test conversions have occurred. In two of the
 areas, HCWs
            cared for more than six TB patients during the
 preceding year.
            These two areas will follow the intermediate-risk
 protocol, and
            all other areas will follow the low-risk protocol. This
 hospital
            is located in the southeastern United States, and these
            conversion rates may reflect cross-reactivity with
 nontuberculous
            mycobacteria.  Hospital D. The overall HCW PPD test conversion rate in
 the
            facility is 1.2%. In no area did HCWs care for six or
 more TB
            patients during the preceding year. Three of the 20
 respiratory
            therapists tested had PPD conversions, for a rate of
 15%. The
            respiratory therapists who had PPD test conversions had
 spent all
            or part of their time in the pulmonary function
 laboratory, where
            induced sputum specimens were obtained. A low-risk
 protocol is
            maintained for all areas and occupational groups in the
 facility
            except for respiratory therapists. A problem evaluation
 is
            conducted in the pulmonary function laboratory (Section
 II.K). It
            is determined that the ventilation in this area is
 inadequate.
            Booths are installed for sputum induction. PPD testing
 and the
            risk assessment are repeated 3 months later. If the
 repeat
            testing at 3 months indicates that no more conversions
 have
            occurred, the respiratory therapists will return to the
 low-risk
            protocol.  Hospital E. Hospital E is located in a community that
 has a
            relatively low incidence of TB. To optimize TB services
 in the
            community, the four hospitals in the community have
 developed an
            agreement that one of them (e.g., Hospital G) will
 provide all
            inpatient services to persons who have suspected or
 confirmed TB.
            The other hospitals have implemented protocols in their
            ambulatory-care clinics and emergency departments to
 identify
            patients who may have active TB. These patients are
 then
            transferred to Hospital G for inpatient care if such
 care is
            considered necessary. After discharge from Hospital G,
 they
            receive follow-up care in the public health
 department's TB
            clinic. During the preceding year, Hospital E has
 identified
            fewer than six TB patients in its ambulatory-care and
 emergency
            departments and has had no PPD test conversions or
 other evidence
            of M. tuberculosis transmission among HCWs or patients
 in these
            areas. These areas are classified as low risk, and all
 other
            areas are classified as very low risk.  Hospital F. Hospital F is located in a county
in which
 no TB
            cases have been reported during the preceding 2 years.
 A risk
            assessment conducted at the facility did not identify
 any
            patients who had suspected or confirmed TB during the
 preceding
            year. The facility is classified as minimal risk.  
        Identifying, Evaluating, and Initiating Treatment for
 Patients Who
        May Have Active TB  The most important factors in preventing transmission of M.
 tuber-
        culosis are the early identification of patients who may
 have
        infectious TB, prompt implementation of TB precautions for
 such
        patients, and prompt initiation of effective treatment for
 those who
        are likely to have TB.  
            Identifying patients who may have active TB  
                Health-care personnel who are assigned
 responsibility for TB
                infection control in ambulatory-care and inpatient
 settings
                should develop, implement, and enforce protocols
 for the
                early identification of patients who may have
 infectious TB.  
                The criteria used in these protocols should be
 based on the
                prevalence and characteristics of TB in the
 population served
                by the specific facility. These protocols should be
 evaluated
                periodically and revised according to the results
 of the
                evaluation. Review of medical records of patients
 who were
                examined in the facility and diagnosed as having TB
 may serve
                as a guide for developing or revising these
 protocols.  
                A diagnosis of TB may be considered for any patient
 who has
                a persistent cough (i.e., a cough lasting for
 greater than or
                equal to 3 weeks) or other signs or symptoms
 compatible with
                active TB (e.g., bloody sputum, night sweats,
 weight loss,
                anorexia, or fever). However, the index of
 suspicion for TB
                will vary in different geographic areas and will
 depend on
                the prevalence of TB and other characteristics of
 the
                population served by the facility. The index of
 suspicion for
                TB should be very high in geographic areas or among
 groups of
                patients in which the prevalence of TB is high
 (Section I.B).
                Appropriate diagnostic measures should be conducted
 and TB
                precautions implemented for patients in whom active
 TB is
                suspected.  
            Diagnostic evaluation for active TB  
                Diagnostic measures for identifying TB should be
 conducted
                for patients in whom active TB is being considered.
 These
                measures include obtaining a medical history and
 performing
                a physical examination, PPD skin test, chest
 radiograph, and
                microscopic examination and culture of sputum or
 other
                appropriate specimens (6,34,35). Other diagnostic
 procedures
                (e.g., bronchoscopy or biopsy) may be indicated for
 some
                patients (36,37).  
                Prompt laboratory results are crucial to the proper
 treatment
                of the TB patient and to early initiation of
 infection
                control. To ensure timely results, laboratories
 performing
                mycobacteriologic tests should be proficient at
 both the
                laboratory and administrative aspects of specimen
 processing.
                Laboratories should use the most rapid methods
 available
                (e.g., fluorescent microscopy for AFB smears;
 radiometric
                culture methods for isolation of mycobacteria;
 r-nitro-a-
                acetylamino-b-hydroxy-proprophenone {NAP} test,
 nucleic acid
                probes, or high-pressure liquid chromatography
 {HPLC} for
                species identification; and radiometric methods for
 drug-
                susceptibility testing). As other more rapid or
 sensitive
                tests become available, practical, and affordable,
 such tests
                should be incorporated promptly into the
 mycobacteriology
                laboratory. Laboratories that rarely receive
 specimens for
                mycobacteriologic analysis should refer the
 specimens to a
                laboratory that more frequently performs these
 tests.  
                Results of AFB sputum smears should be available
 within 24
                hours of specimen collection (38).  
                The probability of TB is greater among patients who
 have
                positive PPD test results or a history of positive
 PPD test
                results, who have previously had TB or have been
 exposed to
                M. tuberculosis, or who belong to a group at high
 risk for TB
                (Section I.B). Active TB is strongly suggested if
 the
                diagnostic evaluation reveals AFB in sputum, a
 chest
                radiograph suggestive of TB, or symptoms highly
 suggestive of
                TB. TB can occur simultaneously in immunosuppressed
 persons
                who have pulmonary infections caused by other
 organisms
                (e.g., Pneumocystis carinii or Mycobacterium avium
 complex)
                and should be considered in the diagnostic
 evaluation of all
                patients who have symptoms compatible with TB
 (Suppl. 1;
                Suppl. 2).  
                TB may be more difficult to diagnose among persons
 who have
                HIV infection (or other conditions associated with
 severe
                suppression of cell-mediated immunity) because of a
                nonclassical clinical or radiographic presentation
 and/or the
                simultaneous occurrence of other pulmonary
 infections (e.g.,
                P. carinii pneumonia and M. avium complex). The
 difficulty in
                diagnosing TB in HIV-infected persons may be
 further
                compounded by impaired responses to PPD skin tests
 (39,40),
                the possibly lower sensitivity of sputum smears for
 detecting
                AFB (41), or the overgrowth of cultures with M.
 avium complex
                in specimens from patients infected with both M.
 avium
                complex and M. tuberculosis (42).  
                Immunosuppressed patients who have pulmonary signs
 or
                symptoms that are ascribed initially to infections
 or
                conditions other than TB should be evaluated
 initially for
                coexisting TB. The evaluation for TB should be
 repeated if
                the patient does not respond to appropriate therapy
 for the
                presumed cause(s) of the pulmonary abnormalities
 (Suppl. 1;
                Suppl. 2).  
                Patients with suspected or confirmed TB should be
 reported
                immediately to the appropriate public health
 department so
                that standard procedures for identifying and
 evaluating TB
                contacts can be initiated.  
            Initiation of treatment for suspected or confirmed TB  
                Patients who have confirmed active TB or who are
 considered
                highly likely to have active TB should be started
 promptly on
                appropriate treatment in accordance with current
 guidelines
                (Suppl. 2) (43). In geographic areas or facilities
 that have
                a high prevalence of MDR-TB, the initial regimen
 used may
                need to be enhanced while the results of
 drug-susceptibility
                tests are pending. The decision should be based on
 analysis
                of surveillance data.  
                While the patient is in the health-care facility,
 anti-TB
                drugs should be administered by directly observed
 therapy
                (DOT), the process by which an HCW observes the
 patient
                swallowing the medications. Continuing DOT after
 the patient
                is discharged should be strongly considered. This
 decision
                and the arrangements for providing outpatient DOT
 should be
                made in collaboration with the public health
 department.  
        Management of Patients Who May Have Active TB in
 Ambulatory-Care
        Settings and Emergency Departments  
            Triage of patients in ambulatory-care settings and
 emergency
            departments should include vigorous efforts to promptly
 identify
            patients who have active TB. HCWs who are the first
 points of
            contact in facilities that serve populations at risk
 for TB
            should be trained to ask questions that will facilitate
 identi-
            fication of patients with signs and symptoms suggestive
 of TB.  
            Patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of TB should
 be
            evaluated promptly to minimize the amount of time they
 are in
            ambulatory-care areas. TB precautions should be
 followed while
            the diagnostic evaluation is being conducted for these
 patients.  
            TB precautions in the ambulatory-care setting should
 include a)
            placing these patients in a separate area apart from
 other
            patients, and not in open waiting areas (ideally, in a
 room or
            enclosure meeting TB isolation requirements); b) giving
 these
            patients surgical masks **** to wear and instructing
 them to keep
            their masks on; and c) giving these patients tissues
 and
            instructing them to cover their mouths and noses with
 the tissues
            when coughing or sneezing.  
            TB precautions should be followed for patients who are
 known to
            have active TB and who have not completed therapy until
 a
            determination has been made that they are noninfectious
 (Suppl.
            1).  
            Patients with active TB who need to attend a
 health-care clinic
            should have appointments scheduled to avoid exposing
 HIV-infected
            or otherwise severely immunocompromised persons to M.
 tubercu-
            losis. This recommendation could be accomplished by
 designating
            certain times of the day for appointments for these
 patients or
            by treating them in areas where immunocompromised
 persons are not
            treated.  
            Ventilation in ambulatory-care areas where patients at
 high risk
            for TB are treated should be designed and maintained to
 reduce
            the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis.
 General-use areas
            (e.g., waiting rooms) and special areas (e.g.,
 treatment or TB
            isolation rooms in ambulatory areas) should be
 ventilated in the
            same manner as described for similar inpatient areas
 (Sections
            II.E.3, II.F; Suppl. 3). Enhanced general ventilation
 or the use
            of air-disinfection techniques (e.g., UVGI or
 recirculation of
            air within the room through high-efficiency particulate
 air
            {HEPA} filters) may be useful in general-use areas of
 facilities
            where many infectious TB patients receive care (Section
 II.F;
            Suppl. 3).  
            Ideally, ambulatory-care settings in which patients
 with TB are
            frequently examined or treated should have a TB
 isolation room(s)
            available. Such rooms are not necessary in
 ambulatory-care
            settings in which patients who have confirmed or
 suspected TB are
            seen infrequently. However, these facilities should
 have a
            written protocol for early identification of patients
 with TB
            symptoms and referral to an area or a collaborating
 facility
            where the patient can be evaluated and managed
 appropriately.
            These protocols should be reviewed on a regular basis
 and revised
            as necessary. The additional guidelines in Section II.H
 should be
            followed in ambulatory-care settings where
 cough-inducing
            procedures are performed on patients who may have
 active TB.  
        Management of Hospitalized Patients Who Have Confirmed or
 Suspected
        TB  
            Initiation of isolation for TB  
                In hospitals and other inpatient facilities, any
 patient
                suspected of having or known to have infectious TB
 should be
                placed in a TB isolation room that has currently
 recommended
                ventilation characteristics (Section II.E.3; Suppl.
 3).
                Written policies for initiating isolation should
 specify a)
                the indications for isolation, b) the person(s)
 authorized to
                initiate and discontinue isolation, c) the
 isolation
                practices to follow, d) the monitoring of
 isolation, e) the
                management of patients who do not adhere to
 isolation
                practices, and f) the criteria for discontinuing
 isolation.  
                In rare circumstances, placing more than one TB
 patient
                together in the same room may be acceptable. This
 practice is
                sometimes referred to as "cohorting." Because of
 the risk for
                patients becoming superinfected with drug-resistant
                organisms, patients with TB should be placed in the
 same room
                only if all patients involved a) have
 culture-confirmed TB,
                b) have drug-susceptibility test results available
 on a
                current specimen obtained during the present
 hospitalization,
                c) have identical drug-susceptibility patterns on
 these
                specimens, and d) are on effective therapy. Having
 isolates
                with identical DNA fingerprint patterns is not
 adequate
                evidence for placing two TB patients together in
 the same
                room, because isolates with the same DNA
 fingerprint pattern
                can have different drug-susceptibility patterns.  
                Pediatric patients with suspected or confirmed TB
 should be
                evaluated for potential infectiousness according to
 the same
                criteria as are adults (i.e., on the basis of
 symptoms,
                sputum AFB smears, radiologic findings, and other
 criteria)
                (Suppl. 1). Children who may be infectious should
 be placed
                in isolation until they are determined to be
 noninfectious.
                Pediatric patients who may be infectious include
 those who
                have laryngeal or extensive pulmonary involvement,
 pronounced
                cough, positive sputum AFB smears, or cavitary TB
 or those
                for whom cough-inducing procedures are performed
 (44).  
                The source of infection for a child with TB is
 often a member
                of the child's family (45). Therefore, parents and
 other
                visitors of all pediatric TB patients should be
 evaluated for
                TB as soon as possible. Until they have been
 evaluated, or
                the source case is identified, they should wear
 surgical
                masks when in areas of the facility outside of the
 child's
                room, and they should refrain from visiting common
 areas in
                the facility (e.g., the cafeteria or lounge areas).
  
                TB patients in intensive-care units should be
 treated the
                same as patients in noncritical-care settings. They
 should be
                placed in TB isolation and have respiratory
 secretions
                submitted for AFB smear and culture if they have
 undiagnosed
                pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB.  
                If readmitted to a health-care facility, patients
 who are
                known to have active TB and who have not completed
 therapy
                should have TB precautions applied until a
 determination has
                been made that they are noninfectious (Suppl. 1).  
            TB isolation practices  
                Patients who are placed in TB isolation should be
 educated
                about the mechanisms of M. tuberculosis
 transmission and the
                reasons for their being placed in isolation. They
 should be
                taught to cover their mouths and noses with a
 tissue when
                coughing or sneezing, even while in the isolation
 room, to
                contain liquid drops and droplets before they are
 expelled
                into the air (46).  
                Efforts should be made to facilitate patient
 adherence to
                isolation measures (e.g., staying in the TB
 isolation room).
                Such efforts might include the use of incentives
 (e.g.,
                providing them with telephones, televisions, or
 radios in
                their rooms or allowing special dietary requests).
 Efforts
                should also be made to address other problems that
 could
                interfere with adherence to isolation (e.g.,
 management of
                the patient's withdrawal from addictive substances
 {including
                tobacco}).  
                Patients placed in isolation should remain in their
 isolation
                rooms with the door closed. If possible, diagnostic
 and
                treatment procedures should be performed in the
 isolation
                rooms to avoid transporting patients through other
 areas of
                the facility. If patients who may have infectious
 TB must be
                transported outside their isolation rooms for
 medically
                essential procedures that cannot be performed in
 the
                isolation rooms, they should wear surgical masks
 that cover
                their mouths and noses during transport. Persons
 transporting
                the patients do not need to wear respiratory
 protection
                outside the TB isolation rooms. Procedures for
 these patients
                should be scheduled at times when they can be
 performed
                rapidly and when waiting areas are less crowded.  
                Treatment and procedure rooms in which patients who
 have
                infectious TB or who have an undiagnosed pulmonary
 disease
                and are at high risk for active TB receive care
 should meet
                the ventilation recommendations for isolation rooms
 (Section
                II.E.3; Suppl. 3). Ideally, facilities in which TB
 patients
                are frequently treated should have an area in the
 radiology
                department that is ventilated separately for TB
 patients. If
                this is not possible, TB patients should wear
 surgical masks
                and should stay in the radiology suite the minimum
 amount of
                time possible, then be returned promptly to their
 isolation
                rooms.  
                The number of persons entering an isolation room
 should be
                minimal. All persons who enter an isolation room
 should wear
                respiratory protection (Section II.G; Suppl. 4).
 The
                patient's visitors should be given respirators to
 wear while
                in the isolation room, and they should be given
 general
                instructions on how to use their respirators.  
                Disposable items contaminated with respiratory
 secretions are
                not associated with transmission of M.
 tuberculosis. However,
                for general infection-control purposes, these items
 should be
                handled and transported in a manner that reduces
 the risk for
                transmitting other microorganisms to patients,
 HCWs, and
                visitors and that decreases environmental
 contamination in
                the health-care facility. Such items should be
 disposed of in
                accordance with hospital policy and applicable
 regulations
                (Suppl. 5).  
            The TB isolation room  
                TB isolation rooms should be single-patient rooms
 with
                special ventilation characteristics appropriate for
 the
                purposes of isolation (Suppl. 3). The primary
 purposes of TB
                isolation rooms are to a) separate patients who are
 likely to
                have infectious TB from other persons; b) provide
 an environ-
                ment that will allow reduction of the concentration
 of
                droplet nuclei through various engineering methods;
 and c)
                prevent the escape of droplet nuclei from the TB
 isolation
                room and treatment room, thus preventing entry of
 M. tuber-
                culosis into the corridor and other areas of the
 facility.  
                To prevent the escape of droplet nuclei, the TB
 isolation
                room should be maintained under negative pressure
 (Suppl. 3).
                Doors to isolation rooms should be kept closed,
 except when
                patients or personnel must enter or exit the room,
 so that
                negative pressure can be maintained.  
                Negative pressure in the room should be monitored
 daily while
                the room is being used for TB isolation.  
                The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and
 Air-
                Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) (47), the
 American
                Institute of Architects (AIA) (48), and the Health
 Resources
                and Services Administration (49) recommend a
 minimum of 6 air
                changes per hour (ACH) for TB isolation and
 treatment rooms.
                This ventilation rate is based on comfort and odor
 control
                considerations. The effectiveness of this level of
 airflow in
                reducing the concentration of droplet nuclei in the
 room,
                thus reducing the transmission of airborne
 pathogens, has not
                been evaluated directly or adequately.  Ventilation rates of greater than 6
ACH are likely
 to produce
                an incrementally greater reduction in the
 concentration of
                bacteria in a room than are lower rates (50-52).
 However,
                accurate quantitation of decreases in risk that
 would result
                from specific increases in general ventilation
 levels has not
                been performed and may not be possible.  For the purposes of reducing the
concentration of
 droplet
                nuclei, TB isolation and treatment rooms in
 existing health-
                care facilities should have an airflow of greater
 than or
                equal to 6 ACH. Where feasible, this airflow rate
 should be
                increased to greater than or equal to 12 ACH by
 adjusting or
                modifying the ventilation system or by using
 auxiliary means
                (e.g., recirculation of air through fixed HEPA
 filtration
                systems or portable air cleaners) (Suppl. 3,
 Section
                II.B.5.a) (53). New construction or renovation of
 existing
                health-care facilities should be designed so that
 TB
                isolation rooms achieve an airflow of greater than
 or equal
                to 12 ACH.  
                Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms
 used to treat
                patients who have known or suspected infectious TB
 should be
                exhausted to the outside in accordance with
 applicable
                federal, state, and local regulations. The air
 should not be
                recirculated into the general ventilation. In some
 instances,
                recirculation of air into the general ventilation
 system from
                such rooms is unavoidable (i.e., in existing
 facilities in
                which the ventilation system or facility
 configuration makes
                venting the exhaust to the outside impossible). In
 such
                cases, HEPA filters should be installed in the
 exhaust duct
                leading from the room to the general ventilation
 system to
                remove infectious organisms and particulates the
 size of
                droplet nuclei from the air before it is returned
 to the
                general ventilation system (Section II.F; Suppl.
 3). Air from
                TB isolation and treatment rooms in new or
 renovated
                facilities should not be recirculated into the
 general
                ventilation system.  
                Although not required, an anteroom may increase the
 effec-
                tiveness of the isolation room by minimizing the
 potential
                escape of droplet nuclei into the corridor when the
 door is
                opened. To work effectively, the anteroom should
 have
                positive air pressure in relation to the isolation
 room. The
                pressure relationship between the anteroom and the
 corridor
                may vary according to ventilation design.  
                Upper-room air UVGI may be used as an adjunct to
 general
                ventilation in the isolation room (Section II.F;
 Suppl. 3).
                Air in the isolation room may be recirculated
 within the room
                through HEPA filters or UVGI devices to increase
 the
                effective ACH and to increase thermal efficiency.  
                Health-care facilities should have enough isolation
 rooms to
                appropriately isolate all patients who have
 suspected or
                confirmed active TB. This number should be
 estimated using
                the results of the risk assessment of the
 health-care
                facility. Except for minimal- and very low-risk
 health-care
                facilities, all acute-care inpatient facilities
 should have
                at least one TB isolation room (Section II.B).  
                Grouping isolation rooms together in one area of
 the facility
                may reduce the possibility of transmitting M.
 tuberculosis to
                other patients and may facilitate care of TB
 patients and the
                installation and maintenance of optimal engineering
 (parti-
                cularly ventilation) controls.  
            Discontinuation of TB isolation  
                TB isolation can be discontinued if the diagnosis
 of TB is
                ruled out. For some patients, TB can be ruled out
 when
                another diagnosis is confirmed. If a diagnosis of
 TB cannot
                be ruled out, the patient should remain in
 isolation until a
                determination has been made that the patient is
 noninfec-
                tious. However, patients can be discharged from the
 health-
                care facility while still potentially infectious if
 appro-
                priate postdischarge arrangements can be ensured
 (Section
                II.E.5).  
                The length of time required for a TB patient to
 become
                noninfectious after starting anti-TB therapy varies
 consid-
                erably (Suppl. 1). Isolation should be discontinued
 only when
                the patient is on effective therapy, is improving
 clinically,
                and has had three consecutive negative sputum AFB
 smears
                collected on different days.  
                Hospitalized patients who have active TB should be
 monitored
                for relapse by having sputum AFB smears examined
 regularly
                (e.g., every 2 weeks). Nonadherence to therapy
 (i.e., failure
                to take medications as prescribed) and the presence
 of drug-
                resistant organisms are the two most common reasons
 why
                patients remain infectious despite treatment. These
 reasons
                should be considered if a patient does not respond
 clinically
                to therapy within 2-3 weeks.  
                Continued isolation throughout the hospitalization
 should be
                strongly considered for patients who have MDR-TB
 because of
                the tendency for treatment failure or relapse
 (i.e.,
                difficulty in maintaining noninfectiousness) that
 has been
                observed in such cases.  
            Discharge planning  
                Before a TB patient is discharged from the
 health-care
                facility, the facility's staff and public health
 authorities
                should collaborate to ensure continuation of
 therapy.
                Discharge planning in the health-care facility
 should
                include, at a minimum, a) a confirmed outpatient
 appointment
                with the provider who will manage the patient until
 the
                patient is cured, b) sufficient medication to take
 until the
                outpatient appointment, and c) placement into case
 management
                (e.g., DOT) or outreach programs of the public
 health
                department. These plans should be initiated and in
 place
                before the patient's discharge.  
                Patients who may be infectious at the time of
 discharge
                should only be discharged to facilities that have
 isolation
                capability or to their homes. Plans for discharging
 a patient
                who will return home must consider whether all the
 household
                members were infected previously and whether any
 uninfected
                household members are at very high risk for active
 TB if
                infected (e.g., children less than 4 years of age
 or persons
                infected with HIV or otherwise severely
 immunocompromised).
                If the household does include such persons,
 arrangements
                should be made to prevent them from being exposed
 to the TB
                patient until a determination has been made that
 the patient
                is noninfectious.  
        Engineering Control Recommendations  
            General ventilation  This section deals only with engineering controls for
 general-use
            areas of health-care facilities (e.g., waiting-room
 areas and
            emergency departments). Recommendations for engineering
 controls
            for specific areas of the facility (e.g., TB isolation
 rooms) are
            contained in the sections encompassing those areas.
 Details
            regarding ventilation design, evaluation, and
 supplemental
            approaches are described in Supplement 3.  
                Health-care facilities should either a) include as
 part of
                their staff an engineer or other professional with
 expertise
                in ventilation or b) have this expertise available
 from a
                consultant who is an expert in ventilation
 engineering and
                who also has hospital experience. These persons
 should work
                closely with infection-control staff to assist in
 controlling
                airborne infections.  
                Ventilation system designs in health-care
 facilities should
                meet any applicable federal, state, and local
 requirements.  
                The direction of airflow in health-care facilities
 should be
                designed, constructed, and maintained so that air
 flows from
                clean areas to less-clean areas.  
                Health-care facilities serving populations that
 have a high
                prevalence of TB may need to supplement the general
 ventil-
                ation or use additional engineering approaches
 (i.e., HEPA
                filtration or UVGI) in general-use areas where TB
 patients
                are likely to go (e.g., waiting-room areas,
 emergency depart-
                ments, and radiology suites). A single-pass,
 nonrecirculating
                system that exhausts air to the outside, a
 recirculation
                system that passes air through HEPA filters before
 recir-
                culating it to the general ventilation system, or
 upper air
                UVGI may be used in such areas.  
            Additional engineering control approaches  
                HEPA filtration  HEPA filters may be used in a number of ways to
 reduce or
                eliminate infectious droplet nuclei from room air
 or exhaust
                (Suppl. 3). These methods include placement of HEPA
 filters  
                    in exhaust ducts discharging air from booths or
 enclosures
                    into the surrounding room; b) in ducts or in
 ceiling- or
                    wall-mounted units, for recirculation of air within
 an
                    individual room (fixed recirculation systems); c)
 in portable
                    air cleaners; d) in exhaust ducts to remove droplet
 nuclei
                    from air being discharged to the outside, either
 directly or
                    through ventilation equipment; and e) in ducts
 discharging
                    air from the TB isolation room into the general
 ventilation
                    system. In any application, HEPA filters should be
 installed
                    carefully and maintained meticulously to ensure
 adequate
                    functioning.  The manufacturers of in-room air cleaning equipment
 should
                    provide documentation of the HEPA filter efficiency
 and the
                    efficiency of the device in lowering room air
 contaminant
                    levels.  
                UVGI  For general-use areas in which the risk for
 transmission of
                M. tuberculosis is relatively high, UVGI lamps may
 be used as
                an adjunct to ventilation for reducing the
 concentration of
                infectious droplet nuclei (Suppl. 3), although the
 effective-
                ness of such units has not been evaluated
 adequately. Ultra-
                violet (UV) units can be installed in a room or
 corridor to
                irradiate the air in the upper portion of the room
 (i.e.,
                upper-room air irradiation), or they can be
 installed in
                ducts to irradiate air passing through the ducts.
 UV units
                installed in ducts should not be substituted for
 HEPA filters
                in ducts that discharge air from TB isolation rooms
 into the
                general ventilation system. However, UV units can
 be used in
                ducts that recirculate air back into the same room.
  To function properly and decrease hazards to HCWs
 and others
                in the health-care facility, UV lamps should be
 installed
                properly and maintained adequately, which includes
 the
                monitoring of irradiance levels. UV tubes should be
 changed
                according to the manufacturer's instructions or
 when meter
                readings indicate tube failure. An employee trained
 in the
                use and handling of UV lamps should be responsible
 for these
                measures and for keeping maintenance records.
 Applicable
                safety guidelines should be followed. Caution
 should be
                exercised to protect HCWs, patients, visitors, and
 others
                from excessive exposure to UV radiation.  
        Respiratory Protection  
            Personal respiratory protection should be used by a)
 persons
            entering rooms in which patients with known or
 suspected
            infectious TB are being isolated, b) persons present
 during
            cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures
 performed on such
            patients, and c) persons in other settings where
 administrative
            and engineering controls are not likely to protect them
 from
            inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei (Suppl. 4).
 These
            other settings include transporting patients who may
 have
            infectious TB in emergency transport vehicles and
 providing
            urgent surgical or dental care to patients who may have
            infectious TB before a determination has been made that
 the
            patient is noninfectious (Suppl. 1).  
            Respiratory protective devices used in health-care
 settings for
            protection against M. tuberculosis should meet the
 following
            standard performance criteria:  
                The ability to filter particles 1 um in size in the
 unloaded
                ***** state with a filter efficiency of greater than or
 equal to
                95% (i.e., filter leakage of less than or equal to 5%),
 given
                flow rates of up to 50 L per minute.  
                The ability to be qualitatively or quantitatively
 fit tested
                in a reliable way to obtain a face-seal leakage of less
 than or
                equal to 10% (54,55).  
                The ability to fit the different facial sizes and
 character-
                istics of HCWs, which can usually be met by making the
                respirators available in at least three sizes.  
                The ability to be checked for facepiece fit, in
 accordance
                with standards established by the Occupational Safety
 and Health
                Administration (OSHA) and good industrial hygiene
 practice, by
                HCWs each time they put on their respirators (54,55).  
            The facility's risk assessment may identify a limited
 number of
            selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed on
 patients
            suspected of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased
 persons
            suspected of having had active TB at the time of death)
 where the
            estimated risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis may
 be such
            that a level of respiratory protection exceeding the
 standard
            performance criteria is appropriate. In such
 circumstances, a
            level of respiratory protection exceeding the standard
 criteria
            and compatible with patient-care delivery (e.g., more
 protective
            negative-pressure respirators; powered air-purifying
 particulate
            respirators {PAPRs}; or positive-pressure air-line,
 half-mask
            respirators) should be provided by employers to HCWs
 who are
            exposed to M. tuberculosis. Information on these and
 other
            respirators is in the NIOSH Guide to Industrial
 Respiratory
            Protection (55) and in Supplement 4 of this document.  
            In some settings, HCWs may be at risk for two types of
 exposure:  
                inhalation of M. tuberculosis and b) mucous membrane
 exposure
                to fluids that may contain bloodborne pathogens. In
 these
                settings, protection against both types of exposure
 should be
                used.  
            When operative procedures (or other procedures
 requiring a
            sterile field) are performed on patients who may have
 infectious
            TB, respiratory protection worn by the HCW should serve
 two
            functions: a) it should protect the surgical field from
 the
            respiratory secretions of the HCW, and b) it should
 protect the
            HCW from infectious droplet nuclei that may be expelled
 by the
            patient or generated by the procedure. Respirators with
            exhalation valves and most positive-pressure
 respirators do not
            protect the sterile field.  
            Health-care facilities in which respiratory protection
 is used to
            prevent inhalation of M. tuberculosis are required by
 OSHA to
            develop, implement, and maintain a respiratory
 protection program
            (Suppl. 4). All HCWs who use respiratory protection
 should be
            included in this program. Visitors to TB patients
 should be given
            respirators to wear while in isolation rooms, and they
 should be
            given general instructions on how to use their
 respirators.  
            Facilities that do not have isolation rooms and do not
 perform
            cough-inducing procedures on patients who may have TB
 may not
            need to have a respiratory protection program for TB.
 However,
            such facilities should have written protocols for the
 early
            identification of patients who have signs or symptoms
 of TB and
            procedures for referring these patients to a facility
 where they
            can be evaluated and managed appropriately. These
 protocols
            should be evaluated regularly and revised as needed.  
            Surgical masks are designed to prevent the respiratory
 secretions
            of the person wearing the mask from entering the air.
 To reduce
            the expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air, patients
 suspected
            of having TB should wear surgical masks when not in TB
 isolation
            rooms. These patients do not need to wear particulate
 respir-
            ators, which are designed to filter the air before it
 is inhaled
            by the person wearing the respirator. Patients
 suspected of
            having or known to have TB should never wear a
 respirator that
            has an exhalation valve, because this type of
 respirator does not
            prevent expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air.  
        Cough-Inducing and Aerosol-Generating Procedures  
            General guidelines  Procedures that involve instrumentation of the lower
 respiratory
            tract or induce coughing can increase the likelihood of
 droplet
            nuclei being expelled into the air. These
 cough-inducing
            procedures include endotracheal intubation and
 suctioning,
            diagnostic sputum induction, aerosol treatments (e.g.,
 penta-
            midine therapy), and bronchoscopy. Other procedures
 that can
            generate aerosols (e.g., irrigation of tuberculous
 abscesses,
            homogenizing or lyophilizing tissue, or other
 processing of
            tissue that may contain tubercle bacilli) are also
 covered by
            these recommendations.  
                Cough-inducing procedures should not be performed
 on patients
                who may have infectious TB unless the procedures
 are
                absolutely necessary and can be performed with
 appropriate
                precautions.  
                All cough-inducing procedures performed on patients
 who may
                have infectious TB should be performed using local
 exhaust
                ventilation devices (e.g., booths or special
 enclosures) or,
                if this is not feasible, in a room that meets the
 ventilation
                requirements for TB isolation.  
                HCWs should wear respiratory protection when
 present in rooms
                or enclosures in which cough-inducing procedures
 are being
                performed on patients who may have infectious TB.  
                After completion of cough-inducing procedures,
 patients who
                may have infectious TB should remain in their
 isolation rooms
                or enclosures and not return to common waiting
 areas until
                coughing subsides. They should be given tissues and
                instructed to cover their mouths and noses with the
 tissues
                when coughing. If TB patients must recover from
 sedatives or
                anesthesia after a procedure (e.g, after a
 bronchoscopy),
                they should be placed in separate isolation rooms
 (and not in
                recovery rooms with other patients) while they are
 being
                monitored.  
                Before the booth, enclosure, or room is used for
 another
                patient, enough time should be allowed to pass for
 at least
                99% of airborne contaminants to be removed. This
 time will
                vary according to the efficiency of the ventilation
 or
                filtration used (Suppl. 3, Table_S31).  
            Special considerations for bronchoscopy  
                If performing bronchoscopy in positive-pressure
 rooms (e.g.,
                operating rooms) is unavoidable, TB should be ruled
 out as a
                diagnosis before the procedure is performed. If the
 broncho-
                scopy is being performed for the purpose of
 diagnosing
                pulmonary disease and that diagnosis could include
 TB, the
                procedure should be performed in a room that meets
 TB
                isolation ventilation requirements.  
            Special considerations for the administration of
 aerosolized
            pentamidine  
                Patients should be screened for active TB before
 prophylactic
                therapy with aerosolized pentamidine is initiated.
 Screening
                should include obtaining a medical history and
 performing
                skin testing and chest radiography.  
                Before each subsequent treatment with aerosolized
 penta-
                midine, patients should be screened for symptoms
 suggestive
                of TB (e.g., development of a productive cough). If
 such
                symptoms are elicited, a diagnostic evaluation for
 TB should
                be initiated.  
                Patients who have suspected or confirmed active TB
 should
                take, if clinically practical, oral prophylaxis for
 P.
                carinii pneumonia.  
        Education and Training of HCWs  All HCWs, including physicians, should receive
education
 regarding TB
        that is relevant to persons in their particular
 occupational group.
        Ideally, training should be conducted before initial
 assignment, and
        the need for additional training should be reevaluated
 periodically
        (e.g., once a year). The level and detail of this education
 will vary
        according to the HCW's work responsibilities and the level
 of risk in
        the facility (or area of the facility) in which the HCW
 works.
        However, the program may include the following elements:  
            The basic concepts of M. tuberculosis transmission,
 pathogenesis,
            and diagnosis, including information concerning the
 difference
            between latent TB infection and active TB disease, the
 signs and
            symptoms of TB, and the possibility of reinfection.  
            The potential for occupational exposure to persons who
 have
            infectious TB in the health-care facility, including
 information
            concerning the prevalence of TB in the community and
 facility,
            the ability of the facility to properly isolate
 patients who have
            active TB, and situations with increased risk for
 exposure to M.
            tuberculosis.  
            The principles and practices of infection control that
 reduce the
            risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis, including
 information
            concerning the hierarchy of TB infection-control
 measures and the
            written policies and procedures of the facility.
 Site-specific
            control measures should be provided to HCWs working in
 areas that
            require control measures in addition to those of the
 basic TB
            infection-control program.  
            The purpose of PPD skin testing, the significance of a
 positive
            PPD test result, and the importance of participating in
 the skin-
            test program.  
            The principles of preventive therapy for latent TB
 infection.
            These principles include the indications, use,
 effectiveness, and
            the potential adverse effects of the drugs (Suppl. 2).  
            The HCW's responsibility to seek prompt medical
 evaluation if a
            PPD test conversion occurs or if symptoms develop that
 could be
            caused by TB. Medical evaluation will enable HCWs who
 have TB to
            receive appropriate therapy and will help to prevent
 transmission
            of M. tuberculosis to patients and other HCWs.  
            The principles of drug therapy for active TB.  
            The importance of notifying the facility if the HCW is
 diagnosed
            with active TB so that contact investigation procedures
 can be
            initiated.  
            The responsibilities of the facility to maintain the
 confiden-
            tiality of the HCW while ensuring that the HCW who has
 TB
            receives appropriate therapy and is noninfectious
 before
            returning to duty.  
            The higher risks associated with TB infection in
 persons who have
            HIV infection or other causes of severely impaired
 cell-mediated
            immunity, including a) the more frequent and rapid
 development of
            clinical TB after infection with M. tuberculosis, b)
 the
            differences in the clinical presentation of disease,
 and c) the
            high mortality rate associated with MDR-TB in such
 persons.  
            The potential development of cutaneous anergy as immune
 function
            (as measured by CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts) declines.  
            Information regarding the efficacy and safety of BCG
 vaccination
            and the principles of PPD screening among BCG
 recipients.  
            The facility's policy on voluntary work reassignment
 options for
            immunocompromised HCWs.  
        HCW  Counseling,  Screening,  and  Evaluation   A  TB  counseling,  screening,  and
prevention program for HCWs
 should be
        established to protect both HCWs and patients. HCWs who
 have positive
        PPD test results, PPD test conversions, or symptoms
 suggestive of TB
        should be identified, evaluated to rule out a diagnosis of
 active TB,
        and started on therapy or preventive therapy if indicated
 (5). In
        addition, the results of the HCW PPD screening program will
        contribute to evaluation of the effectiveness of current
 infection-
        control practices.  
            Counseling HCWs regarding TB  
                Because of the increased risk for rapid progression
 from
                latent TB infection to active TB in HIV-infected or
 otherwise
                severely immunocompromised persons, all HCWs should
 know if
                they have a medical condition or are receiving a
 medical
                treatment that may lead to severely impaired
 cell-mediated
                immunity. HCWs who may be at risk for HIV infection
 should
                know their HIV status (i.e., they should be
 encouraged to
                voluntarily seek counseling and testing for HIV
 antibody
                status). Existing guidelines for counseling and
 testing
                should be followed routinely (56). Knowledge of
 these
                conditions allows the HCW to seek the appropriate
 preventive
                measures outlined in this document and to consider
 voluntary
                work reassignments. Of particular importance is
 that HCWs
                need to know their HIV status if they are at risk
 for HIV
                infection and they work in settings where patients
 who have
                drug-resistant TB may be encountered.  
                All HCWs should be informed about the need to
 follow existing
                recommendations for infection control to minimize
 the risk
                for exposure to infectious agents; implementation
 of these
                recommendations will greatly reduce the risk for
 occupational
                infections among HCWs (57). All HCWs should also be
 informed
                about the potential risks to severely
 immunocompromised
                persons associated with caring for patients who
 have some
                infectious diseases, including TB. It should be
 emphasized
                that limiting exposure to TB patients is the most
 protective
                measure that severely immunosuppressed HCWs can
 take to avoid
                becoming infected with M. tuberculosis. HCWs who
 have
                severely impaired cell-mediated immunity and who
 may be
                exposed to M. tuberculosis may consider a change in
 job
                setting to avoid such exposure. HCWs should be
 advised of the
                option that severely immunocompromised HCWs can
 choose to
                transfer voluntarily to areas and work activities
 in which
                there is the lowest possible risk for exposure to
 M. tuber-
                culosis. This choice should be a personal decision
 for HCWs
                after they have been informed of the risks to their
 health.  
                Employers should make reasonable accommodations
 (e.g.,
                alternative job assignments) for employees who have
 a health
                condition that compromises cell-mediated immunity
 and who
                work in settings where they may be exposed to M.
 tuber-
                culosis. HCWs who are known to be immunocompromised
 should be
                referred to employee health professionals who can
 indivi-
                dually counsel the employees regarding their risk
 for TB.
                Upon the request of the immunocompromised HCW,
 employers
                should offer, but not compel, a work setting in
 which the HCW
                would have the lowest possible risk for
 occupational exposure
                to M. tuberculosis. Evaluation of these situations
 should
                also include consideration of the provisions of the
 Americans
                With Disabilities Act of 1990 ****** and other
 applicable
                federal, state, and local laws.  
                All HCWs should be informed that immunosuppressed
 HCWs should
                have appropriate follow-up and screening for
 infectious
                diseases, including TB, provided by their medical
 practi-
                tioner. HCWs who are known to be HIV-infected or
 otherwise
                severely immunosuppressed should be tested for
 cutaneous
                anergy at the time of PPD testing (Suppl. 2).
 Consideration
                should be given to retesting, at least every 6
 months, those
                immunocompromised HCWs who are potentially exposed
 to M.
                tuberculosis because of the high risk for rapid
 progression
                to active TB if they become infected.  
                Information provided by HCWs regarding their immune
 status
                should be treated confidentially. If the HCW
 requests
                voluntary job reassignment, the confidentiality of
 the HCW
                should be maintained. Facilities should have
 written
                procedures on confidential handling of such
 information.  
            Screening HCWs for active TB  
                Any HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a cough
 lasting
                greater than or equal to 3 weeks), especially in
 the presence
                of other signs or symptoms compatible with active
 TB (e.g.,
                weight loss, night sweats, bloody sputum, anorexia,
 or
                fever), should be evaluated promptly for TB. The
 HCW should
                not return to the workplace until a diagnosis of TB
 has been
                excluded or until the HCW is on therapy and a
 determination
                has been made that the HCW is noninfectious.  
            Screening HCWs for latent TB infection  
                The risk assessment should identify which HCWs have
 potential
                for exposure to M. tuberculosis and the frequency
 with which
                the exposure may occur. This information is used to
 determine
                which HCWs to include in the skin-testing program
 and the
                frequency with which they should be tested
 (Table_2).  
                If HCWs are from risks groups with increased
 prevalence of
                TB, consideration may be given to including them in
 the skin-
                testing program, even if they do not have potential
 occupa-
                tional exposure to M. tuberculosis, so that
 converters can be
                identified and preventive therapy offered.  
                Administrators of health-care facilities should
 ensure that
                physicians and other personnel not paid by, but
 working in,
                the facility receive skin testing at appropriate
 intervals
                for their occupational group and work location.  
                During the pre-employment physical or when applying
 for
                hospital privileges, HCWs who have potential for
 exposure to
                M. tuberculosis (Table_2), including those with
 a history
                of BCG vaccination, should have baseline PPD skin
 testing
                performed (Suppl. 2). For HCWs who have not had a
 documented
                negative PPD test result during the preceding 12
 months, the
                baseline PPD testing should employ the two-step
 method; this
                will detect boosting phenomena that might be
 misinterpreted
                as a skin-test conversion. Decisions concerning the
 use of
                the two-step procedure for baseline testing in a
 particular
                facility should be based on the frequency of
 boosting in that
                facility.  
                HCWs who have a documented history of a positive
 PPD test,
                adequate treatment for disease, or adequate
 preventive
                therapy for infection, should be exempt from
 further PPD
                screening unless they develop signs or symptoms
 suggestive of
                TB.  
                PPD-negative HCWs should undergo repeat PPD testing
 at
                regular intervals as determined by the risk
 assessment
                (Section II.B). In addition, these HCWs should be
 tested
                whenever they have been exposed to a TB patient and
 appro-
                priate precautions were not observed at the time of
 exposure
                (Section II.K.3). Performing PPD testing of HCWs
 who work in
                the same area or occupational group on different
 scheduled
                dates (e.g., test them on their birthdays or on
 their
                employment anniversary dates), rather than testing
 all HCWs
                in the area or group on the same day, may lead to
 earlier
                detection of M. tuberculosis transmission.  
                All PPD tests should be administered, read, and
 interpreted
                in accordance with current guidelines by specified
 trained
                personnel (Suppl. 2). At the time their test
 results are
                read, HCWs should be informed about the
 interpretation of
                both positive and negative PPD test results. This
 information
                should indicate that the interpretation of an
 induration that
                is 5-9 mm in diameter depends on the HCW's immune
 status and
                history of exposure to persons who have infectious
 TB. Speci-
                fically, HCWs who have indurations of 5-9 mm in
 diameter
                should be advised that such results may be
 considered
                positive for HCWs who are contacts of persons with
 infectious
                TB or who have HIV infection or other causes of
 severe
                immunosuppression (e.g., immunosuppressive therapy
 for organ
                transplantation).  
                When an HCW who is not assigned regularly to a
 single work
                area has a PPD test conversion, appropriate
 personnel should
                identify the areas where the HCW worked during the
 time when
                infection was likely to have occurred. This
 information can
                then be considered in analyzing the risk for
 transmission in
                those areas.  
                In any area of the facility where transmission of
 M. tuber-
                culosis is known to have occurred, a problem
 evaluation
                should be conducted (Section II.K), and the
 frequency of skin
                testing should be determined according to the
 applicable risk
                category (Section II.B).  
                PPD test results should be recorded confidentially
 in the
                individual HCW's employee health record and in an
 aggregate
                database of all HCW PPD test results. The database
 can be
                analyzed periodically to estimate the risk for
 acquiring new
                infection in specific areas or occupational groups
 in the
                facility.  
            Evaluation and management of HCWs who have positive PPD
 test
            results or active TB  
                Evaluation  
                    All HCWs with newly recognized positive PPD
 test results
                    or PPD test conversions should be evaluated
 promptly for
                    active TB. This evaluation should include a
 clinical
                    examination and a chest radiograph. If the
 history,
                    clinical examination, or chest radiograph is
 compatible
                    with active TB, additional tests should be
 performed
                    (Section II.C.2). If symptoms compatible with
 TB are
                    present, the HCW should be excluded from the
 workplace
                    until either a) a diagnosis of active TB is
 ruled out or
                    b) a diagnosis of active TB was established,
 the HCW is
                    being treated, and a determination has been
 made that the
                    HCW is noninfectious (Suppl. 2). HCWs who do
 not have
                    active TB should be evaluated for preventive
 therapy
                    according to published guidelines (Suppl. 2).  
                    If an HCW's PPD test result converts to
 positive, a
                    history of confirmed or suspected TB exposure
 should be
                    obtained in an attempt to determine the
 potential source.
                    When the source of exposure is known, the
 drug-suscepti-
                    bility pattern of the M. tuberculosis isolated
 from the
                    source should be identified so that the correct
 curative
                    or preventive therapy can be initiated for the
 HCW with
                    the PPD test conversion. The
 drug-susceptibility pattern
                    should be recorded in the HCW's medical record,
 where it
                    will be available if the HCW subsequently
 develops active
                    TB and needs therapy specific for the
 drug-susceptibility
                    pattern.  
                    All HCWs, including those with histories of
 positive PPD
                    test results, should be reminded periodically
 about the
                    symptoms of TB and the need for prompt
 evaluation of any
                    pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB.  
                Routine and follow-up chest radiographs  
                    Routine chest radiographs are not required for
 asympto-
                    matic, PPD-negative HCWs. HCWs with positive
 PPD test
                    results should have a chest radiograph as part
 of the
                    initial evaluation of their PPD test; if
 negative, repeat
                    chest radiographs are not needed unless
 symptoms develop
                    that could be attributed to TB (58). However,
 more
                    frequent monitoring for symptoms of TB may be
 considered
                    for recent converters and other PPD-positive
 HCWs who are
                    at increased risk for developing active TB
 (e.g., HIV-
                    infected or otherwise severely
 immunocompromised HCWs).  
                Workplace restrictions  
                    Active TB  
                        HCWs with pulmonary or laryngeal TB pose a
 risk to
                        patients and other HCWs while they are
 infectious,
                        and they should be excluded from the
 workplace until
                        they are noninfectious. The same work
 restrictions
                        apply to all HCWs regardless of their
 immune status.  
                        Before the HCW who has TB can return to the
 work-
                        place, the health-care facility should have
 docu-
                        mentation from the HCW's health-care
 provider that
                        the HCW is receiving adequate therapy, the
 cough has
                        resolved, and the HCW has had three
 consecutive
                        negative sputum smears collected on
 different days.
                        After work duties are resumed and while the
 HCW
                        remains on anti-TB therapy, facility staff
 should
                        receive periodic documentation from the
 HCW's
                        health-care provider that the HCW is being
                        maintained on effective drug therapy for
 the
                        recommended time period and that the sputum
 AFB
                        smears continue to be negative.  
                        HCWs with active laryngeal or pulmonary TB
 who
                        discontinue treatment before they are cured
 should
                        be evaluated promptly for infectiousness.
 If the
                        evaluation determines that they are still
 infec-
                        tious, they should be excluded from the
 workplace
                        until treatment has been resumed, an
 adequate
                        response to therapy has been documented,
 and three
                        more consecutive sputum AFB smears
 collected on
                        different days have been negative.  
                        HCWs who have TB at sites other than the
 lung or
                        larynx usually do not need to be excluded
 from the
                        workplace if a diagnosis of concurrent
 pulmonary TB
                        has been ruled out.  
                    Latent TB infection  
                        HCWs receiving preventive treatment for
 latent TB
                        infection should not be restricted from
 their usual
                        work activities.  
                        HCWs with latent TB infection who cannot
 take or who
                        do not accept or complete a full course of
 preven-
                        tive therapy should not be excluded from
 the work-
                        place. These HCWs should be counseled about
 the risk
                        for developing active TB and instructed
 regularly to
                        seek prompt evaluation if signs or symptoms
 develop
                        that could be caused by TB.  
        Problem Evaluation  Epidemiologic investigations may be indicated for several
 situations.
        These include, but are not limited to, a) the occurrence of
 PPD test
        conversions or active TB in HCWs; b) the occurrence of
 possible
        person-to-person transmission of M. tuberculosis; and c)
 situations
        in which patients or HCWs with active TB are not promptly
 identified
        and isolated, thus exposing other persons in the facility
 to M.
        tuberculosis. The general objectives of the epidemiologic
 investi-
        gations in these situations are as follows:  
            to determine the likelihood that transmission of and
 infection
            with M. tuberculosis has occurred in the facility;  
            to determine the extent to which M. tuberculosis has
 been
            transmitted;  
            to identify those persons who have been exposed and
 infected,
            enabling them to receive appropriate clinical
 management;  
            to identify factors that could have contributed to
 trans-
            mission and infection and to implement appropriate
 interventions;
            and  
            to evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions
 that are
            implemented and to ensure that exposure to and
 transmission of M.
            tuberculosis have been terminated.  The exact circumstances of these situations
are likely to
 vary
        considerably, and the associated epidemiologic
 investigations should
        be tailored to the individual circumstances. The following
 sections
        provide general guidance for conducting these
 investigations.  
            Investigating PPD test conversions and active TB in
 HCWs  
                Investigating PPD test conversions in HCWs  PPD test conversions may be
detected in HCWs as a
 result of
                a contact investigation, in which case the probable
 source of
                exposure and transmission is already known (Section
 II.K.3.),
                or as a result of routine screening, in which case
 the
                probable source of exposure and infection is not
 already
                known and may not be immediately apparent.  If a skin-test conversion in an
HCW is identified
 as part of
                routine screening, the following steps should be
 considered
                (Figure_2 Figure_2c):  
                    The HCW should be evaluated promptly for active
 TB. The
                    initial evaluation should include a thorough
 history,
                    physical examination, and chest radiograph. On
 the basis
                    of the initial evaluation, other diagnostic
 procedures
                    (e.g., sputum examination) may be indicated.  
                    If appropriate, the HCW should be placed on
 preventive or
                    curative therapy in accordance with current
 guidelines
                    (Suppl. 2) (5).  
                    A history of possible exposure to M.
 tuberculosis should
                    be obtained from the HCW to determine the most
 likely
                    source of infection. When the source of
 infection is
                    known, the drug-susceptibility pattern of the
 M. tuber-
                    culosis isolate from the source patient should
 be
                    identified to determine appropriate preventive
 or
                    curative therapy regimens.  
                    If the history suggests that the HCW was
 exposed to and
                    infected with M. tuberculosis outside the
 facility, no
                    further epidemiologic investigation to identify
 a source
                    in the facility is necessary.  
                    If the history does not suggest that the HCW
 was exposed
                    and infected outside the facility but does
 identify a
                    probable source of exposure in the facility,
 contacts of
                    the suspected source patient should be
 identified and
                    evaluated. Possible reasons for the exposure
 and trans-
                    mission should be evaluated (Table_4),
 interventions
                    should be implemented to correct these causes,
 and PPD
                    testing of PPD-negative HCWs should be
 performed
                    immediately and repeated after 3 months.  If no additional PPD test
conversions are
 detected on
                    follow-up testing, the investigation can be
 terminated.  If additional PPD test conversions are detected
 on
                    follow-up testing, the possible reasons for
 exposure and
                    transmission should be reassessed, the
 appropriateness of
                    and degree of adherence to the interventions
 implemented
                    should be evaluated, and PPD testing of
 PPD-negative HCWs
                    should be repeated after another 3 months.  If no additional PPD test
conversions are
 detected on the
                    second round of follow-up testing, the
 investigation can
                    be terminated. However, if additional PPD
 conversions are
                    detected on the second round of follow-up
 testing, a
                    high-risk protocol should be implemented in the
 affected
                    area or occupational group, and the public
 health
                    department or other persons with expertise in
 TB
                    infection control should be consulted.  
                    If the history does not suggest that the HCW
 was exposed
                    to and infected with M. tuberculosis outside
 the facility
                    and does not identify a probable source of
 exposure in
                    the facility, further investigation to identify
 the
                    probable source patient in the facility is
 warranted.  The interval during which the HCW could have
 been
                    infected should be estimated. Generally, this
 would be
                    the interval from 10 weeks before the most
 recent
                    negative PPD test through 2 weeks before the
 first
                    positive PPD test (i.e., the conversion).  Laboratory and infection-control
records should
 be
                    reviewed to identify all patients or HCWs who
 have
                    suspected or confirmed infectious TB and who
 could have
                    transmitted M. tuberculosis to the HCW.  If this process does identify a
likely source
 patient,
                    contacts of the suspected source patient should
 be
                    identified and evaluated, and possible reasons
 for the
                    exposure and transmission should be evaluated
                    (Table_4). Interventions should be
 implemented to
                    correct these causes, and PPD testing of
 PPD-negative
                    HCWs should be repeated after 3 months.
 However, if this
                    process does not identify a probable source
 case, PPD
                    screening results of other HCWs in the same
 area or
                    occupational group should be reviewed for
 additional
                    evidence of M. tuberculosis transmission. If
 sufficient
                    additional PPD screening results are not
 available,
                    appropriate personnel should consider
 conducting
                    additional PPD screening of other HCWs in the
 same area
                    or occupational group.  If this review and/or screening does not
 identify
                    additional PPD conversions, nosocomial
 transmission is
                    less likely, and the contact investigation can
 probably
                    be terminated. Whether the HCW's PPD test
 conversion
                    resulted from occupational exposure and
 infection is
                    uncertain; however, the absence of other data
 implicating
                    nosocomial transmission suggests that the
 conversion
                    could have resulted from a) unrecognized
 exposure to M.
                    tuberculosis outside the facility; b)
 cross-reactivity
                    with another antigen (e.g., nontuberculous
 mycobacteria);
                    c) errors in applying, reading, or interpreting
 the test;
                    d) false positivity caused by the normal
 variability of
                    the test; or e) false positivity caused by a
 defective
                    PPD preparation.  If this review and/or screening does identify
 additional
                    PPD test conversions, nosocomial transmission
 is more
                    likely. In this situation, the patient
 identification
                    (i.e., triage) process, TB infection-control
 policies and
                    practices, and engineering controls should be
 evaluated
                    to identify problems that could have led to
 exposure and
                    transmission (Table_4).  If no such problems are identified, a high-risk
 protocol
                    should be implemented in the affected area or
 occupa-
                    tional group, and the public health department
 or other
                    persons with expertise in TB infection control
 should be
                    consulted.  If such problems are identified, appropriate
 interven-
                    tions should be implemented to correct the
 problem(s),
                    and PPD skin testing of PPD-negative HCWs
 should be
                    repeated after 3 months.  If no additional PPD conversions are detected
 on follow-
                    up testing, the investigation can be
 terminated.  If additional PPD conversions are detected on
 follow-up
                    testing, the possible reasons for exposure and
 trans-
                    mission should be reassessed, the
 appropriateness of and
                    adherence to the interventions implemented
 should be
                    evaluated, and PPD skin testing of PPD-negative
 HCWs
                    should be repeated after another 3 months.  If no additional PPD test
conversions are
 detected on
                    this second round of follow-up testing, the
 investigation
                    can be terminated. However, if additional PPD
 test
                    conversions are detected on the second round of
 follow-up
                    testing, a high-risk protocol should be
 implemented in
                    the affected area or occupational group, and
 the public
                    health department or other persons with
 expertise in TB
                    infection control should be consulted.  
                Investigating cases of active TB in HCWs  If an HCW develops active TB, the
following steps
 should be
                taken:  
                    The case should be evaluated epidemiologically,
 in a
                    manner similar to PPD test conversions in HCWs,
 to
                    determine the likelihood that it resulted from
                    occupational transmission and to identify
 possible causes
                    and implement appropriate interventions if the
 evaluation
                    suggests such transmission.  
                    Contacts of the HCW (e.g., other HCWs,
 patients,
                    visitors, and others who have had intense
 exposure to the
                    HCW) should be identified and evaluated for TB
 infection
                    and disease (Section II.K.3; Suppl. 2). The
 public health
                    department should be notified immediately for
 consul-
                    tation and to allow for investigation of
 community
                    contacts who were not exposed in the
 health-care
                    facility.  
                    The public health department should notify
 facilities
                    when HCWs with TB are reported by physicians so
 that an
                    investigation of contacts can be conducted in
 the
                    facility. The information provided by the
 health depart-
                    ment to facilities should be in accordance with
 state or
                    local laws to protect the confidentiality of
 the HCW.  
            Investigating possible patient-to-patient transmission
 of M.
            tuberculosis  Surveillance of active TB cases in patients should be
 conducted.
            If this surveillance suggests the possibility of
 patient-to-
            patient transmission of M. tuberculosis (e.g., a high
 proportion
            of TB patients had prior admissions during the year
 preceding
            onset of their TB, the number of patients with
 drug-resistant TB
            increased suddenly, or isolates obtained from multiple
 patients
            had identical and characteristic drug-susceptibility or
 DNA
            fingerprint patterns), the following steps should be
 taken:  
                Review the HCW PPD test results and patient
 surveillance data
                for the suspected areas to detect additional
 patients or HCWs
                with PPD test conversions or active disease.  
                Look for possible exposures that patients with
 newly
                diagnosed TB could have had to other TB patients
 during
                previous admissions. For example, were the patients
 admitted
                to the same room or area, or did they receive the
 same
                procedure or go to the same treatment area on the
 same day?  If the evaluation thus far suggests transmission has
 occurred,
                the following steps should be taken:  
                Evaluate possible causes of the transmission (e.g.,
 problem
                with patient detection, institutional barriers to
 imple-
                menting appropriate isolation practices, or
 inadequate
                engineering controls) (Table_4).  
                Ascertain whether other patients or HCWs could have
 been
                exposed; if so, evaluate these persons for TB
 infection and
                disease (Section II.K.3; Suppl. 2).  
                Notify the public health department so they can
 begin a
                community contact investigation if necessary.  
            Investigating contacts of patients and HCWs who have
 infectious
            TB  If a patient who has active TB is examined in a
 health-care
            facility and the illness is not diagnosed correctly,
 resulting in
            failure to apply appropriate precautions, or if an HCW
 develops
            active TB and exposes other persons in the facility,
 the
            following steps should be taken when the illness is
 later
            diagnosed correctly:  
                To identify other patients and HCWs who were
 exposed to the
                source patient before isolation procedures were
 begun,
                interview the source patient and all applicable
 personnel and
                review that patient's medical record. Determine the
 areas of
                the facility in which the source patient was
 hospitalized,
                visited, or worked before being placed in isolation
 (e.g.,
                outpatient clinics, hospital rooms, treatment
 rooms,
                radiology and procedure areas, and patient lounges)
 and the
                HCWs who may have been exposed during that time
 (e.g.,
                persons providing direct care, therapists, clerks,
 transpor-
                tation personnel, housekeepers, and social
 workers).  
                The contact investigation should first determine if
 M.
                tuberculosis transmission has occurred from the
 source
                patient to those persons with whom the source
 patient had the
                most intense contact.  
                Administer PPD tests to the most intensely exposed
 HCWs and
                patients as soon as possible after the exposure has
 occurred.
                If transmission did occur to the most intensely
 exposed
                persons, then those persons with whom the patient
 had less
                contact should be evaluated. If the initial PPD
 test result
                is negative, a second test should be administered
 12 weeks
                after the exposure was terminated.  
                Those persons who were exposed to M. tuberculosis
 and who
                have either a PPD test conversion or symptoms
 suggestive of
                TB should receive prompt clinical evaluation and,
 if
                indicated, chest radiographs and bacteriologic
 studies should
                be performed (Suppl. 2). Those persons who have
 evidence of
                newly acquired infection or active disease should
 be evalu-
                ated for preventive or curative therapy (Suppl. 2).
 Persons
                who have previously had positive PPD test results
 and who
                have been exposed to an infectious TB patient do
 not require
                a repeat PPD test or a chest radiograph unless they
 have
                symptoms suggestive of TB.  
                In addition to PPD testing those HCWs and patients
 who have
                been exposed to M. tuberculosis because a patient
 was not
                isolated promptly or an HCW with active TB was not
 identified
                promptly, the investigation should determine why
 the diag-
                nosis of TB was delayed. If the correct diagnosis
 was made
                but the patient was not isolated promptly, the
 reasons for
                the delay need to be defined so that corrective
 actions can
                be taken.  
        Coordination with the Public Health Department  
            As soon as a patient or HCW is known or suspected to
 have active
            TB, the patient or HCW should be reported to the public
 health
            department so that appropriate follow-up can be
 arranged and a
            community contact investigation can be performed. The
 health
            department should be notified well before patient
 discharge to
            facilitate follow-up and continuation of therapy. A
 discharge
            plan coordinated with the patient or HCW, the health
 department,
            and the inpatient facility should be implemented.  
            The public health department should protect the
 confidentiality
            of the patient or HCW in accordance with state and
 local laws.  
            Health-care facilities and health departments should
 coordinate
            their efforts to perform appropriate contact
 investigations on
            patients and HCWs who have active TB.  
            In accordance with state and local laws and
 regulations, results
            of all AFB-positive sputum smears, cultures positive
 for M.
            tuberculosis, and drug-susceptibility results on M.
 tuberculosis
            isolates should be reported to the public health
 department as
            soon as these results are available.  
            The public health department may be able to assist
 facilities
            with planning and implementing various aspects of a TB
 infection-
            control program (e.g., surveillance, screening
 activities, and
            outbreak investigations). In addition, the state health
 depart-
            ment may be able to provide names of experts to assist
 with the
            engineering aspects of TB infection control.  
        Additional Considerations for Selected Areas in Health-Care
        Facilities  and  Other  Health-Care  Settings   This  section  contains  additional
information for selected
 areas in
        health-care facilities and for other health-care settings.  
            Selected areas in health-care facilities  
                Operating rooms  
                    Elective operative procedures on patients who
 have TB
                    should be delayed until the patient is no
 longer
                    infectious.  
                    If operative procedures must be performed, they
 should be
                    done, if possible, in operating rooms that have
                    anterooms. For operating rooms without
 anterooms, the
                    doors to the operating room should be closed,
 and traffic
                    into and out of the room should be minimal to
 reduce the
                    frequency of opening and closing the door.
 Attempts
                    should be made to perform the procedure at a
 time when
                    other patients are not present in the operative
 suite and
                    when a minimum number of personnel are present
 (e.g., at
                    the end of day).  
                    Placing a bacterial filter on the patient
 endotracheal
                    tube (or at the expiratory side of the
 breathing circuit
                    of a ventilator or anesthesia machine if these
 are used)
                    when operating on a patient who has confirmed
 or
                    suspected TB may help reduce the risk for
 contaminating
                    anesthesia equipment or discharging tubercle
 bacilli into
                    the ambient air.  
                    During postoperative recovery, the patient
 should be
                    monitored and should be placed in a private
 room that
                    meets recommended standards for ventilating TB
 isolation
                    rooms.  
                    When operative procedures (or other procedures
 requiring
                    a sterile field) are performed on patients who
 may have
                    infectious TB, respiratory protection worn by
 the HCW
                    must protect the field from the respiratory
 secretions of
                    the HCW and protect the HCW from the infectious
 droplet
                    nuclei generated by the patient. Valved or
 positive-
                    pressure respirators do not protect the sterile
 field;
                    therefore, a respirator that does not have a
 valve and
                    that meets the criteria in Section II.G should
 be used.  
                Autopsy rooms  
                    Because infectious aerosols are likely to be
 present in
                    autopsy rooms, such areas should be at negative
 pressure
                    with respect to adjacent areas (Suppl. 3), and
 the room
                    air should be exhausted directly to the outside
 of the
                    building. ASHRAE recommends that autopsy rooms
 have
                    ventilation that provides an airflow of 12 ACH
 (47),
                    although the effectiveness of this ventilation
 level in
                    reducing the risk for M. tuberculosis
 transmission has
                    not been evaluated. Where possible, this level
 should be
                    increased by means of ventilation system design
 or by
                    auxiliary methods (e.g., recirculation of air
 within the
                    room through HEPA filters) (Suppl. 3).  
                    Respiratory protection should be worn by
 personnel while
                    performing autopsies on deceased persons who
 may have had
                    TB at the time of death (Section II.G; Suppl.
 4).  
                    Recirculation of HEPA-filtered air within the
 room or
                    UVGI may be used as a supplement to the
 recommended
                    ventilation (Suppl. 3).  
                Laboratories  
                    Laboratories in which specimens for
 mycobacteriologic
                    studies (e.g., AFB smears and cultures) are
 processed
                    should be designed to conform with criteria
 specified by
                    CDC and the National Institutes of Health (59).
  
            Other health-care settings  TB precautions may be appropriate in a number of
other
 types of
            health-care settings. The specific precautions that are
 applied
            will vary depending on the setting. At a minimum, a
 risk
            assessment should be performed yearly for these
 settings; a
            written TB infection-control plan should be developed,
 evaluated,
            and revised on a regular basis; protocols should be in
 place for
            identifying and managing patients who may have active
 TB; HCWs
            should receive appropriate training, education, and
 screening;
            protocols for problem evaluation should be in place;
 and coordin-
            ation with the public health department should be
 arranged when
            necessary. Other recommendations specific to certain of
 these
            settings follow.  
                Emergency medical services  
                    When EMS personnel or others must transport
 patients who
                    have confirmed or suspected active TB, a
 surgical mask
                    should be placed, if possible, over the
 patient's mouth
                    and nose. Because administrative and
 engineering controls
                    during emergency transport situations cannot be
 ensured,
                    EMS personnel should wear respiratory
 protection when
                    transporting such patients. If feasible, the
 windows of
                    the vehicle should be kept open. The heating
 and air-
                    conditioning system should be set on a
 nonrecirculating
                    cycle.  
                    EMS personnel should be included in a
 comprehensive PPD
                    screening program and should receive a baseline
 PPD test
                    and follow-up testing as indicated by the risk
 assess-
                    ment. They should also be included in the
 follow-up of
                    contacts of a patient with infectious TB.

                Hospices  
                    Hospice patients who have confirmed or
 suspected TB
                    should be managed in the manner described in
 this
                    document for management of TB patients in
 hospitals.
                    General-use and specialized areas (e.g.,
 treatment or TB
                    isolation rooms) should be ventilated in the
 same manner
                    as described for similar hospital areas.  
                Long-term care facilities  
                    Recommendations published previously for
 preventing and
                    controlling TB in long-term care facilities
 should be
                    followed (60).  
                    Long-term care facilities should also follow
 the recom-
                    mendations outlined in this document.  
                Correctional facilities  
                    Recommendations published previously for
 preventing and
                    controlling TB in correctional facilities
 should be
                    followed (61).  
                    Prison medical facilities should also follow
 the recom-
                    mendations outlined in this document.  
                Dental settings  In general, the symptoms for which patients seek
 treatment in
                a dental-care setting are not likely to be caused
 by
                infectious TB. Unless a patient requiring dental
 care
                coincidentally has TB, it is unlikely that
 infectious TB will
                be encountered in the dental setting. Furthermore,
 generation
                of droplet nuclei containing M. tuberculosis during
 dental
                procedures has not been demonstrated (62).
 Therefore, the
                risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis in most
 dental
                settings is probably quite low. Nevertheless,
 during dental
                procedures, patients and dental workers share the
 same air
                for varying periods of time. Coughing may be
 stimulated
                occasionally by oral manipulations, although no
 specific
                dental procedures have been classified as
 "cough-inducing."
                In some instances, the population served by a
 dental-care
                facility, or the HCWs in the facility, may be at
 relatively
                high risk for TB. Because the potential exists for
 trans-
                mission of M. tuberculosis in dental settings, the
 following
                recommendations should be followed:  
                    A risk assessment (Section II.B) should be done
 period-
                    ically, and TB infection-control policies for
 each dental
                    setting should be based on the risk assessment.
 The
                    policies should include provisions for
 detection and
                    referral of patients who may have undiagnosed
 active TB;
                    management of patients with active TB, relative
 to
                    provision of urgent dental care; and
 employer-sponsored
                    HCW education, counseling, and screening.  
                    While taking patients' initial medical
 histories and at
                    periodic updates, dental HCWs should routinely
 ask all
                    patients whether they have a history of TB
 disease and
                    symptoms suggestive of TB.  
                    Patients with a medical history or symptoms
 suggestive of
                    undiagnosed active TB should be referred
 promptly for
                    medical evaluation of possible infectiousness.
 Such
                    patients should not remain in the dental-care
 facility
                    any longer than required to arrange a referral.
 While in
                    the dental-care facility, they should wear
 surgical masks
                    and should be instructed to cover their mouths
 and noses
                    when coughing or sneezing.  
                    Elective dental treatment should be deferred
 until a
                    physician confirms that the patient does not
 have
                    infectious TB. If the patient is diagnosed as
 having
                    active TB, elective dental treatment should be
 deferred
                    until the patient is no longer infectious.  
                    If urgent dental care must be provided for a
 patient who
                    has, or is strongly suspected of having,
 infectious TB,
                    such care should be provided in facilities that
 can
                    provide TB isolation (Sections II.E and G).
 Dental HCWs
                    should use respiratory protection while
 performing
                    procedures on such patients.  
                    Any dental HCW who has a persistent cough
 (i.e., a cough
                    lasting greater than or equal to 3 weeks),
 especially in
                    the presence of other signs or symptoms
 compatible with
                    active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats,
 bloody
                    sputum, anorexia, and fever), should be
 evaluated
                    promptly for TB. The HCW should not return to
 the work-
                    place until a diagnosis of TB has been excluded
 or until
                    the HCW is on therapy and a determination has
 been made
                    that the HCW is noninfectious.  
                    In dental-care facilities that provide care to
 popula-
                    tions at high risk for active TB, it may be
 appropriate
                    to use engineering controls similar to those
 used in
                    general-use areas (e.g., waiting rooms) of
 medical
                    facilities that have a similar risk profile.  
                Home-health-care settings  
                    HCWs who provide medical services in the homes
 of
                    patients who have suspected or confirmed
 infectious TB
                    should instruct such patients to cover their
 mouths and
                    noses with a tissue when coughing or sneezing.
 Until such
                    patients are no longer infectious, HCWs should
 wear
                    respiratory protection when entering these
 patients'
                    homes (Suppl. 4).  
                    Precautions in the home may be discontinued
 when the
                    patient is no longer infectious (Suppl. 1).  
                    HCWs who provide health-care services in their
 patients'
                    homes can assist in preventing transmission of
 M. tuber-
                    culosis by educating their patients regarding
 the impor-
                    tance of taking medications as prescribed and
 by admin-
                    istering DOT.  
                    Cough-inducing procedures performed on patients
 who have
                    infectious TB should not be done in the
 patients' homes
                    unless absolutely necessary. When medically
 necessary
                    cough-inducing procedures (e.g., AFB sputum
 collection
                    for evaluation of therapy) must be performed on
 patients
                    who may have infectious TB, the procedures
 should be
                    performed in a health-care facility in a room
 or booth
                    that has the recommended ventilation for such
 procedures.
                    If these procedures must be performed in a
 patient's
                    home, they should be performed in a
 well-ventilated area
                    away from other household members. If feasible,
 the HCW
                    should consider opening a window to improve
 ventilation
                    or collecting the specimen while outside the
 dwelling.
                    The HCW collecting these specimens should wear
 respir-
                    atory protection during the procedure (Section
 II.G).  
                    HCWs who provide medical services in their
 patients'
                    homes should be included in comprehensive
 employer-
                    sponsored TB training, education, counseling,
 and
                    screening programs. These programs should
 include
                    provisions for identifying HCWs who have active
 TB,
                    baseline PPD skin testing, and follow-up PPD
 testing at
                    intervals appropriate to the degree of risk.  
                    Patients who are at risk for developing active
 TB and the
                    HCWs who provide medical services in the homes
 of such
                    patients should be reminded periodically of the
 impor-
                    tance of having pulmonary symptoms evaluated
 promptly to
                    permit early detection of and treatment for TB.
  
                Medical offices  In general, the symptoms of active TB are symptoms
 for which
                patients are likely to seek treatment in a medical
 office.
                Furthermore, the populations served by some medical
 offices,
                or the HCWs in the office, may be at relatively
 high risk for
                TB. Thus, it is likely that infectious TB will be
 encountered
                in a medical office. Because of the potential for
 M. tuber-
                culosis transmission, the following recommendations
 should be
                observed:  
                    A risk assessment should be conducted
 periodically, and
                    TB infection-control policies based on results
 of the
                    risk assessment should be developed for the
 medical
                    office. The policies should include provisions
 for
                    identifying and managing patients who may have
 undiag-
                    nosed active TB; managing patients who have
 active TB;
                    and educating, training, counseling, and
 screening HCWs.  
                    While taking patients' initial medical
 histories and at
                    periodic updates, HCWs who work in medical
 offices should
                    routinely ask all patients whether they have a
 history of
                    TB disease or have had symptoms suggestive of
 TB.  
                    Patients with a medical history and symptoms
 suggestive
                    of active TB should receive an appropriate
 diagnostic
                    evaluation for TB and be evaluated promptly for
 possible
                    infectiousness. Ideally, this evaluation should
 be done
                    in a facility that has TB isolation capability.
 At a
                    minimum, the patient should be provided with
 and asked to
                    wear a surgical mask, instructed to cover the
 mouth and
                    nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing,
 and
                    separated as much as possible from other
 patients.  
                    Medical offices that provide evaluation or
 treatment
                    services for TB patients should follow the
 recommen-
                    dations for managing patients in
 ambulatory-care settings
                    (Section II.D).  
                    If cough-inducing procedures are to be
 administered in a
                    medical office to patients who may have active
 TB,
                    appropriate precautions should be followed
 (Section
                    II.H).  
                    Any HCW who has a persistent cough (i.e., a
 cough lasting
                    greater than or equal to 3 weeks), especially
 in the
                    presence of other signs or symptoms compatible
 with
                    active TB (e.g., weight loss, night sweats,
 bloody
                    sputum, anorexia, or fever) should be evaluated
 promptly
                    for TB. HCWs with such signs or symptoms should
 not
                    return to the workplace until a diagnosis of TB
 has been
                    excluded or until they are on therapy and a
 determination
                    has been made that they are noninfectious.  
                    HCWs who work in medical offices in which there
 is a
                    likelihood of exposure to patients who have
 infectious TB
                    should be included in employer-sponsored
 education,
                    training, counseling, and PPD testing programs
 appro-
                    priate to the level of risk in the office.  
                    In medical offices that provide care to
 populations at
                    relatively high risk for active TB, use of
 engineering
                    controls as described in this document for
 general-use
                    areas (e.g., waiting rooms) may be appropriate
 (Section
                    II.F; Suppl. 3).  Supplement 1: Determining the Infectiousness of a TB
Patient  The infectiousness of patients with TB correlates with the number
 of
organisms expelled into the air, which, in turn, correlates with
 the
following factors: a) disease in the lungs, airways, or larynx; b)
 presence
of cough or other forceful expiratory measures; c) presence of
 acid-fast
bacilli (AFB) in the sputum; d) failure of the patient to cover the
 mouth and
nose when coughing; e) presence of cavitation on chest radiograph;
 f)
inappropriate or short duration of chemotherapy; and g)
 administration of
procedures that can induce coughing or cause aerosolization of M.
tuberculosis (e.g., sputum induction).  The most infectious persons are most likely those
who have not been
 treated
for TB and who have either a) pulmonary or laryngeal TB and a cough
 or are
undergoing cough-inducing procedures, b) a positive AFB sputum
 smear, or c)
cavitation on chest radiograph. Persons with extrapulmonary TB
 usually are
not infectious unless they have a) concomitant pulmonary disease;
 b)
nonpulmonary disease located in the respiratory tract or oral
 cavity; or c)
extrapulmonary disease that includes an open abscess or lesion in
 which the
concentration of organisms is high, especially if drainage from the
 abscess
or lesion is extensive (20,22). Coinfection with HIV does not
 appear to
affect the infectiousness of TB patients (63-65).  In general, children who have TB may
be less likely than adults to
 be
infectious; however, transmission from children can occur.
 Therefore,
children with TB should be evaluated for infectiousness using the
 same
parameters as for adults (i.e., pulmonary or laryngeal TB, presence
 of cough
or cough-inducing procedures, positive sputum AFB smear, cavitation
 on chest
radiograph, and adequacy and duration of therapy). Pediatric
 patients who may
be infectious include those who a) are not on therapy, b) have just
 been
started on therapy, or c) are on inadequate therapy, and who a)
 have
laryngeal or extensive pulmonary involvement, b) have pronounced
 cough or are
undergoing cough-inducing procedures, c) have positive sputum AFB
 smears, or
d) have cavitary TB. Children who have typical primary tuberculous
 lesions
and do not have any of the indicators of infectiousness listed
 previously
usually do not need to be placed in isolation. Because the source
 case for
pediatric TB patients often occurs in a member of the infected
 child's family
(45), parents and other visitors of all pediatric TB patients
 should be
evaluated for TB as soon as possible.  Infection is most likely to result from exposure to
persons who
 have
unsuspected pulmonary TB and are not receiving anti-TB therapy or
 from
persons who have diagnosed TB and are not receiving adequate
 therapy.
Administration of effective anti-TB therapy has been associated
 with
decreased infectiousness among persons who have active TB (66).
 Effective
therapy reduces coughing, the amount of sputum produced, and the
 number of
organisms in the sputum. However, the period of time a patient must
 take
effective therapy before becoming noninfectious varies between
 patients (67).
For example, some TB patients are never infectious, whereas those
 with
unrecognized or inadequately treated drug-resistant TB may remain
 infectious
for weeks or months (24). Thus, decisions about infectiousness
 should be made
on an individual basis.  In general, patients who have suspected or confirmed active TB
 should be
considered infectious if they a) are coughing, b) are undergoing
 cough-
inducing procedures, or c) have positive AFB sputum smears, and if
 they a)
are not on chemotherapy, b) have just started chemotherapy, or c)
 have a poor
clinical or bacteriologic response to chemotherapy. A patient who
 has drug-
susceptible TB and who is on adequate chemotherapy and has had a
 significant
clinical and bacteriologic response to therapy (i.e., reduction in
 cough,
resolution of fever, and progressively decreasing quantity of
 bacilli on
smear) is probably no longer infectious. However, because
 drug-susceptibility
results are not usually known when the decision to discontinue
 isolation is
made, all TB patients should remain in isolation while hospitalized
 until
they have had three consecutive negative sputum smears collected on
 different
days  and  they  demonstrate  clinical  improvement.   Supplement  2:  Diagnosis  and
Treatment of Latent TB Infection and
Active TB  
    Diagnostic  Procedures  for  TB  Infection  and  Disease   A  diagnosis  of  TB  may  be
considered for any patient who has a
 persistent
cough (i.e., a cough lasting greater than or equal to 3 weeks)
 or other
signs or symptoms compatible with TB (e.g., bloody sputum,
 night sweats,
weight loss, anorexia, or fever). However, the index of
 suspicion for TB
will vary in different geographic areas and will depend on the
 prevalence
of TB and other characteristics of the population served by the
 facility.
The index of suspicion for TB should be very high in areas or
 among
groups of patients in which the prevalence of TB is high
 (Section I.B).
Persons for whom a diagnosis of TB is being considered should
 receive
appropriate diagnostic tests, which may include PPD skin
 testing, chest
radiography, and bacteriologic studies (e.g., sputum microscopy
 and
culture).  
    PPD Skin Testing and Anergy Testing  
        Application and reading of PPD skin tests  The PPD skin test is the only method
available for
 demonstrating
        infection with M. tuberculosis. Although currently
 available PPD
        tests are less than 100% sensitive and specific for
 detection of
        infection with M. tuberculosis, no better diagnostic
 methods have
        yet been devised. Interpretation of PPD test results
 requires
        knowledge of the antigen used, the immunologic basis
 for the
        reaction to this antigen, the technique used to
 administer and
        read the test, and the results of epidemiologic and
 clinical
        experience with the test (2,5,6). The PPD test, like
 all medical
        tests, is subject to variability, but many of the
 variations in
        administering and reading PPD tests can be avoided by
 proper
        training  and  careful  attention  to  details.   The  intracutaneous  (Mantoux)
administration of a
 measured amount
        of PPD-tuberculin is currently the preferred method for
 doing the
        test. One-tenth milliliter of PPD (5 TU) is injected
 just beneath
        the surface of the skin on either the volar or dorsal
 surface of
        the forearm. A discrete, pale elevation of the skin
 (i.e., a
        wheal) that is 6-10 mm in diameter should be produced.  PPD test results should
be read by designated, trained
 personnel
        between 48 and 72 hours after injection. Patient or HCW
 self-
        reading of PPD test results should not be accepted
 (68). The
        result of the test is based on the presence or absence
 of an
        induration at the injection site. Redness or erythema
 should not
        be measured. The transverse diameter of induration
 should be
        recorded in millimeters.  
        Interpretation of PPD skin tests  
            General  The interpretation of a PPD reaction should be
 influenced by
            the purpose for which the test was given (e.g.,
 epidemiologic
            versus diagnostic purposes), by the prevalence of
 TB
            infection in the population being tested, and by
 the
            consequences of false classification. Errors in
 classifi-
            cation can be minimized by establishing an
 appropriate
            definition of a positive reaction (Table_S21).  The positive-predictive value of
PPD tests (i.e,
 the
            probability that a person with a positive PPD test
 is
            actually infected with M. tuberculosis) is
 dependent on the
            prevalence of TB infection in the population being
 tested and
            the specificity of the test (69,70). In populations
 with a
            low prevalence of TB infection, the probability
 that a
            positive PPD test represents true infection with M.
 tuber-
            culosis is very low if the cut-point is set too low
 (i.e.,
            the test is not adequately specific). In
 populations with a
            high prevalence of TB infection, the probability
 that a
            positive PPD test using the same cut-point
 represents true
            infection with M. tuberculosis is much higher. To
 ensure that
            few persons infected with tubercle bacilli will be
 misclas-
            sified as having negative reactions and few persons
 not
            infected with tubercle bacilli will be
 misclassified as
            having positive reactions, different cut-points are
 used to
            separate positive reactions from negative reactions
 for
            different populations, depending on the risk for TB
 infection
            in that population.  A lower cut-point (i.e., 5 mm) is used for persons
 in the
            highest risk groups, which include HIV-infected
 persons,
            recent close contacts of persons with TB (e.g., in
 the
            household or in an unprotected occupational
 exposure similar
            in intensity and duration to household contact),
 and persons
            who have abnormal chest radiographs with fibrotic
 changes
            consistent with inactive TB. A higher cut-point
 (i.e., 10 mm)
            is used for persons who are not in the highest risk
 group but
            who have other risk factors (e.g., injecting-drug
 users known
            to be HIV seronegative; persons with certain
 medical condi-
            tions that increase the risk for progression from
 latent TB
            infection to active TB {Table_S21}); medically
 under-
            served, low-income populations; persons born in
 foreign
            countries that have a high prevalence of TB; and
 residents of
            correc-tional institutions and nursing homes). An
 even higher
            cut-point (i.e., 15 mm) is used for all other
 persons who
            have none of the above risk factors.  Recent PPD converters are considered
members of a
 high-risk
            group. A greater than or equal to 10 mm increase in
 the size
            of the induration within a 2-year period is
 classified as a
            conversion from a negative to a positive test
 result for
            persons less than 35 years of age. An increase of
 induration
            of greater than or equal to 15 mm within a 2-year
 period is
            classified as a conversion for persons greater than
 or equal
            to 35 years of age (5).  
            HCWs  In general, HCWs should have their skin-test
 results inter-
            preted according to the recommendations in this
 supplement
            and in sections 1, 2, 3, and 5 of Table_S21.
 However, the
            prevalence of TB in the facility should be
 considered when
            choosing the appropriate cut-point for defining a
 positive
            PPD reaction. In facilities where there is
 essen-tially no
            risk for exposure to TB patients (i.e., minimal- or
 very low-
            risk facilities {Section II.B}), an induration
 greater than
            or equal to 15 mm may be an appropriate cut-point
 for HCWs
            who have no other risk factors. In other facilities
 where TB
            patients receive care, the appropriate cut-point
 for HCWs who
            have no other risk factors may be greater than or
 equal to 10
            mm.  A recent PPD test conversion in an HCW should be
 defined
            generally as an increase of greater than or equal
 to 10 mm in
            the size of induration within a 2-year period. For
 HCWs in
            facilities where exposure to TB is very unlikely
 (e.g.,
            minimal-risk facilities), an increase of greater
 than or
            equal to 15 mm within a 2-year period may be more
 appropriate
            for defining a recent conversion because of the
 lower
            positive-predictive value of the test in such
 groups.  
        Anergy testing  HIV-infected persons may have suppressed reactions to
 PPD skin
        tests because of anergy, particularly if their CD4+
 T-lymphocyte
        counts decline (71). Persons with anergy will have a
 negative PPD
        test regardless of infection with M. tuberculosis.
 HIV-infected
        persons should be evaluated for anergy in conjunction
 with PPD
        testing (72). Two companion antigens (e.g., Candida
 antigen and
        tetanus toxoid) should be administered in addition to
 PPD.
        Persons with greater than or equal to 3 mm of
 induration to any
        of the skin tests (including tuberculin) are considered
 not
        anergic. Reactions of greater than or equal to 5 mm to
 PPD are
        considered to be evidence of TB infection in
 HIV-infected persons
        regardless of the reactions to the companion antigens.
 If there
        is no reaction (i.e., less than 3 mm induration) to any
 of the
        antigens, the person being tested is considered
 anergic. Deter-
        mination of whether such persons are likely to be
 infected with
        M. tuberculosis must be based on other epidemiologic
 factors
        (e.g., the proportion of other persons with the same
 level of
        exposure who have positive PPD test results and the
 intensity or
        duration of exposure to infectious TB patients that the
 anergic
        person experienced).  
        Pregnancy  and  PPD  skin  testing   Although  thousands  (perhaps  millions)  of
pregnant women
 have been
        PPD skin tested since the test was devised, thus far no
 docu-
        mented episodes of fetal harm have resulted from use of
 the
        tuberculin test (73). Pregnancy should not exclude a
 female HCW
        from being skin tested as part of a contact
 investigation or as
        part of a regular skin-testing program.  
        BCG  vaccination  and  PPD  skin  testing   BCG  vaccination  may  produce  a  PPD
reaction that cannot
 be
        distinguished reliably from a reaction caused by
 infection with
        M. tuberculosis. For a person who was vaccinated with
 BCG, the
        probability that a PPD test reaction results from
 infection with
        M. tuberculosis increases a) as the size of the
 reaction
        increases, b) when the person is a contact of a person
 with TB,
        c) when the person's country of origin has a high
 prevalence of
        TB, and d) as the length of time between vaccination
 and PPD
        testing increases. For example, a PPD test reaction of
 greater
        than or equal to 10 mm probably can be attributed to M.
 tuber-
        culosis infection in an adult who was vaccinated with
 BCG as a
        child and who is from a country with a high prevalence
 of TB
        (74,75).  
        The booster phenomenon  The ability of persons who have TB infection to react
 to PPD may
        gradually wane. For example, if tested with PPD, adults
 who were
        infected during their childhood may have a negative
 reaction.
        However, the PPD could boost the hypersensitivity, and
 the size
        of the reaction could be larger on a subsequent test.
 This
        boosted reaction may be misinterpreted as a PPD test
 conversion
        from a newly acquired infection. Misinterpretation of a
 boosted
        reaction as a new infection could result in unnecessary
 investi-
        gations of laboratory and patient records in an attempt
 to
        identify the source case and in unnecessary
 prescription of
        preventive therapy for HCWs. Although boosting can
 occur among
        persons in any age group, the likelihood of the
 reaction
        increases with the age of the person being tested
 (6,76).  When PPD testing of adults is to be repeated
 periodically (as in
        HCW skin-testing programs), two-step testing can be
 used to
        reduce the likelihood that a boosted reaction is
 misinterpreted
        as a new infection. Two-step testing should be
 performed on all
        newly employed HCWs who have an initial negative PPD
 test result
        at the time of employment and have not had a documented
 negative
        PPD test result during the 12 months preceding the
 initial test.
        A second test should be performed 1-3 weeks after the
 first test.
        If the second test result is positive, this is most
 likely a
        boosted reaction, and the HCW should be classified as
 previously
        infected. If the second test result remains negative,
 the HCW is
        classified as uninfected, and a positive reaction to a
 subsequent
        test is likely to represent a new infection with M.
 tuberculosis.  
    Chest Radiography  Patients who have positive skin-test results or symptoms
 suggestive
    of TB should be evaluated with a chest radiograph
 regardless of PPD
    test results. Radiographic abnormalities that strongly
 suggest active
    TB include upper-lobe infiltration, particularly if
 cavitation is
    seen (77), and patchy or nodular infiltrates in the apical
 or
    subapical posterior upper lobes or the superior segment of
 the lower
    lobe. If abnormalities are noted, or if the patient has
 symptoms
    suggestive of extrapulmonary TB, additional diagnostic
 tests should
    be conducted.  The radiographic presentation of pulmonary TB in
 HIV-infected
    patients may be unusual (78). Typical apical cavitary
 disease is less
    common among such patients. They may have infiltrates in
 any lung
    zone, a finding that is often associated with mediastinal
 and/or
    hilar adenopathy, or they may have a normal chest
 radiograph,
    although this latter finding occurs rarely.  
    Bacteriology  Smear and culture examination of at least three sputum
 specimens
    collected on different days is the main diagnostic
 procedure for
    pulmonary TB (6). Sputum smears that fail to demonstrate
 AFB do not
    exclude the diagnosis of TB. In the United States,
 approximately 60%
    of patients with positive sputum cultures have positive AFB
 sputum
    smears. HIV-infected patients who have pulmonary TB may be
 less
    likely than immunocompetent patients to have AFB present on
 sputum
    smears, which is consistent with the lower frequency of
 cavitary
    pulmonary disease observed among HIV-infected persons
 (39,41).  Specimens for smear and culture should contain an adequate
 amount of
    expectorated sputum but not much saliva. If a diagnosis of
 TB cannot
    be established from sputum, a bronchoscopy may be necessary
 (36,37).
    In young children who cannot produce an adequate amount of
 sputum,
    gastric aspirates may provide an adequate specimen for
 diagnosis.  A culture of sputum or other clinical specimen that
 contains M.
    tuberculosis provides a definitive diagnosis of TB.
 Conventional
    laboratory methods may require 4-8 weeks for species
 identification;
    however, the use of radiometric culture techniques and
 nucleic acid
    probes facilitates more rapid detection and identification
 of
    mycobacteria (79,80). Mixed mycobacterial infection, either
    simultaneous or sequential, can obscure the identification
 of M.
    tuberculosis during the clinical evaluation and the
 laboratory
    analysis (42). The use of nucleic acid probes for both M.
 avium
    complex and M. tuberculosis may be useful for identifying
 mixed
    mycobacterial  infections  in  clinical  specimens.   Preventive  Therapy  for  Latent  TB
Infection and Treatment of
 Active TB  
    Preventive  Therapy  for  Latent  TB  Infection   Determining  whether  a  person  with  a
positive PPD test
 reaction or
    conversion is a candidate for preventive therapy must be
 based on a)
    the likelihood that the reaction represents true infection
 with M.
    tuberculosis (as determined by the cut-points), b) the
 estimated risk
    for progression from latent infection to active TB, and c)
 the risk
    for hepatitis associated with taking isoniazid (INH)
 preventive
    therapy  (as  determined  by  age  and  other  factors).   HCWs  with  positive  PPD  test
results should be evaluated for
 preven-
    tive therapy regardless of their ages if they a) are recent
    converters, b) are close contacts of persons who have
 active TB, c)
    have a medical condition that increases the risk for TB, d)
 have HIV
    infection, or e) use injecting drugs (5). HCWs with
 positive PPD test
    results who do not have these risk factors should be
 evaluated for
    preventive therapy if they are less than 35 years of age.  Preventive therapy should
be considered for anergic persons
 who are
    known contacts of infectious TB patients and for persons
 from
    populations in which the prevalence of TB infection is very
 high
    (e.g.,  a  prevalence  of  greater  than  10%).   Because  the  risk  for  INH-associated
hepatitis may be
 increased during
    the peripartum period, the decision to use preventive
 therapy during
    pregnancy should be made on an individual basis and should
 depend on
    the patient's estimated risk for progression to active
 disease. In
    general, preventive therapy can be delayed until after
 delivery.
    However, for pregnant women who were probably infected
 recently or
    who have high-risk medical conditions, especially HIV
 infection, INH
    preventive therapy should begin when the infection is
 documented
    (81-84). No evidence suggests that INH poses a carcinogenic
 risk to
    humans (85-87).  The usual preventive therapy regimen is oral INH 300 mg
 daily for
    adults and 10 mg/kg/day for children (88). The recommended
 duration
    of therapy is 12 months for persons with HIV infection and
 9 months
    for children. Other persons should receive INH therapy for
 6-12
    months. For persons who have silicosis or a chest
 radiograph
    demonstrating inactive fibrotic lesions and who have no
 evidence of
    active TB, acceptable regimens include a) 4 months of INH
 plus
    rifampin or b) 12 months of INH, providing that infection
 with INH-
    resistant organisms is unlikely (33). For persons likely to
 be
    infected with MDR-TB, alternative multidrug preventive
 therapy
    regimens  should  be  considered  (89).   All  persons  placed  on  preventive  therapy
should be educated
 regarding
    the possible adverse reactions associated with INH use, and
 they
    should be questioned carefully at monthly intervals by
 qualified
    personnel for signs or symptoms consistent with liver
 damage or other
    adverse effects (81-84,88,90,91). Because INH-associated
 hepatitis
    occurs more frequently among persons greater than 35 years
 of age, a
    transaminase measurement should be obtained from persons in
 this age
    group before initiation of INH therapy and then obtained
 monthly
    until treatment has been completed. Other factors
 associated with an
    increased risk for hepatitis include daily alcohol use,
 chronic liver
    disease, and injecting-drug use. In addition, postpubertal
 black and
    Hispanic women may be at greater risk for hepatitis or drug
    interactions (92). More careful clinical monitoring of
 persons with
    these risk factors and possibly more frequent laboratory
 monitoring
    should be considered. If any of these tests exceeds three
 to five
    times the upper limit of normal, discontinuation of INH
 should be
    strongly considered. Liver function tests are not a
 substitute for
    monthly clinical evaluations or for the prompt assessment
 of signs or
    symptoms of adverse reactions that could occur between the
 regularly
    scheduled evaluations (33).  Persons who have latent TB infection should be advised
that
 they can
    be reinfected with another strain of M. tuberculosis (93).  
    Treatment  of  Patients  Who  Have  Active  TB   Drug-susceptibility  testing  should  be
performed on all
 initial
    isolates from patients with TB. However, test results may
 not be
    available for several weeks, making selection of an initial
 regimen
    difficult, especially in areas where drug-resistant TB has
 been
    documented. Current recommendations for therapy and dosage
 schedules
    for the treatment of drug-susceptible TB should be followed
    (Table_S22; Table_S23) (43). Streptomycin is
 contraindicated
    in the treatment of pregnant women because of the risk for
 ototoxi-
    city to the fetus. In geographic areas or facilities in
 which drug-
    resistant TB is highly prevalent, the initial treatment
 regimen used
    while results of drug-susceptibility tests are pending may
 need to be
    expanded. This decision should be based on analysis of
 surveil-lance
    data.  When results from drug-susceptibility tests become
 available, the
    regimen should be adjusted appropriately (94-97). If drug
 resistance
    is present, clinicians unfamiliar with the management of
 patients
    with  drug-resistant  TB  should  seek  expert  consultation.   For  any  regimen  to  be
effective, adherence to the regimen
 must be
    ensured. The most effective method of ensuring adherence is
 the use
    of DOT after the patient has been discharged from the
 hospital
    (43,91). This practice should be coordinated with the
 public health
    department.  Supplement 3: Engineering Controls  
    Introduction  This supplement provides information regarding the use of
 ventilation
(Section II) and UVGI (Section III) for preventing the
 transmission of M.
tuberculosis in health-care facilities. The information
 provided is
primarily conceptual and is intended to educate staff in the
 health-care
facility concerning engineering controls and how these controls
 can be
used as part of the TB infection-control program. This
 supplement should
not be used in place of consultation with experts, who can
 assume respon-
sibility for advising on ventilation system design and
 selection, instal-
lation, and maintenance of equipment.  The recommendations for engineering controls
include a) local
 exhaust
ventilation (i.e., source control), b) general ventilation, and
 c) air
cleaning. General ventilation considerations include a)
 dilution and
removal of contaminants, b) airflow patterns within rooms, c)
 airflow
direction in facilities, d) negative pressure in rooms, and e)
 TB
isolation rooms. Air cleaning or disinfection can be
 accomplished by
filtration  of  air  (e.g.,  through  HEPA  filters)  or  by  UVGI.   II.  Ventilation   Ventilation
systems for health-care facilities should be
 designed, and
modified when necessary, by ventilation engineers in
 collaboration with
infection-control and occupational health staff.
 Recommendations for
designing and operating ventilation systems have been published
 by ASHRAE
(47), AIA (48), and the American Conference of Governmental
 Industrial
Hygienists, Inc. (98).  As part of the TB infection-control plan, health-care facility
 personnel
should determine the number of TB isolation rooms, treatment
 rooms, and
local exhaust devices (i.e., for cough-inducing or
 aerosol-generating
procedures) that the facility needs. The locations of these
 rooms and
devices will depend on where in the facility the ventilation
 conditions
recommended in this document can be achieved. Grouping
 isolation rooms
together in one area of the facility may facilitate the care of
 TB
patients and the installation and maintenance of optimal
 engineering
controls (particularly ventilation).  Periodic evaluations of the ventilation system should
review
 the number
of TB isolation rooms, treatment rooms, and local exhaust
 devices needed
and the regular maintenance and monitoring of the local and
 general
exhaust systems (including HEPA filtration systems if they are
 used).  The various types and conditions of ventilation systems in
 health-care
facilities and the individual needs of these facilities
 preclude the
ability to provide specific instructions regarding the
 implementation of
these recommendations. Engineering control methods must be
 tailored to
each facility on the basis of need and the feasibility of using
 the
ventilation and air-cleaning concepts discussed in this
 supplement.  
    Local Exhaust Ventilation  Purpose: To capture airborne contaminants at or near their
 source
    (i.e., the source control method) and remove these
 contaminants
    without exposing persons in the area to infectious agents
 (98).  Source control techniques can prevent or reduce the spread
 of
    infectious droplet nuclei into the general air circulation
 by
    entrapping infectious droplet nuclei as they are being
 emitted by the
    patient (i.e., the source). These techniques are especially
 important
    when performing procedures likely to generate aerosols
 containing
    infectious particles and when infectious TB patients are
 coughing or
    sneezing.  Local exhaust ventilation is a preferred source control
 technique,
    and it is often the most efficient way to contain airborne
 contam-
    inants because it captures these contaminants near their
 source
    before they can disperse. Therefore, the technique should
 be used, if
    feasible, wherever aerosol-generating procedures are
 performed. Two
    basic types of local exhaust devices use hoods: a) the
 enclosing
    type, in which the hood either partially or fully encloses
 the
    infectious source; and b) the exterior type, in which the
 infectious
    source is near but outside the hood. Fully enclosed hoods,
 booths, or
    tents are always preferable to exterior types because of
 their
    superior ability to prevent contaminants from escaping into
 the HCW's
    breathing zone. Descriptions of both enclosing and exterior
 devices
    have been published previously (98).  
        Enclosing devices  The enclosing type of local exhaust ventilation device
 includes
        laboratory hoods used for processing specimens that
 could contain
        viable infectious organisms, booths used for sputum
 induction or
        administration of aerosolized medications (e.g.,
 aerosolized
        pentamidine) (Figure_S31), and tents or hoods made
 of vinyl
        or other materials used to enclose and isolate a
 patient. These
        devices are available in various configurations. The
 most simple
        of these latter devices is a tent that is placed over
 the
        patient; the tent has an exhaust connection to the room
 discharge
        exhaust system. The most complex device is an enclosure
 that has
        a sophisticated self-contained airflow and
 recirculation system.  Both tents and booths should have sufficient airflow to
 remove at
        least 99% of airborne particles during the interval
 between the
        departure of one patient and the arrival of the next
 (99). The
        time required for removing a given percentage of
 airborne
        particles from an enclosed space depends on several
 factors.
        These factors include the number of ACH, which is
 determined by
        the number of cubic feet of air in the room or booth
 and the rate
        at which air is entering the room or booth at the
 intake source;
        the location of the ventilation inlet and outlet; and
 the
        physical configuration of the room or booth
 (Table_S31).  
        Exterior devices  The exterior type of local exhaust ventilation device
 is usually
        a hood very near, but not enclosing, the infectious
 patient. The
        airflow produced by these devices should be sufficient
 to prevent
        cross-currents of air near the patient's face from
 causing escape
        of droplet nuclei. Whenever possible, the patient
 should face
        directly into the hood opening so that any coughing or
 sneezing
        is directed into the hood, where the droplet nuclei are
 captured.
        The device should maintain an air velocity of greater
 than or
        equal to 200 feet per minute at the patient's breathing
 zone to
        ensure capture of droplet nuclei.  
        Discharge exhaust from booths, tents, and hoods  Air from booths, tents, and
hoods may be discharged
 into the room
        in which the device is located or it may be exhausted
 to the
        outside. If the air is discharged into the room, a HEPA
 filter
        should be incorporated at the discharge duct or vent of
 the
        device. The exhaust fan should be located on the
 discharge side
        of the HEPA filter to ensure that the air pressure in
 the filter
        housing and booth is negative with respect to adjacent
 areas.
        Uncontaminated air from the room will flow into the
 booth through
        all openings, thus preventing infectious droplet nuclei
 in the
        booth from escaping into the room. Most commercially
 available
        booths, tents, and hoods are fitted with HEPA filters,
 in which
        case additional HEPA filtration is not needed.  If the device does not incorporate a
HEPA filter, the
 air from
        the device should be exhausted to the outside in
 accordance with
        recommendations for isolation room exhaust (Suppl. 3,
 Section
        II.B.5). (See Supplement 3, Section II.C, for
 information
        regarding recirculation of exhaust air.)  
    General Ventilation  General ventilation can be used for several purposes,
 including
    diluting and removing contaminated air, controlling airflow
 patterns
    within rooms, and controlling the direction of airflow
 throughout a
    facility. Information on these topics is contained in the
 following
    sections.  
        Dilution and removal  Purpose: To reduce the concentration of contaminants in
 the air.  General ventilation maintains air quality by two
 processes:
        dilution and removal of airborne contaminants.
 Uncontaminated
        supply (i.e., incoming) air mixes with the contaminated
 room air
        (i.e., dilution), which is subsequently removed from
 the room by
        the exhaust system (i.e., removal). These processes
 reduce the
        concentration of droplet nuclei in the room air.  
            Types of general ventilation systems  Two types of general ventilation systems
can be
 used for
            dilution and removal of contaminated air: the
 single-pass
            system and the recirculating system. In a
 single-pass system,
            the supply air is either outside air that has been
 appro-
            priately heated and cooled or air from a central
 system that
            supplies a number of areas. After air passes
 through the room
            (or area), 100% of that air is exhausted to the
 outside. The
            single-pass system is the preferred choice in areas
 where
            infectious airborne droplet nuclei are known to be
 present
            (e.g., TB isolation rooms or treatment rooms)
 because it
            prevents contaminated air from being recirculated
 to other
            areas of the facility.  In a recirculating system, a small portion of the
 exhaust air
            is discharged to the outside and is replaced with
 fresh
            outside air, which mixes with the portion of
 exhaust air that
            was not discharged to the outside. The resulting
 mixture,
            which can contain a large proportion of
 contaminated air, is
            then recirculated to the areas serviced by the
 system. This
            air mixture could be recirculated into the general
 ventila-
            tion, in which case contaminants may be carried
 from contam-
            inated areas to uncontaminated areas.
 Alternatively, the air
            mixture could also be recirculated within a
 specific room or
            area, in which case other areas of the facility
 will not be
            affected (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3).  
            Ventilation rates  Recommended general ventilation rates for
 health-care
            facilities are usually expressed in number of ACH.
 This
            number is the ratio of the volume of air entering
 the room
            per hour to the room volume and is equal to the
 exhaust
            airflow (Q {cubic feet per minute}) divided by the
 room
            volume (V {cubic feet}) multiplied by 60 (i.e., ACH
 = Q / V
            x 60).  The feasibility of achieving specific ventilation
 rates
            depends on the construction and operational
 requirements of
            the ventilation system (e.g., the energy
 requirements to move
            and to heat or cool the air). The feasibility of
 achieving
            specific ventilation rates may also be different
 for retro-
            fitted facilities and newly constructed facilities.
 The
            expense and effort of achieving specific higher
 ventilation
            rates for new construction may be reasonable,
 whereas retro-
            fitting an existing facility to achieve similar
 ventilation
            rates may be more difficult. However, achieving
 higher
            ventilation rates by using auxiliary methods (e.g.,
 room-air
            recirculation) in addition to exhaust ventilation
 may be
            feasible in existing facilities (Suppl. 3, Section
 II.C).  
        Airflow patterns within rooms (air mixing)  Purpose: To provide optimum airflow
patterns and
 prevent both
        stagnation  and  short-circuiting  of  air.   General  ventilation  systems  should  be
designed to
 provide optimal
        patterns of airflow within rooms and prevent air
 stagnation or
        short-circuiting of air from the supply to the exhaust
 (i.e.,
        passage of air directly from the air supply to the air
 exhaust).
        To provide optimal airflow patterns, the air supply and
 exhaust
        should be located such that clean air first flows to
 parts of the
        room where HCWs are likely to work, and then flows
 across the
        infectious source and into the exhaust. In this way,
 the HCW is
        not positioned between the infectious source and the
 exhaust
        location. Although this configuration may not always be
 possible,
        it should be used whenever feasible. One way to achieve
 this
        airflow pattern is to supply air at the side of the
 room opposite
        the patient and exhaust it from the side where the
 patient is
        located. Another method, which is most effective when
 the supply
        air is cooler than the room air, is to supply air near
 the
        ceiling and exhaust it near the floor (Figure_S32).
 Airflow
        patterns are affected by large air temperature
 differentials, the
        precise location of the supply and exhausts, the
 location of
        furniture, the movement of HCWs and patients, and the
 physical
        configuration of the space. Smoke tubes can be used to
 visualize
        airflow patterns in a manner similar to that described
 for
        estimating room air mixing.  Adequate air mixing, which requires that an adequate
 number of
        ACH be provided to a room (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.1),
 must be
        ensured to prevent air stagnation within the room.
 However, the
        air will not usually be changed the calculated number
 of times
        per hour because the airflow patterns in the room may
 not permit
        complete mixing of the supply and room air in all parts
 of the
        room. This results in an "effective" airflow rate in
 which the
        supplied airflow may be less than required for proper
 ventila-
        tion. To account for this variation, a mixing factor
 (which
        ranges from 1 for perfect mixing to 10 for poor mixing)
 is
        applied as a multiplier to determine the actual supply
 airflow
        (i.e., the recommended ACH multiplied by the mixing
 factor equals
        the actual required ACH) (51,98). The room air supply
 and exhaust
        system should be designed to achieve the lowest mixing
 factor
        possible. The mixing factor is determined most
 accurately by
        experimentally testing each space configuration, but
 this
        procedure is complex and time-consuming. A reasonably
 good
        qualitative measure of mixing can be estimated by an
 experienced
        ventilation engineer who releases smoke from smoke
 tubes at a
        number of locations in the room and observes the
 movement of the
        smoke. Smoke movement in all areas of the room
 indicates good
        mixing. Stagnation of air in some areas of the room
 indicates
        poor mixing, and movement of the supply and exhaust
 openings or
        redirection of the supply air is necessary.  
        Airflow direction in the facility  Purpose: To contain contaminated air in localized
areas
 in a
        facility and prevent its spread to uncontaminated
 areas.  
            Directional airflow  The general ventilation system should be designed
 and
            balanced so that air flows from less contaminated
 (i.e., more
            clean) to more contaminated (less clean) areas
 (47,48). For
            example, air should flow from corridors (cleaner
 areas) into
            TB isolation rooms (less clean areas) to prevent
 spread of
            contaminants to other areas. In some special
 treatment rooms
            in which operative and invasive procedures are
 performed, the
            direction of airflow is from the room to the
 hallway to
            provide cleaner air during these procedures.
 Cough-inducing
            or aerosol-generating procedures (e.g.,
 bronchoscopy and
            irrigation of tuberculous abscesses) should not be
 performed
            in rooms with this type of airflow on patients who
 may have
            infectious TB.  
            Negative pressure for achieving directional airflow
  The direction of airflow is controlled by creating
 a lower
            (negative) pressure in the area into which the flow
 of air is
            desired. For air to flow from one area to another,
 the air
            pressure in the two areas must be different. Air
 will flow
            from a higher pressure area to a lower pressure
 area. The
            lower pressure area is described as being at
 negative
            ******** pressure relative to the higher pressure
 area.
            Negative pressure is attained by exhausting air
 from an area
            at a higher rate than air is being supplied. The
 level of
            negative pressure necessary to achieve the desired
 airflow
            will depend on the physical configuration of the
 ventilation
            system and area, including the airflow path and
 flow
            openings, and should be determined on an individual
 basis by
            an experienced ventilation engineer.  
        Achieving negative pressure in a room  Purpose: To control the direction of airflow
between
 the room and
        adjacent areas, thereby preventing contaminated air
 from escaping
        from the room into other areas of the facility.  
            Pressure differential  The minimum pressure difference necessary to
 achieve and
            maintain negative pressure that will result in
 airflow into
            the room is very small (0.001 inch of water).
 Higher
            pressures ( greater than or equal to 0.001 inch of
 water) are
            satisfactory; however, these higher pressures may
 be
            difficult to achieve. The actual level of negative
 pressure
            achieved will depend on the difference in the
 ventilation
            exhaust and supply flows and the physical
 configuration of
            the room, including the airflow path and flow
 openings. If
            the room is well sealed, negative pressures greater
 than the
            minimum of 0.001 inch of water may be readily
 achieved.
            However, if rooms are not well sealed, as may be
 the case in
            many facilities (especially older facilities),
 achieving
            higher negative pressures may require
 exhaust/supply flow
            differentials beyond the capability of the
 ventilation
            system.  To establish negative pressure in a room that has a
 normally
            functioning ventilation system, the room supply and
 exhaust
            airflows are first balanced to achieve an exhaust
 flow of
            either 10% or 50 cubic feet per minute (cfm)
 greater than the
            supply (whichever is the greater). In most
 situations, this
            specification should achieve a negative pressure of
 at least
            0.001 inch of water. If the minimum 0.001 inch of
 water is
            not achieved and cannot be achieved by increasing
 the flow
            differential (within the limits of the ventilation
 system),
            the room should be inspected for leakage (e.g.,
 through
            doors, windows, plumbing, and equipment wall
 penetrations),
            and corrective action should be taken to seal the
 leaks.  Negative pressure in a room can be altered by
 changing the
            ventilation system operation or by the opening and
 closing of
            the room's doors, corridor doors, or windows. When
 an
            operating configuration has been established, it is
 essential
            that all doors and windows remain properly closed
 in the
            isolation room and other areas (e.g., doors in
 corridors that
            affect air pressure) except when persons need to
 enter or
            leave the room or area.  
            Alternate methods for achieving negative pressure  Although an anteroom is not
a substitute for
 negative
            pressure in a room, it may be used to reduce escape
 of
            droplet nuclei during opening and closing of the
 isolation
            room door. Some anterooms have their own air supply
 duct, but
            others do not. The TB isolation room should have
 negative
            pressure relative to the anteroom, but the air
 pressure in
            the anteroom relative to the corridor may vary
 depending on
            the building design. This should be determined, in
 accordance
            with applicable regulations, by a qualified
 ventilation
            engineer.  If the existing ventilation system is incapable of
 achieving
            the desired negative pressure because the room
 lacks a
            separate ventilation system or the room's system
 cannot
            provide the proper airflow, steps should be taken
 to provide
            a means to discharge air from the room. The amount
 of air to
            be exhausted will be the same as discussed
 previously (Suppl.
            3, Section II.B.4.a).  Fixed room-air recirculation systems (i.e., systems
 that
            recirculate the air in an entire room) may be
 designed to
            achieve negative pressure by discharging air
 outside the room
            (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3).  Some portable room-air recirculation units (Suppl.
 3, Section
            II.C.3.b.) are designed to discharge air to the
 outside to
            achieve negative pressure. Air cleaners that can
 accomplish
            this must be designed specifically for this
 purpose.  A small centrifugal blower (i.e., exhaust fan) can
 be used to
            exhaust air to the outside through a window or
 outside wall.
            This approach may be used as an interim measure to
 achieve
            negative pressure, but it provides no fresh air and
            suboptimal dilution.  Another approach to achieving the required pressure
            difference is to pressurize the corridor. Using
 this method,
            the corridor's general ventilation system is
 balanced to
            create a higher air pressure in the corridor than
 in the
            isolation room; the type of balancing necessary
 depends on
            the configuration of the ventilation system.
 Ideally, the
            corridor air supply rate should be increased while
 the
            corridor exhaust rate is not increased. If this is
 not
            possible, the exhaust rate should be decreased by
 resetting
            appropriate exhaust dampers. Caution should be
 exercised,
            however, to ensure that the exhaust rate is not
 reduced below
            acceptable levels. This approach requires that all
 settings
            used to achieve the pressure balance, including
 doors, be
            maintained. This method may not be desirable if the
 corridor
            being pressurized has rooms in which negative
 pressure is not
            desired. In many situations, this system is
 difficult to
            achieve, and it should be considered only after
 careful
            review by ventilation personnel.  
            Monitoring  negative  pressure   The  negative  pressure  in  a  room  can  be
monitored by
 visually
            observing the direction of airflow (e.g., using
 smoke tubes)
            or by measuring the differential pressure between
 the room
            and its surrounding area.  Smoke from a smoke tube can be used to observe
 airflow
            between areas or airflow patterns within an area.
 To check
            the negative pressure in a room by using a smoke
 tube, hold
            the smoke tube near the bottom of the door and
 approximately
            2 inches in front of the door, or at the face of a
 grille or
            other opening if the door has such a feature, and
 generate a
            small amount of smoke by gently squeezing the bulb
            (Figure_S33). The smoke tube should be held
 parallel to
            the door, and the smoke should be issued from the
 tube slowly
            to ensure the velocity of the smoke from the tube
 does not
            overpower the air velocity. The smoke will travel
 in the
            direction of airflow. If the room is at negative
 pressure,
            the smoke will travel under the door and into the
 room (e.g.,
            from higher to lower pressure). If the room is not
 at
            negative pressure, the smoke will be blown outward
 or will
            stay stationary. This test must be performed while
 the door
            is closed. If room air cleaners are being used in
 the room,
            they should be running. The smoke is irritating if
 inhaled,
            and care should be taken not to inhale it directly
 from the
            smoke tube. However, the quantity of smoke issued
 from the
            tube is minimal and is not detectable at short
 distances from
            the tube.  Differential pressure-sensing devices also can be
 used to
            monitor negative pressure; they can provide either
 periodic
            (noncontinuous) pressure measurements or continuous
 pressure
            monitoring. The continuous monitoring component may
 simply be
            a visible and/or audible warning signal that air
 pressure is
            low. In addition, it may also provide a pressure
 readout
            signal, which can be recorded for later
 verification or used
            to automatically adjust the facility's ventilation
 control
            system.  Pressure-measuring devices should sense the room
 pressure
            just inside the airflow path into the room (e.g.,
 at the
            bottom of the door). Unusual airflow patterns
 within the room
            can cause pressure variations; for example, the air
 can be at
            negative pressure at the middle of a door and at
 positive
            pressure at the bottom of the same door
 (Figure_S34). If
            the pressure-sensing ports of the device cannot be
 located
            directly across the airflow path, it will be
 necessary to
            validate that the negative pressure at the sensing
 point is
            and remains the same as the negative pressure
 across the flow
            path.  Pressure-sensing devices should incorporate an
 audible
            warning with a time delay to indicate that a door
 is open.
            When the door to the room is opened, the negative
 pressure
            will decrease. The time-delayed signal should allow
            sufficient time for persons to enter or leave the
 room
            without  activating  the  audible  warning.   A  potential  problem  with  using
pressure-sensing
 devices is
            that the pressure differentials used to achieve the
 low
            negative pressure necessitate the use of very
 sensitive
            mechanical devices, electronic devices, or pressure
 gauges to
            ensure accurate measurements. Use of devices that
 cannot
            measure these low pressures (i.e., pressures as low
 as 0.001
            inch of water) will require setting higher negative
 pressures
            that may be difficult and, in some instances,
 impractical to
            achieve (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.4).  Periodic checks are required to ensure that
the
 desired
            negative pressure is present and that the
 continuous
            monitoring devices, if used, are operating
 properly. If smoke
            tubes or other visual checks are used, TB isolation
 rooms and
            treatment rooms should be checked frequently for
 negative
            pressure. Rooms undergoing changes to the
 ventilation system
            should be checked daily. TB isolation rooms should
 be checked
            daily for negative pressure while being used for TB
            isolation. If these rooms are not being used for
 patients who
            have suspected or confirmed TB but potentially
 could be used
            for such patients, the negative pressure in the
 rooms should
            be checked monthly. If pressure-sensing devices are
 used,
            negative pressure should be verified at least once
 a month by
            using smoke tubes or taking pressure measurements.  
    HEPA filtration  Purpose: To remove contaminants from the air.  HEPA filtration can
be used as a method of air cleaning
 that supple-
    ments other recommended ventilation measures. For the
 purposes of
    these guidelines, HEPA filters are defined as air-cleaning
 devices
    that have a demonstrated and documented minimum removal
 efficiency of
    99.97% of particles greater than or equal to 0.3 um in
 diameter. HEPA
    filters have been shown to be effective in reducing the
 concentration
    of Aspergillus spores (which range in size from 1.5 um to 6
 um) to
    below measurable levels (100-102). The ability of HEPA
 filters to
    remove tubercle bacilli from the air has not been studied,
 but M.
    tuberculosis droplet nuclei probably range from 1 um to 5
 um in
    diameter (i.e., approximately the same size as Aspergillus
 spores).
    Therefore, HEPA filters can be expected to remove
 infectious droplet
    nuclei from contaminated air. HEPA filters can be used to
 clean air
    before it is exhausted to the outside, recirculated to
 other areas of
    a facility, or recirculated within a room. If the device is
 not
    completely passive (e.g., it utilizes techniques such as
 electro-
    statics) and the failure of the electrostatic components
 permits loss
    of filtration efficiency to less than 99.97%, the device
 should not
    be used in systems that recirculate air back into the
 general
    facility ventilation system from TB isolation rooms and
 treatment
    rooms in which procedures are performed on patients who may
 have
    infectious TB (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.2).  HEPA filters can be used in a number of ways
to reduce or
 eliminate
    infectious droplet nuclei from room air or exhaust. These
 methods
    include placement of HEPA filters a) in exhaust ducts to
 remove
    droplet nuclei from air being discharged to the outside,
 either
    directly or through ventilation equipment; b) in ducts
 discharging
    room air into the general ventilation system; and c) in
 fixed or
    portable room-air cleaners. The effectiveness of portable
 HEPA room-
    air cleaning units has not been evaluated adequately, and
 there is
    probably considerable variation in their effectiveness.
 HEPA filters
    can also be used in exhaust ducts or vents that discharge
 air from
    booths or enclosures into the surrounding room (Suppl. 3,
 Section
    II.A.3). In any application, HEPA filters should be
 installed
    carefully and maintained meticulously to ensure adequate
 function.  Manufacturers of room-air cleaning equipment should provide
 documen-
    tation of the HEPA filter efficiency and the efficiency of
 the
    installed device in lowering room-air contaminant levels.  
        Use of HEPA filtration when exhausting air to the
 outside  HEPA filters can be used as an added safety measure to
 clean air
        from isolation rooms and local exhaust devices (i.e.,
 booths,
        tents, or hoods used for cough-inducing procedures)
 before
        exhausting it directly to the outside, but such use is
 unneces-
        sary if the exhaust air cannot re-enter the ventilation
 system
        supply. The use of HEPA filters should be considered
 wherever
        exhaust air could possibly reenter the system.  In many instances, exhaust air is
not discharged
 directly to the
        outside; rather, the air is directed through
 heat-recovery
        devices (e.g., heat wheels). Heat wheels are often used
 to reduce
        the costs of operating ventilation systems (103). If
 such units
        are used with the system, a HEPA filter should also be
 used. As
        the wheel rotates, energy is transferred into or
 removed from the
        supply inlet air stream. The HEPA filter should be
 placed
        upstream from the heat wheel because of the potential
 for leakage
        across the seals separating the inlet and exhaust
 chambers and
        the theoretical possibility that droplet nuclei could
 be impacted
        on the wheel by the exhaust air and subsequently
 stripped off
        into the supply air.  
        Recirculation of HEPA-filtered air to other areas of a
 facility  Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms used to
 treat
        patients who have confirmed or suspected infectious TB
 should be
        exhausted to the outside in accordance with applicable
 federal,
        state, and local regulations. The air should not be
 recirculated
        into the general ventilation. In some instances,
 recirculation of
        air into the general ventilation system from such rooms
 is
        unavoidable (i.e., in existing facilities in which the
 ventila-
        tion system or facility configuration makes venting the
 exhaust
        to the outside impossible). In such cases, HEPA filters
 should be
        installed in the exhaust duct leading from the room to
 the
        general ventilation system to remove infectious
 organisms and
        particulates the size of droplet nuclei from the air
 before it is
        returned to the general ventilation system (Section
 II.F; Suppl.
        3). Air from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms in
 new or
        renovated facilities should not be recirculated into
 the general
        ventilation system.  
        Recirculation of HEPA-filtered air within a room  Individual room-air recirculation
can be used in areas
 where
        there is no general ventilation system, where an
 existing system
        is incapable of providing adequate airflow, or where an
 increase
        in ventilation is desired without affecting the fresh
 air supply
        or negative pressure system already in place.
 Recirculation of
        HEPA-filtered air within a room can be achieved in
 several ways:  
            by exhausting air from the room into a duct,
 filtering it
            through a HEPA filter installed in the duct, and
 returning it to
            the room (Figure_S35); b) by filtering air through
 HEPA
            recirculation systems mounted on the wall or ceiling of
 the room
            (Figure_S36); or c) by filtering air through
 portable HEPA
            recirculation systems. In this document, the first two
 of these
            approaches are referred to as fixed room-air
 recirculation
            systems, because the HEPA filter devices are fixed in
 place and
            are not easily movable.  
            Fixed room-air recirculation systems  The preferred method of recirculating
HEPA-filtered
 air
            within a room is a built-in system, in which air is
 exhausted
            from the room into a duct, filtered through a HEPA
 filter,
            and returned to the room (Figure_S35). This
 technique may
            be used to add air changes in areas where there is
 a
            recommended minimum ACH that is difficult to meet
 with
            general ventilation alone. The air does not have to
 be
            conditioned, other than by the filtration, and this
 permits
            higher airflow rates than the general ventilation
 system can
            usually achieve. An alternative is the use of HEPA
 filtration
            units that are mounted on the wall or ceiling of
 the room
            (Figure_S37). Fixed recirculation systems are
 preferred
            over portable (free-standing) units because they
 can be
            installed and maintained with a greater degree of
            reliability.  
            Portable  room-air  recirculation  units   Portable  HEPA  filtration  units  may  be
considered
 for recir-
            culating air within rooms in which there is no
 general
            ventilation system, where the system is incapable
 of
            providing adequate airflow, or where increased
 effectiveness
            in room airflow is desired. Effectiveness depends
 on circu-
            lating as much of the air in the room as possible
 through the
            HEPA filter, which may be difficult to achieve and
 evaluate.
            The effectiveness of a particular unit can vary
 depending on
            the room's configuration, the furniture and persons
 in the
            room, and placement of the HEPA filtration unit and
 the
            supply and exhaust grilles. Therefore, the
 effectiveness of
            the portable unit may vary considerably in rooms
 with
            different configurations or in the same room if
 moved from
            one location to another in the room. If portable
 units are
            used, caution should be exercised to ensure they
 can recir-
            culate all or nearly all of the room air through
 the HEPA
            filter. Some commercially available units may not
 be able to
            meet this requirement because of design limitations
 or insuf-
            ficient airflow capacity. In addition, units should
 be
            designed and operated to ensure that persons in the
 room
            cannot interfere with or otherwise compromise the
 functioning
            of the unit. Portable HEPA filtration units have
 not been
            evaluated adequately to determine their role in TB
 infection-
            control programs.  Portable HEPA filtration units should be designed
 to achieve
            the equivalent of greater than or equal to 12 ACH.
 They
            should also be designed to ensure adequate air
 mixing in all
            areas of the hospital rooms in which they are used,
 and they
            should not interfere with the current ventilation
 system.  Some HEPA filtration units employ UVGI for
 disinfecting air
            after HEPA filtration. However, whether exposing
 the HEPA-
            filtered air to UV irradiation further decreases
 the concen-
            tration of contaminants is not known.  
            Evaluation of room-air recirculation systems and
 units  Detailed and accurate evaluations of room-air
 recirculation
            systems and units require the use of sophisticated
 test
            equipment and lengthy test procedures that are not
 practical.
            However, an estimate of the unit's ability to
 circulate the
            air in the room can be made by visualizing airflow
 patterns
            as was described previously for estimating room air
 mixing
            (Suppl. 3, Section II.B.1). If the air movement is
 good in
            all areas of the room, the unit should be
 effective.  
        Installing, maintaining, and monitoring HEPA filters  Proper installation and testing
and meticulous
 maintenance are
        critical if a HEPA filtration system is used (104),
 especially if
        the system used recirculates air to other parts of the
 facility.
        Improper design, installation, or maintenance could
 allow infec-
        tious particles to circumvent filtration and escape
 into the
        general ventilation system (47). HEPA filters should be
 installed
        to prevent leakage between filter segments and between
 the filter
        bed and its frame. A regularly scheduled maintenance
 program is
        required to monitor the HEPA filter for possible
 leakage and for
        filter loading. A quantitative leakage and filter
 performance
        test (e.g., the dioctal phthalate {DOP} penetration
 test {105})
        should be performed at the initial installation and
 every time
        the filter is changed or moved. The test should be
 repeated every
        6 months for filters in general-use areas and in areas
 with
        systems that exhaust air that is likely to be
 contaminated with
        M. tuberculosis (e.g, TB isolation rooms).  A manometer or other pressure-sensing
device should be
 installed
        in the filter system to provide an accurate and
 objective means
        of determining the need for filter replacement.
 Pressure drop
        characteristics of the filter are supplied by the
 manufacturer of
        the filter. Installation of the filter should allow for
 mainten-
        ance that will not contaminate the delivery system or
 the area
        served. For general infection-control purposes, special
 care
        should be taken to not jar or drop the filter element
 during or
        after removal.  The scheduled maintenance program should include
 procedures for
        installation, removal, and disposal of filter elements.
 HEPA
        filter maintenance should be performed only by
 adequately trained
        personnel. Appropriate respiratory protection should be
 worn
        while performing maintenance and testing procedures. In
 addition,
        filter housing and ducts leading to the housing should
 be
        labelled clearly with the words "Contaminated Air" (or
 a similar
        warning).  When a HEPA filter is used, one or more lower
 efficiency dispos-
        able prefilters installed upstream will extend the
 useful life of
        the HEPA filter. A disposable filter can increase the
 life of a
        HEPA filter by 25%. If the disposable filter is
 followed by a 90%
        extended surface filter, the life of the HEPA filter
 can be
        extended almost 900% (98). These prefilters should be
 handled and
        disposed of in the same manner as the HEPA filter.  
    TB Isolation Rooms and Treatment Rooms  Purpose: To separate patients who are
likely to have
 infectious TB
    from other persons, to provide an environment that will
 allow
    reduction of the concentration of droplet nuclei through
 various
    engineering methods, and to prevent the escape of droplet
 nuclei from
    such rooms into the corridor and other areas of the
 facility using
    directional airflow.  A hierarchy of ventilation methods used to achieve a
 reduction in the
    concentration of droplet nuclei and to achieve directional
 airflow
    using negative pressure has been developed (Table_S32).
 The
    methods are listed in order from the most desirable to the
 least
    desirable. The method selected will depend on the
 configuration of
    the isolation room and the ventilation system in the
 facility; the
    determination should be made in consultation with a
 ventilation
    engineer.  
        Preventing  the  escape  of  droplet  nuclei  from  the  room   Rooms  used  for  TB
isolation should be single-patient
 rooms with
        negative pressure relative to the corridor or other
 areas
        connected to the room. Doors between the isolation room
 and other
        areas should remain closed except for entry into or
 exit from the
        room. The room's openings (e.g., windows and electrical
 and
        plumbing entries) should be sealed as much as possible.
 However,
        a small gap of 1/8 to 1/2 inch should be at the bottom
 of the
        door to provide a controlled airflow path. Proper use
 of negative
        pressure will prevent contaminated air from escaping
 the room.  
        Reducing the concentration of droplet nuclei in the
 room  ASHRAE (47), AIA (48), and the Health Resources and
 Services
        Administration (49) recommend a minimum of 6 ACH for TB
 isolation
        rooms and treatment rooms. This ventilation rate is
 based on
        comfort- and odor-control considerations. The
 effectiveness of
        this level of airflow in reducing the concentration of
 droplet
        nuclei in the room, thus reducing the transmission of
 airborne
        pathogens, has not been evaluated directly or
 adequately.  Ventilation rates greater than 6 ACH are likely to
 produce an
        incrementally greater reduction in the concentration of
 bacteria
        in a room than are lower rates (50-52). However,
 accurate quanti-
        tation of decreases in risk that would result from
 specific
        increases in general ventilation levels has not been
 performed
        and may not be possible.  To reduce the concentration of droplet nuclei, TB
 isolation rooms
        and treatment rooms in existing health-care facilities
 should
        have an airflow of greater than or equal to 6 ACH.
 Where
        feasible, this airflow rate should be increased to
 greater than
        or equal to 12 ACH by adjusting or modifying the
 ventilation
        system or by using auxiliary means (e.g., recirculation
 of air
        through fixed HEPA filtration units or portable air
 cleaners)
        (Suppl. 3, Section II.C) (53). New construction or
 renovation of
        existing health-care facilities should be designed so
 that TB
        isolation rooms achieve an airflow of greater than or
 equal to 12
        ACH.  
        Exhaust from TB isolation rooms and treatment rooms  Air from TB isolation rooms
and treatment rooms in
 which patients
        with infectious TB may be examined should be exhausted
 directly
        to the outside of the building and away from air-intake
 vents,
        persons, and animals in accordance with federal, state,
 and local
        regulations concerning environmental discharges. (See
 Suppl. 3,
        Section II.C, for information regarding recirculation
 of exhaust
        air.) Exhaust ducts should not be located near areas
 that may be
        populated (e.g., near sidewalks or windows that could
 be opened).
        Ventilation system exhaust discharges and inlets should
 be
        designed to prevent reentry of exhausted air. Wind
 blowing over
        a building creates a highly turbulent recirculation
 zone, which
        can cause exhausted air to reenter the building
 (Figure_S37).
        Exhaust flow should be discharged above this zone
 (Suppl. 3,
        Section II.C.1). Design guidelines for proper placement
 of
        exhaust ducts can be found in the 1989 ASHRAE
 Fundamentals
        Handbook (106). If recirculation of air from such rooms
 into the
        general ventilation system is unavoidable, the air
 should be
        passed through a HEPA filter before recirculation
 (Suppl. 3,
        Section II.C.2).  
        Alternatives to TB isolation rooms  Isolation can also be achieved by use of
 negative-pressure
        enclosures (e.g, tents or booths) (Suppl. 3, Section
 II.A.1).
        These can be used to provide patient isolation in areas
 such as
        emergency rooms and medical testing and treatment areas
 and to
        supplement  isolation  in  designated  isolation  rooms.   UVGI   Purpose:  To  kill  or
inactivate airborne tubercle bacilli.  Research has demonstrated that UVGI is effective in
killing or
 inacti-
vating tubercle bacilli under experimental conditions
 (66,107-110) and in
reducing transmission of other infections in hospitals (111),
 military
housing (112), and classrooms (113-115). Because of the results
 of
numerous studies (116-120) and the experiences of TB clinicians
 and
mycobacteriologists during the past several decades, the use of
 UVGI has
been recommended as a supplement to other TB infection-control
 measures
in settings where the need for killing or inactivating tubercle
 bacilli
is  important  (2,4,121-125).   UV  radiation  is  defined  as  that  portion  of  the
electromagnetic
 spectrum
described by wavelengths from 100 to 400 nm. For convenience of
 classi-
fication, the UV spectrum has been separated into three
 different wave-
length bands: UV-A (long wavelengths, range: 320-400 nm), UV-B
 (midrange
wavelengths, range: 290-320 nm), and UV-C (short wavelengths,
 range:
100-290 nm) (126). Commercially available UV lamps used for
 germicidal
purposes are low-pressure mercury vapor lamps (127) that emit
 radiant
energy in the UV-C range, predominantly at a wavelength of
 253.7 nm
(128).  
    Applications  UVGI can be used as a method of air disinfection to
 supplement other
    engineering controls. Two systems of UVGI can be used for
 this
    purpose: duct irradiation and upper-room air irradiation.  
        Duct irradiation  Purpose: To inactivate tubercle bacilli without
 exposing persons
        to UVGI.  In duct irradiation systems, UV lamps are placed inside
 ducts
        that remove air from rooms to disinfect the air before
 it is
        recirculated. When UVGI duct systems are properly
 designed,
        installed, and maintained, high levels of UV radiation
 may be
        produced in the duct work. The only potential for human
 exposure
        to this radiation occurs during maintenance operations.
  Duct irradiation may be used:  
            In a TB isolation room or treatment room to
 recirculate air
            from the room, through a duct containing UV lamps,
 and back
            into the room. This recirculation method can
 increase the
            overall room airflow but does not increase the
 supply of
            fresh outside air to the room.  
            In other patients' rooms and in waiting rooms,
 emergency
            rooms, and other general-use areas of a facility
 where
            patients with undiagnosed TB could potentially
 contaminate
            the air, to recirculate air back into the general
 ventila-
            tion.  Duct-irradiation systems are dependent on airflow
 patterns
            within a room that ensure that all or nearly all of
 the room
            air circulates through the duct.  
        Upper-room air irradiation  Purpose: To inactivate tubercle bacilli in the upper
 part of the
        room, while minimizing radiation exposure to persons in
 the lower
        part of the room.  In upper-room air irradiation, UVGI lamps are suspended
 from the
        ceiling or mounted on the wall. The bottom of the lamp
 is
        shielded to direct the radiation upward but not
 downward. The
        system depends on air mixing to take irradiated air
 from the
        upper to the lower part of the room, and nonirradiated
 air from
        the lower to the upper part. The irradiated air space
 is much
        larger than that in a duct system.  UVGI has been effective in killing bacteria under
 conditions
        where air mixing was accomplished mainly by convection.
 For
        example, BCG was atomized in a room that did not have
 supple-
        mental ventilation (120), and in another study a
 surrogate
        bacteria, Serratia marcesens, was aerosolized in a room
 with a
        ventilation rate of 6 ACH (129). These reports
 estimated the
        effect of UVGI to be equivalent to 10 and 39 ACH,
 respectively,
        for the organisms tested, which are less resistant to
 UVGI than
        M. tuberculosis (120). The addition of fans or some
 heating/air
        conditioning arrangements may double the effectiveness
 of UVGI
        lamps (130-132). Greater rates of ventilation, however,
 may
        decrease the length of time the air is irradiated, thus
        decreasing the killing of bacteria (117,129). The
 optimal rela-
        tionship between ventilation and UVGI is not known. Air
 irradi-
        ation lamps used in corridors have been effective in
 killing
        atomized S. marcesens (133). Use of UVGI lamps in an
 outpatient
        room has reduced culturable airborne bacteria by
 14%-19%.
        However, the irradiation did not reduce the
 concentration of
        gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria; although
 fast-growing
        mycobacteria were cultured, M. tuberculosis could not
 be
        recovered from the room's air samples because of fungal
 over-
        growth of media plates (134).  Upper-room air UVGI irradiation may be used:  
            In isolation or treatment rooms as a supplemental
 method of
            air cleaning.  
            In other patients' rooms and in waiting rooms,
 emergency
            rooms, corridors, and other central areas of a
 facility where
            patients with undiagnosed TB could potentially
 contaminate
            the air.  Determinants of UVGI effectiveness include room
 configura-
            tion, UV lamp placement, and the adequacy of
 airflow patterns
            in bringing contaminated air into contact with the
 irradiated
            upper-room space. Air mixing may be facilitated by
 supplying
            cool air near the ceiling in rooms where warmer air
 (or a
            heating device) is present below. The ceiling
 should be high
            enough for a large volume of upper-room air to be
 irradiated
            without HCWs and patients being overexposed to UV
 radiation.  
    Limitations  Because the clinical effectiveness of UV systems varies,
 and because
    of the risk for transmission of M. tuberculosis if a system
 malfunc-
    tions or is maintained improperly, UVGI is not recommended
 for the
    following specific applications:  
        Duct systems using UVGI are not recommended as a
 substitute
        for HEPA filters if air from isolation rooms must be
 recirculated
        to other areas of a facility.  
        UVGI alone is not recommended as a substitute for
 HEPA
        filtration or local exhaust of air to the outside from
 booths,
        tents, or hoods used for cough-inducing procedures.  
        UVGI is not a substitute for negative pressure.  The use of UV lamps and HEPA
filtration in a single unit
 would not be
    expected to have any infection-control benefits not
 provided by use
    of the HEPA filter alone.  The effectiveness of UVGI in killing airborne tubercle
 bacilli
    depends on the intensity of UVGI, the duration of contact
 the
    organism has with the irradiation, and the relative
 humidity
    (66,108,111). Humidity can have an adverse effect on UVGI
 effective-
    ness at levels greater than 70% relative humidity for S.
 marcescens
    (135). The interaction of these factors has not been fully
 defined,
    however, making precise recommendations for individual UVGI
 instal-
    lations difficult to develop.  Old lamps or dust-covered UV lamps are less effective;
 therefore,
    regular maintenance of UVGI systems is crucial.  
    Safety Issues  Short-term overexposure to UV radiation can cause erythema
 and kera-
    toconjunctivitis (136,137). Broad-spectrum UV radiation has
 been
    associated with increased risk for squamous and basal cell
 carcinomas
    of the skin (138). UV-C was recently classified by the
 International
    Agency for Research on Cancer as "probably carcinogenic to
 humans
    (Group 2A)" (138). This classification is based on studies
 suggesting
    that UV-C radiation can induce skin cancers in animals; DNA
 damage,
    chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchange and
 transfor-
    mation in human cells in vitro; and DNA damage in mammalian
 skin
    cells in vivo. In the animal studies, a contribution of
 UV-B to the
    tumor effects could not be excluded, but the effects were
 greater
    than expected for UV-B alone (138). Although some recent
 studies have
    demonstrated that UV radiation can activate HIV gene
 promoters (i.e.,
    the genes in HIV that prompt replication of the virus) in
 laboratory
    samples of human cells (139-144), the implications of these
 in vitro
    findings for humans are unknown.  In 1972, the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and
 Health
    (NIOSH) published a recommended exposure limit (REL) for
 occupational
    exposure to UV radiation (136). The REL is intended to
 protect
    workers from the acute effects of UV exposure (e.g.,
 erythema and
    photokeratoconjunctivitis). However, photosensitive persons
 and those
    exposed concomitantly to photoactive chemicals may not be
 protected
    by  the  recommended  standard.   If  proper  procedures  are  not  followed,  HCWs
performing
 maintenance on
    such fixtures are at risk for exposure to UV radiation.
 Because UV
    fixtures used for upper-room air irradiation are present in
 rooms,
    rather than hidden in ducts, safety may be much more
 difficult to
    achieve and maintain. Fixtures must be designed and
 installed to
    ensure that UV exposure to persons in the room (including
 HCWs and
    inpatients) are below current safe exposure levels. Recent
 health
    hazard evaluations conducted by CDC have noted problems
 with over-
    exposure of HCWs to UVGI and with inadequate maintenance,
 training,
    labelling, and use of personal protective equipment
 (145-147).  The current number of persons who are properly trained in
 UVGI system
    design and installation is limited. CDC strongly recommends
 that a
    competent UVGI system designer be consulted to address
 safety consid-
    erations before such a system is procured and installed.
 Experts who
    might be consulted include industrial hygienists,
 engineers, and
    health physicists. Principles for the safe installation of
 UV lamp
    fixtures have been developed and can be used as guidelines
 (148,149).  If UV lamps are being used in a facility, the general TB
 education of
    HCWs should include:  
        The basic principles of UVGI systems (i.e., how they

        medical conditions or use of some medications.

 Light-
    weight clothing made of tightly woven fabric and
 UV-absorbing
    sunscreens with solar-protection factors (SPFs) greater
 than or equal
    to 15 may help protect photosensitive persons. HCWs should
 be advised
    that any eye or skin irritation that develops after UV
 exposure
    should be examined by occupational health staff.  
    Exposure Criteria for UV Radiation  The NIOSH REL for UV radiation is wavelength
dependent
 because
    different wavelengths of UV radiation have different
 adverse effects
    on the skin and eyes (136). Relative spectral effectiveness
 (S sub l)
    is used to compare various UV sources with a source
 producing UV
    radiation at 270 nm, the wavelength of maximum ocular
 sensitivity.
    For example, the S sub l at 254 nm is 0.5; therefore, twice
 as much
    energy is required at 254 nm to produce an identical
 biologic effect
    at 270 nm (136). Thus, at 254 nm, the NIOSH REL is 0.006
 joules per
    square centimeter (J/cm2); and at 270 nm, it is 0.003
 J/cm2.  For germicidal lamps that emit radiant energy predominantly
 at a
    wavelength of 254 nm, proper use of the REL requires that
 the
    measured irradiance level (E) in microwatts per square
 centimeter
    (uW/cm2) be multiplied by the relative spectral
 effectiveness at 254
    nm (0.5) to obtain the effective irradiance (Eeff). The
 maximum
    permissible exposure time can then be determined for
 selected values
    of Eeff (Table_S33), or it can be calculated (in
 seconds) by
    dividing 0.003 J/cm2 (the NIOSH REL at 270 nm) by Eeff in
 uW/cm2
    (136,150).  To protect HCWs who are exposed to germicidal UV radiation
 for 8
    hours per workday, the measured irradiance (E) should be
 less than or
    equal to 0.2 uW/cm2. This is calculated by obtaining Eeff
 (0.1
    YuW/cm2) (Table_S33) and then dividing this value by S
 sub l
    (0.5).  
    Maintenance and Monitoring  
        Labelling and posting  Warning signs should be posted on UV lamps and wherever
 high-
        intensity (i.e., UV exposure greater than the REL)
 germicidal UV
        irradiation is present (e.g., upper-room air space and
 accesses
        to ducts {if duct irradiation is used}) to alert
 maintenance
        staff or other HCWs of the hazard. Some examples are
 shown below:  CAUTION                        CAUTION  ULTRAVIOLET ENERGY:             
ULTRAVIOLET
 ENERGY:
        TURN OFF LAMPS BEFORE             PROTECT EYES &
 SKIN  ENTERING UPPER ROOM  
        Maintenance  Because the intensity of UV lamps fluctuates as they
 age, a
        schedule for replacing the lamps should be developed.
 The
        schedule can be determined from either a time/use log
 or a system
        based on cumulative time. The tube should be checked
 periodically
        for dust build-up, which lessens the output of UVGI. If
 the tube
        is dirty, it should be allowed to cool, then cleaned
 with a damp
        cloth. Tubes should be replaced if they stop glowing or
 if they
        flicker to an objectionable extent. Maintenance
 personnel must
        turn off all UV tubes before entering the upper part of
 the room
        or before accessing ducts for any purpose. Only a few
 seconds of
        direct exposure to the intense UV radiation in the
 upper-room air
        space or in ducts can cause burns. Protective equipment
 (e.g.,
        gloves and goggles {and/or face shields}) should be
 worn if
        exposure greater than the recommended standard is
 anticipated.  Banks of UVGI tubes can be installed in ventilating
 ducts. Safety
        devices should be used on access doors to eliminate
 hazard to
        maintenance personnel. For duct irradiation systems,
 the access
        door for servicing the lamps should have an inspection
 window
        ********* through which the lamps are checked
 periodically for
        dust build-up and malfunctioning. The access door
 should have a
        warning sign written in languages appropriate for
 maintenance
        personnel to alert them to the health hazard of looking
 directly
        at bare tubes. The lock for this door should have an
 automatic
        electric switch or other device that turns off the
 lamps when the
        door is opened.  Two types of fixtures are used in upper-room air
 irradiation:
        wall-mounted fixtures that have louvers to block
 downward
        radiation and ceiling-mounted fixtures that have
 baffles to block
        radiation below the horizontal plane of the UV tube.
 The actual
        UV tube in either type of fixture must not be visible
 from any
        normal position in the room. Light switches that can be
 locked
        should be used, if possible, to prevent injury to
 personnel who
        might unintentionally turn the lamps on during
 maintenance
        procedures.  In most applications, properly shielding the UV lamps
 to provide
        protection from most, if not all, of the direct UV
 radiation is
        not difficult. However, radiation reflected from glass,
 polished
        metal, and high-gloss ceramic paints can be harmful to
 persons in
        the room, particularly if more than one UV lamp is in
 use.
        Surfaces in irradiated rooms that can reflect UVGI into
 occupied
        areas of the room should be covered with non-UV
 reflecting
        material.  
        Monitoring  A regularly scheduled evaluation of the UV intensity to
 which
        HCWs, patients, and others are exposed should be
 conducted.  UV measurements should be made in various locations
 within a room
        using a detector designed to be most sensitive at 254
 nm.
        Equipment used to measure germicidal UV radiation
 should be
        maintained and calibrated on a regular schedule.  A new UV installation must be
carefully checked for hot
 spots
        (i.e., areas of the room where the REL is exceeded) by
 an indus-
        trial hygienist or other person knowledgeable in making
 UV
        measurements. UV radiation levels should not exceed
 those in the
        recommended guidelines.  Supplement 4: Respiratory Protection  
    Considerations for Selection of Respirators  Personal respiratory protection should be
used by a) persons
 entering
rooms where patients with known or suspected infectious TB are
 being
isolated, b) persons present during cough-inducing or
 aerosol-generating
procedures performed on such patients, and c) persons in other
 settings
where administrative and engineering controls are not likely to
 protect
them from inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei. These
 other
settings should be identified on the basis of the facility's
 risk
assessment.  Although data regarding the effectiveness of respiratory
 protection from
many hazardous airborne materials have been collected, the
 precise level
of effectiveness in protecting HCWs from M. tuberculosis
 transmission in
health-care settings has not been determined. Information
 concerning the
transmission of M. tuberculosis is incomplete. Neither the
 smallest
infectious dose of M. tuberculosis nor the highest level of
 exposure to
M. tuberculosis at which transmission will not occur has been
 defined
conclusively (59,151,152). Furthermore, the size distribution
 of droplet
nuclei and the number of particles containing viable M.
 tuberculosis that
are expelled by infectious TB patients have not been defined
 adequately,
and accurate methods of measuring the concentration of
 infectious droplet
nuclei  in  a  room  have  not  been  developed.   Nevertheless,  in  certain  settings  the
administrative and
 engineering
controls may not adequately protect HCWs from airborne droplet
 nuclei
(e.g., in TB isolation rooms, treatment rooms in which
 cough-inducing or
aerosol-generating procedures are performed, and ambulances
 during the
transport of infectious TB patients). Respiratory protective
 devices used
in these settings should have characteristics that are suitable
 for the
organism they are protecting against and the settings in which
 they are
used.  
    Performance Criteria for Personal Respirators for
 Protection Against
    Transmission of M. tuberculosis  Respiratory protective devices used in health-care
settings
 for
    protection against M. tuberculosis should meet the
 following standard
    criteria. These criteria are based on currently available
 informa-
    tion, including a) data on the effectiveness of respiratory
 protec-
    tion against noninfectious hazardous materials in
 workplaces other
    than health-care settings and on an interpretation of how
 these data
    can be applied to respiratory protection against M.
 tuberculosis; b)
    data on the efficiency of respirator filters in filtering
 biological
    aerosols; c) data on face-seal leakage; and d) data on the
 character-
    istics of respirators that were used in conjunction with
 adminis-
    trative and engineering controls in outbreak settings where
 trans-
    mission to HCWs and patients was terminated.  
        The ability to filter particles 1 um in size in the
 unloaded
        state with a filter efficiency of greater than or equal
 to 95%
        (i.e., filter leakage of less than or equal to 5%),
 given flow
        rates of up to 50 L per minute.  Available data suggest that infectious droplet
nuclei
 range in
        size from 1 um to 5 um; therefore, respirators used in
 health-
        care settings should be able to efficiently filter the
 smallest
        particles in this range. Fifty liters per minute is a
 reasonable
        estimate of the highest airflow rate an HCW is likely
 to achieve
        during breathing, even while performing strenuous work
 activi-
        ties.  
        The ability to be qualitatively or quantitatively fit
 tested in
        a reliable way to obtain a face-seal leakage of less
 than or
        equal to 10% (54,55).  
        The ability to fit the different facial sizes and
 characteristics
        of HCWs, which can usually be met by making the
 respirators
        available in at least three sizes.  
        The ability to be checked for facepiece fit, in
 accordance with
        OSHA standards and good industrial hygiene practice, by
 HCWs each
        time they put on their respirators (54,55).  In some settings, HCWs may be at risk
for two types of
 exposure: a)
        inhalation of M. tuberculosis and b) mucous membrane
 exposure to
        fluids that may contain bloodborne pathogens. In these
 settings,
        protection  against  both  types  of  exposure  should  be  used.   When  operative
procedures (or other procedures requiring a
 sterile
        field) are performed on patients who may have infectious
 TB, respira-
        tory protection worn by the HCW should serve two functions:
 a) it
        should protect the surgical field from the respiratory
 secretions of
        the HCW and b) it should protect the HCW from infectious
 droplet
        nuclei that may be expelled by the patient or generated by
 the
        procedure. Respirators with expiration valves and
 positive-pressure
        respirators do not protect the sterile field; therefore, a
 respirator
        that does not have a valve and that meets the criteria in
 Supplement
        4, Section I.A, should be used.  
    Specific Respirators  The OSHA respiratory protection standard requires that all
 respira-
    tory protective devices used in the workplace be certified
 by NIOSH.
    ********** NIOSH-approved HEPA respirators are the only
 currently
    available air-purifying respirators that meet or exceed the
 standard
    performance criteria stated above. However, the NIOSH
 certification
    procedures are currently being revised (153). Under the
 proposed
    revision, filter materials would be tested at a flow rate
 of 85 L/min
    for penetration by particles with a median aerodynamic
 diameter of
    0.3 um and, if certified, would be placed in one of the
 following
    categories: type A, which has greater than or equal to
 99.97%
    efficiency (similar to current HEPA filter media); type B,
 greater
    than or equal to 99% efficiency; or type C, greater than or
 equal to
    95% efficiency. According to this proposed scheme, type C
 filter
    material would meet or exceed the standard performance
 criteria
    specified in this document.  The facility's risk assessment may identify a limited
 number of
    selected settings (e.g., bronchoscopy performed on patients
 suspected
    of having TB or autopsy performed on deceased persons
 suspected of
    having had active TB at the time of death) where the
 estimated risk
    for transmission of M. tuberculosis may be such that a
 level of
    respiratory protection exceeding the standard criteria is
 appro-
    priate. In such circumstances, a level of respiratory
 protection
    exceeding the standard criteria and compatible with
 patient-care
    delivery (e.g., negative-pressure respirators that are more
 protec-
    tive; powered air-purifying particulate respirators
 {PAPRs}; or
    positive-pressure airline, half-mask respirators) should be
 provided
    by employers to HCWs who are exposed to M. tuberculosis.
 Information
    on these and other respirators may be found in the NIOSH
 Guide to
    Industrial Respiratory Protection (55).  
    The Effectiveness of Respiratory Protective Devices  The following information, which
is based on experience
 with respira-
    tory protection in the industrial setting, summarizes the
 available
    data about the effectiveness of respiratory protection
 against
    hazardous airborne materials. Data regarding protection
 against
    transmission of M. tuberculosis are not available.  The parameters used to determine
the effectiveness of a
 respiratory
    protective device are face-seal efficacy and filter
 efficacy.  
        Face-seal leakage  Face-seal leakage compromises the ability of
 particulate respira-
        tors to protect HCWs from airborne materials (154-156).
 A proper
        seal between the respirator's sealing surface and the
 face of the
        person wearing the respirator is essential for
 effective and
        reliable performance of any negative-pressure
 respirator. This
        seal is less critical, but still important, for
 positive-pressure
        respirators. Face-seal leakage can result from various
 factors,
        including incorrect facepiece size or shape, incorrect
 or
        defective facepiece sealing-lip, beard growth,
 perspiration or
        facial oils that can cause facepiece slippage, failure
 to use all
        the head straps, incorrect positioning of the facepiece
 on the
        face, incorrect head strap tension or position,
 improper respir-
        ator  maintenance,  and  respirator  damage.   Every  time  a  person  wearing  a
negative-pressure
 particulate
        respirator inhales, a negative pressure (relative to
 the
        workplace air) is created inside the facepiece. Because
 of this
        negative pressure, air containing contaminants can take
 a path of
        least resistance into the respirator -- through leaks
 at the
        face-seal interface -- thus avoiding the
 higher-resistance filter
        material. Currently available, cup-shaped, disposable
 particulate
        respirators have from 0 to 20% face-seal leakage
 (55,154). This
        face-seal leakage results from the variability of the
 human face
        and from limitations in the respirator's design,
 construction,
        and number of sizes available. The face-seal leakage is
 probably
        higher if the respirator is not fitted properly to the
 HCW's
        face, tested for an adequate fit by a qualified person,
 and then
        checked for fit by the HCW every time the respirator is
 put on.
        Face-seal leakage may be reduced to less than 10% with
 improve-
        ments in design, a greater variety in available sizes,
 and appro-
        priate  fit  testing  and  fit  checking.   In  comparison  with  negative-pressure
respirators,
 positive-
        pressure respirators produce a positive pressure inside
 the
        facepiece under most conditions of use. For example, in
 a PAPR,
        a blower forcibly draws ambient air through HEPA
 filters, then
        delivers the filtered air to the facepiece. This air is
 blown
        into the facepiece at flow rates that generally exceed
 the
        expected inhalation flow rates. The positive pressure
 inside the
        facepiece reduces face-seal leakage to low levels,
 particularly
        during the relatively low inhalation rates expected in
 health-
        care settings. PAPRs with a tight-fitting facepiece
 have less
        than 2% face-seal leakage under routine conditions
 (55). Powered-
        air respirators with loose-fitting facepieces, hoods,
 or helmets
        have less than 4% face-seal leakage under routine
 conditions
        (55). Thus, a PAPR may offer lower levels of face-seal
 leakage
        than nonpowered, half-mask respirators. Full facepiece,
 non-
        powered respirators have the same leakage (i.e., less
 than 2%) as
        PAPRs.  Another factor contributing to face-seal leakage of
 cup-shaped,
        disposable respirators is that some of these
 respirators are
        available in only one size. A single size may produce
 higher
        leakage for persons who have smaller or
 difficult-to-fit faces
        (157). The facepieces used for some reusable (including
 HEPA and
        replaceable filter, negative-pressure) and all
 positive-pressure
        particulate air-purifying respirators are available in
 as many as
        three different sizes.  
        Filter leakage  Aerosol leakage through respirator filters depends on
 at least
        five independent variables: a) the filtration
 characteristics for
        each type of filter, b) the size distribution of the
 droplets in
        the aerosol, c) the linear velocity through the
 filtering
        material, d) the filter loading (i.e., the amount of
 contaminant
        deposited on the filter), and e) any electrostatic
 charges on the
        filter and on the droplets in the aerosol (158).  When HEPA filters are used in
particulate air-purifying
        respirators, filter efficiency is so high (i.e.,
 effectively
        100%) that filter leakage is not a consideration.
 Therefore, for
        all HEPA-filter respirators, virtually all inward
 leakage of
        droplet nuclei occurs at the respirator's face seal.  
        Fit testing  Fit testing is part of the respiratory protection
 program
        required by OSHA for all respiratory protective devices
 used in
        the workplace. A fit test determines whether a
 respiratory
        protective device adequately fits a particular HCW. The
 HCW may
        need to be fit tested with several devices to determine
 which
        device offers the best fit. However, fit tests can
 detect only
        the leakage that occurs at the time of the fit testing,
 and the
        tests cannot distinguish face-seal leakage from filter
 leakage.  Determination of facepiece fit can involve qualitative
 or quanti-
        tative tests (55). A qualitative test relies on the
 subjective
        response of the HCW being fit tested. A quantitative
 test uses
        detectors to measure inward leakage.  Disposable, negative-pressure particulate
respirators
 can be
        qualitatively fit tested with aerosolized substances
 that can be
        tasted, although the results of this testing are
 limited because
        the tests depend on the subjective response of the HCW
 being
        tested. Quantitative fit testing of disposable
 negative-pressure
        particulate respirators can best be performed if the
 manufacturer
        provides a test respirator with a probe for this
 purpose.  Replaceable filter, negative-pressure particulate
 respirators and
        all positive-pressure particulate respirators can be
 fit tested
        reliably, both qualitatively and quantitatively, when
 fitted with
        HEPA filters.  
        Fit checking  A fit check is a maneuver that an HCW performs before
 each use of
        the respiratory protective device to check the fit. The
 fit check
        can be performed according to the manufacturer's
 facepiece
        fitting instructions by using the applicable
 negative-pressure or
        positive-pressure test.  Some currently available cup-shaped, disposable
 negative-pressure
        particulate respirators cannot be fit checked reliably
 by persons
        wearing the devices because occluding the entire
 surface of the
        filter is difficult. Strategies for overcoming these
 limitations
        are being developed by respirator manufacturers.  
        Reuse of respirators  Conscientious respirator maintenance should be an
 integral part
        of an overall respirator program. This maintenance
 applies both
        to respirators with replaceable filters and respirators
 that are
        classified as disposable but that are reused.
 Manufacturers'
        instructions for inspecting, cleaning, and maintaining
 respira-
        tors should be followed to ensure that the respirator
 continues
        to function properly (55).  When respirators are used for protection against
 noninfectious
        aerosols (e.g., wood dust), which may be present in the
 air in
        heavy concentrations, the filter material may become
 occluded
        with airborne material. This occlusion may result in an
 uncom-
        fortable breathing resistance. In health-care settings
 where
        respirators are used for protection against biological
 aerosols,
        the concentration of infectious particles in the air is
 probably
        low; thus, the filter material in a respirator is very
 unlikely
        to become occluded with airborne material. In addition,
 there is
        no evidence that particles impacting on the filter
 material in a
        respirator are re-aerosolized easily. For these
 reasons, the
        filter material used in respirators in the health-care
 setting
        should remain functional for weeks to months.
 Respirators with
        replaceable filters are reusable, and a respirator
 classified as
        disposable may be reused by the same HCW as long as it
 remains
        functional.  Before each use, the outside of the filter material
 should be
        inspected. If the filter material is physically damaged
 or
        soiled, the filter should be changed (in the case of
 respirators
        with replaceable filters) or the respirator discarded
 (in the
        case of disposable respirators). Infection-control
 personnel
        should develop standard operating procedures for
 storing,
        reusing, and disposing of respirators that have been
 designated
        as disposable and for disposing of replaceable filter
 elements.   Implementing  a  Personal  Respiratory  Protection  Program   If  personal
respiratory protection is used in a health-care
 setting, OSHA
requires that an effective personal respiratory protection
 program be
developed, implemented, administered, and periodically
 reevaluated
(54,55).  All HCWs who need to use respirators for protection against
 infection
with M. tuberculosis should be included in the respiratory
 protection
program. Visitors to TB patients should be given respirators to
 wear
while in isolation rooms, and they should be given general
 instructions
on  how  to  use  their  respirators.   The  number  of  HCWs  included  in  the  respiratory
protection
 program in each
facility will vary depending on a) the number of potentially
 infectious
TB patients, b) the number of rooms or areas to which patients
 with
suspected or confirmed infectious TB are admitted, and c) the
 number of
HCWs needed in these rooms or areas. Where respiratory
 protection
programs are required, they should include enough HCWs to
 provide
adequate care for a patient with known or suspected TB should
 such a
patient be admitted to the facility. However, administrative
 measures
should be used to limit the number of HCWs who need to enter
 these rooms
or areas, thus limiting the number of HCWs who need to be
 included in the
respiratory  protection  program.   Information  regarding  the  development  and
management of a
 respiratory
protection program is available in technical training courses
 that cover
the basics of personal respiratory protection. Such courses are
 offered
by various organizations, such as NIOSH, OSHA, and the American
 Indus-
trial Hygiene Association. Similar courses are available from
 private
contractors  and  universities.   To  be  effective  and  reliable,  respiratory  protection
programs
 must
contain at least the following elements (55,154):  
    Assignment of responsibility. Supervisory responsibility
 for the
    respiratory protection program should be assigned to
 designated
    persons who have expertise in issues relevant to the
 program,
    including infectious diseases and occupational health.  
    Standard operating procedures. Written standard
 operating
    procedures should contain information concerning all
 aspects of the
    respiratory protection program.  
    Medical screening. HCWs should not be assigned a task
 requiring
    use of respirators unless they are physically able to
 perform the
    task while wearing the respirator. HCWs should be screened
 for
    pertinent medical conditions at the time they are hired,
 then
    rescreened periodically (55). The screening could occur as
 infre-
    quently as every 5 years. The screening process should
 begin with a
    general screening (e.g., a questionnaire) for pertinent
 medical
    conditions, and the results of the screening should then be
 used to
    identify HCWs who need further evaluation. Routine physical
 examin-
    ation or testing with chest radiographs or spirometry is
 not
    necessary or required.  Few medical conditions preclude the use of most
 negative-pressure
    particulate respirators. HCWs who have mild pulmonary or
 cardiac
    conditions may report discomfort with breathing when
 wearing
    negative-pressure particulate respirators, but these
 respirators are
    unlikely to have adverse health effects on the HCWs. Those
 HCWs who
    have more severe cardiac or pulmonary conditions may have
 more diffi-
    culty than HCWs with similar but milder conditions if
 performing
    duties while wearing negative-pressure respirators.
 Furthermore,
    these HCWs may be unable to use some PAPRs because of the
 added
    weight of these respirators.  
    Training. HCWs who wear respirators and the persons who
 supervise
    them should be informed about the necessity for wearing
 respirators
    and the potential risks associated with not doing so. This
 training
    should also include at a minimum:  
        The nature, extent, and specific hazards of M.
 tuberculosis
        transmission in their respective health-care facility.  
        A description of specific risks for TB infection among
 persons
        exposed to M. tuberculosis, of any subsequent treatment
 with INH
        or other chemoprophylactic agents, and of the
 possibility of
        active TB disease.  
        A description of engineering controls and work
 practices and the
        reasons why they do not eliminate the need for personal
 respira-
        tory protection.  
        An explanation for selecting a particular type of
 respirator, how
        the respirator is properly maintained and stored, and
 the opera-
        tion, capabilities, and limitations of the respirator
 provided.  
        Instruction in how the HCW wearing the respirator
 should inspect,
        put on, fit check, and correctly wear the provided
 respirator
        (i.e., achieve and maintain proper face-seal fit on the
 HCW's
        face).  
        An opportunity to handle the provided respirator and
 learn how to
        put it on, wear it properly, and check the important
 parts.  
        Instruction in how to recognize an inadequately
 functioning
        respirator.  5. Face-seal fit testing and fit checking. HCWs should
 undergo fit
        testing to identify a respirator that adequately fits each
 individual
        HCW. The HCW should receive fitting instructions that
 include demon-
        strations and practice in how the respirator should be
 worn, how it
        should be adjusted, and how to determine if it fits
 properly. The HCW
        should be taught to check the facepiece fit before each
 use.  6. Respirator inspection, cleaning, maintenance, and
 storage. Consci-
        entious respirator maintenance should be an integral part
 of an
        overall respirator program. This maintenance applies both
 to respir-
        ators with replaceable filters and respirators that are
 classified as
        disposable but that are reused. Manufacturers' instructions
 for
        inspecting, cleaning, and maintaining respirators should be
 followed
        to ensure that the respirator continues to function
 properly (55).  7. Periodic evaluation of the personal respiratory
 protection
        program. The program should be evaluated completely at
 least once a
        year, and both the written operating procedures and program
 adminis-
        tration should be revised as necessary based on the results
 of the
        evaluation. Elements of the program that should be
 evaluated include
        work practices and employee acceptance of respirator use
 (i.e.,
        subjective comments made by employees concerning comfort
 during use
        and  interference  with  duties).   Supplement  5:  Decontamination  --  Cleaning,
Disinfecting, and
 Sterilizing of
Patient-Care  Equipment   Equipment  used  on  patients  who  have  TB  is  usually  not
involved in
 the trans-
mission of M. tuberculosis, although transmission by contaminated
 broncho-
scopes has been demonstrated (159,160). Guidelines for cleaning,
 disin-
fecting, and sterilizing equipment have been published (161,162).
 The
rationale for cleaning, disinfecting, or sterilizing patient-care
 equipment
can be understood more readily if medical devices, equipment, and
 surgical
materials are divided into three general categories. These
 categories --
critical, semicritical, and noncritical items -- are defined by the
 potential
risk for infection associated with their use (163,164).  Critical items are instruments that
are introduced directly into
 the blood-
stream or into other normally sterile areas of the body (e.g.,
 needles,
surgical instruments, cardiac catheters, and implants). These items
 should be
sterile at the time of use.  Semicritical items are those that may come in contact with
mucous
 membranes
but do not ordinarily penetrate body surfaces (e.g., noninvasive
 flexible and
rigid fiberoptic endoscopes or bronchoscopes, endotracheal tubes,
 and anes-
thesia breathing circuits). Although sterilization is preferred for
 these
instruments, high-level disinfection that destroys vegetative
 microorganisms,
most fungal spores, tubercle bacilli, and small nonlipid viruses
 may be used.
Meticulous physical cleaning of such items before sterilization or
 high-level
disinfection is essential.  Noncritical items are those that either do not ordinarily touch
the
 patient
or touch only the patient's intact skin (e.g., crutches, bedboards,
 blood
pressure cuffs, and various other medical accessories). These items
 are not
associated with direct transmission of M. tuberculosis, and washing
 them with
detergent  is  usually  sufficient.   Health-care  facility  policies  should  specify  whether
cleaning,
 disinfecting,
or sterilizing an item is necessary to decrease the risk for
 infection.
Decisions about decontamination processes should be based on the
 intended use
of the item, not on the diagnosis of the patient for whom the item
 was used.
Selection of chemical disinfectants depends on the intended use,
 the level of
disinfection required, and the structure and material of the item
 to be
disinfected.  Although microorganisms are ordinarily found on walls, floors, and
 other
environmental surfaces, these surfaces are rarely associated with
 trans-
mission of infections to patients or HCWs. This is particularly
 true with
organisms such as M. tuberculosis, which generally require
 inhalation by the
host for infection to occur. Therefore, extraordinary attempts to
 disinfect
or sterilize environmental surfaces are not indicated. If a
 detergent
germicide is used for routine cleaning, a hospital-grade,
 EPA-approved
germicide/disinfectant that is not tuberculocidal can be used. The
 same
routine daily cleaning procedures used in other rooms in the
 facility should
be used to clean TB isolation rooms, and personnel should follow
 isolation
practices while cleaning these rooms. For final cleaning of the
 isolation
room after a patient has been discharged, personal protective
 equipment is
not necessary if the room has been ventilated for the appropriate
 amount of
time (Table_S31).  References

** Area: a structural unit (e.g., a hospital ward or laboratory) or
 func-
tional unit (e.g., an internal medicine service) in which HCWs
 provide
services to and share air with a specific patient population or
 work with
clinical specimens that may contain viable M. tuberculosis
 organisms. The
risk for exposure to M. tuberculosis in a given area depends on the
 preva-
lence of TB in the population served and the characteristics of the
 environ-
ment. 
*** Cluster: two or more PPD skin-test conversions occurring within

**** Surgical masks are designed to prevent the respiratory
 secretions of the
person wearing the mask from entering the air. When not in a TB
 isolation
room, patients suspected of having TB should wear surgical masks to
 reduce
the expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air. These patients do not
 need to
wear particulate respirators, which are designed to filter the air
 before it
is inhaled by the person wearing the mask. Patients suspected of
 having or
known to have TB should never wear a respirator that has an
 exhalation valve,
because the device would provide no barrier to the expulsion of
 droplet
nuclei into the air. 
***** Some filters become more efficient as they become loaded with
 dust.
Health-care settings do not have enough dust in the air to load a
 filter on
a respirator. Therefore, the filter efficiency for respirators used
 in
health-care settings must be determined in the unloaded state.

Glossary 
This glossary contains many of the terms used in the guidelines, as
 well as
others that are encountered frequently by persons who implement TB
 infection-
control programs. The definitions given are not dictionary
 definitions but
are those most applicable to usage relating to TB. 
Acid-fast bacilli (AFB): Bacteria that retain certain dyes after
 being washed 
in an acid solution. Most acid-fast organisms are
 mycobacteria. When AFB
are seen on a stained smear of sputum or other clinical
 specimen, a
diagnosis of TB should be suspected; however, the diagnosis of
 TB is not
confirmed until a culture is grown and identified as M.
 tuberculosis. 
Adherence: Refers to the behavior of patients when they follow all
 aspects of 
the treatment regimen as prescribed by the medical provider,
 and also
refers to the behavior of HCWs and employers when they follow
 all
guidelines pertaining to infection control. 
Aerosol: The droplet nuclei that are expelled by an infectious
 person (e.g., 
by coughing or sneezing); these droplet nuclei can remain
 suspended in
the air and can transmit M. tuberculosis to other persons. 
AIA: The American Institute of Architects, a professional body that
 develops 
standards for building ventilation. 
Air changes: The ratio of the volume of air flowing through a space
 in a 
certain period of time (i.e., the airflow rate) to the volume
 of that
space (i.e., the room volume); this ratio is usually expressed
 as the
number of air changes per hour (ACH). 
Air mixing: The degree to which air supplied to a room mixes with
 the air 
already in the room, usually expressed as a mixing factor.
 This factor
varies from 1 (for perfect mixing) to 10 (for poor mixing),
 and it is
used as a multiplier to determine the actual airflow required
 (i.e., the
recommended ACH multiplied by the mixing factor equals the
 actual ACH
required). 
Alveoli: The small air sacs in the lungs that lie at the end of the
 bronchial 
tree; the site where carbon dioxide in the blood is replaced
 by oxygen
from the lungs and where TB infection usually begins. 
Anergy: The inability of a person to react to skin-test antigens
 (even if the 
person is infected with the organisms tested) because of
 immunosuppres-
sion. 
Anteroom: A small room leading from a corridor into an isolation
 room; this 
room can act as an airlock, preventing the escape of
 contaminants from
the isolation room into the corridor. 
Area: A structural unit (e.g., a hospital ward or laboratory) or
 functional 
unit (e.g., an internal medicine service) in which HCWs
 provide services
to and share air with a specific patient population or work
 with
clinical specimens that may contain viable M. tuberculosis
 organisms.
The risk for exposure to M. tuberculosis in a given area
 depends on the
prevalence of TB in the population served and the
 characteristics of the
environment. 
ASHRAE: The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and
 Air-Conditioning 
Engineers, Inc., a professional body that develops standards
 for
building ventilation. 
Asymptomatic: Without symptoms, or producing no symptoms. 
Bacillus of Calmette and Gu,rin (BCG) vaccine: A TB vaccine used in
 many 
parts of the world. 
BACTEC (R):  One  of the most often used radiometric methods for
 detecting 
the early growth of mycobacteria in culture. It provides rapid
 growth
(in 7-14 days) and rapid drug-susceptibility testing (in 5-6
 days). When
BACTEC (R) is used with rapid species identification methods,
 M. tuber-
culosis can be identified within 10-14 days of specimen
 collection. 
Booster phenomenon: A phenomenon in which some persons (especially
 older 
adults) who are skin tested many years after infection with M.
 tuber-
culosis have a negative reaction to an initial skin test,
 followed by a
positive reaction to a subsequent skin test. The second (i.e.,
 positive)
reaction is caused by a boosted immune response. Two-step
 testing is
used to distinguish new infections from boosted reactions (see
 Two-step
testing). 
Bronchoscopy: A procedure for examining the respiratory tract that
 requires 
inserting an instrument (a bronchoscope) through the mouth or
 nose and
into the trachea. The procedure can be used to obtain
 diagnostic
specimens. 
Capreomycin: An injectable, second-line anti-TB drug used primarily
 for the 
treatment of drug-resistant TB. 
Cavity: A hole in the lung resulting from the destruction of
 pulmonary tissue 
by TB or other pulmonary infections or conditions. TB patients
 who have
cavities in their lungs are referred to as having cavitary
 disease, and
they are often more infectious than TB patients without
 cavitary
disease. 
Chemotherapy: Treatment of an infection or disease by means of oral
 or 
injectable drugs. 
Cluster: Two or more PPD skin-test conversions occurring within a
 3-month 
period among HCWs in a specific area or occupational group,
 and epidemi-
ologic evidence suggests occupational (nosocomial)
 transmission. 
Contact: A person who has shared the same air with a person who has
 infec- 
tious TB for a sufficient amount of time to allow possible
 transmission
of M. tuberculosis. 
Conversion, PPD: See PPD test conversion. 
Culture: The process of growing bacteria in the laboratory so that
 organisms 
can be identified. 
Cycloserine: A second-line, oral anti-TB drug used primarily for
 treating 
drug-resistant TB. 
Directly observed therapy (DOT): An adherence-enhancing strategy in
 which an 
HCW or other designated person watches the patient swallow
 each dose of
medication. 
DNA probe: A technique that allows rapid and precise identification
 of myco- 
bacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis and M. bovis) that are grown
 in culture.
The identification can often be completed in 2 hours. 
Droplet nuclei: Microscopic particles (i.e., 1-5 mm in diameter)
 produced 
when a person coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings. The droplets
 produced
by an infectious TB patient can carry tubercle bacilli and can
 remain
suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time and be
 carried on
normal air currents in the room. 
Drug resistance, acquired: A resistance to one or more anti-TB
 drugs that 
develops while a patient is receiving therapy and which
 usually results
from the patient's nonadherence to therapy or the prescription
 of an
inadequate regimen by a health-care provider. 
Drug resistance, primary: A resistance to one or more anti-TB drugs
 that 
exists before a patient is treated with the drug(s). Primary
 resistance
occurs in persons exposed to and infected with a
 drug-resistant strain
of M. tuberculosis. 
Drug-susceptibility pattern: The anti-TB drugs to which the
 tubercle bacilli 
cultured from a TB patient are susceptible or resistant based
 on drug-
susceptibility tests. 
Drug-susceptibility tests: Laboratory tests that determine whether
 the 
tubercle bacilli cultured from a patient are susceptible or
 resistant to
various anti-TB drugs. 
Ethambutol: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug sometimes used
 concomitantly with 
INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. 
Ethionamide: A second-line, oral anti-TB drug used primarily for
 treating 
drug-resistant TB. 
Exposure: The condition of being subjected to something (e.g.,
 infectious 
agents) that could have a harmful effect. A person exposed to
 M. tuber-
culosis does not necessarily become infected (see
 Transmission). 
First-line drugs: The most often used anti-TB drugs (i.e., INH,
 rifampin, 
pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and streptomycin). 
Fixed room-air HEPA recirculation systems: Nonmobile devices or
 systems that 
remove airborne contaminants by recirculating air through a
 HEPA filter.
These may be built into the room and permanently ducted or may
 be
mounted to the wall or ceiling within the room. In either
 situation,
they are fixed in place and are not easily movable. 
Fluorochrome stain: A technique for staining a clinical specimen
 with 
fluorescent dyes to perform a microscopic examination (smear)
 for myco-
bacteria. This technique is preferable to other staining
 techniques
because the mycobacteria can be seen easily and the slides can
 be read
quickly. 
Fomites: Linens, books, dishes, or other objects used or touched by
 a 
patient. These objects are not involved in the transmission of
 M. tuber-
culosis. 
Gastric aspirate: A procedure sometimes used to obtain a specimen
 for culture 
when a patient cannot cough up adequate sputum. A tube is
 inserted
through the mouth or nose and into the stomach to recover
 sputum that
was coughed into the throat and then swallowed. This procedure
 is
particularly useful for diagnosis in children, who are often
 unable to
cough up sputum. 
High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: A specialized filter
 that is 
capable of removing 99.97% of particles 30.3 mm in diameter
 and that may
assist in controlling the transmission of M. tuberculosis.
 Filters may
be used in ventilation systems to remove particles from the
 air or in
personal respirators to filter air before it is inhaled by the
 person
wearing the respirator. The use of HEPA filters in ventilation
 systems
requires expertise in installation and maintenance. 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection: Infection with the
 virus that 
causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV
 infection is the
most important risk factor for the progression of latent TB
 infection to
active TB. 
Immunosuppressed: A condition in which the immune system is not
 functioning 
normally (e.g., severe cellular immunosuppression resulting
 from HIV
infection or immunosuppressive therapy). Immunosuppressed
 persons are at
greatly increased risk for developing active TB after they
 have been
infected with M. tuberculosis. No data are available regarding
 whether
these persons are also at increased risk for infection with M.
 tuber-
culosis after they have been exposed to the organism. 
Induration: An area of swelling produced by an immune response to
 an antigen. 
In tuberculin skin testing or anergy testing, the diameter of
 the
indurated area is measured 48-72 hours after the injection,
 and the
result is recorded in millimeters. 
Infection: The condition in which organisms capable of causing
 disease (e.g., 
M. tuberculosis) enter the body and elicit a response from the
 host' s
immune defenses. TB infection may or may not lead to clinical
 disease. 
Infectious: Capable of transmitting infection. When persons who
 have 
clinically active pulmonary or laryngeal TB disease cough or
 sneeze,
they can expel droplets containing M. tuberculosis into the
 air. Persons
whose sputum smears are positive for AFB are probably
 infectious. 
Injectable: A medication that is usually administered by injection
 into the 
muscle (intramuscular {IM}) or the bloodstream (intravenous
 {IV}). 
Intermittent therapy: Therapy administered either two or three
 times per 
week, rather than daily. Intermittent therapy should be
 administered
only under the direct supervision of an HCW or other
 designated person
(see Directly observed therapy {DOT}). 
Intradermal: Within the layers of the skin. 
Isoniazid (INH): A first-line, oral drug used either alone as
 preventive 
therapy or in combination with several other drugs to treat TB
 disease. 
Kanamycin: An injectable, second-line anti-TB drug used primarily
 for treat- 
ment of drug-resistant TB. 
Latent TB infection: Infection with M. tuberculosis, usually
 detected by a 
positive PPD skin-test result, in a person who has no symptoms
 of active
TB and who is not infectious. 
Mantoux test: A method of skin testing that is performed by
 injecting 0.1 mL 
of PPD-tuberculin containing 5 tuberculin units into the
 dermis (i.e.,
the second layer of skin) of the forearm with a needle and
 syringe. This
test is the most reliable and standardized technique for
 tuberculin
testing (see Tuberculin skin test and Purified protein
 derivative {PPD}-
tuberculin test). 
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB): Active TB caused by M.
 tuber- 
culosis organisms that are resistant to more than one anti-TB
 drug; in
practice, often refers to organisms that are resistant to both
 INH and
rifampin with or without resistance to other drugs (see Drug
 resistance,
acquired and Drug resistance, primary). 
M. tuberculosis complex: A group of closely related mycobacterial
 species 
that can cause active TB (e.g., M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and
 M.
africanum); most TB in the United States is caused by M.
 tuberculosis. 
Negative pressure: The relative air pressure difference between two
 areas in 
a health-care facility. A room that is at negative pressure
 has a lower
pressure than adjacent areas, which keeps air from flowing out
 of the
room and into adjacent rooms or areas. 
Nosocomial: An occurrence, usually an infection, that is acquired
 in a 
hospital or as a result of medical care. 
Para-aminosalicylic acid: A second-line, oral anti-TB drug used for
 treating 
drug-resistant TB. 
Pathogenesis: The pathologic, physiologic, or biochemical process
 by which a 
disease develops. 
Pathogenicity: The quality of producing or the ability to produce
 pathologic 
changes or disease.  Some nontuberculous mycobacteria are
 pathogenic
(e.g., Mycobacterium kansasii), and others are not (e.g.,
 Mycobacterium
phlei). 
Portable room-air HEPA recirculation units: Free-standing portable
 devices 
that remove airborne contaminants by recirculating air through
 a HEPA
filter. 
Positive PPD reaction: A reaction to the purified protein
 derivative (PPD)- 
tuberculin skin test that suggests the person tested is
 infected with M.
tuberculosis. The person interpreting the skin-test reaction
 determines
whether it is positive on the basis of the size of the
 induration and
the medical history and risk factors of the person being
 tested. 
Preventive therapy: Treatment of latent TB infection used to
 prevent the 
progression of latent infection to clinically active disease. 
Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin: A purified tuberculin
 prepar- 
ation that was developed in the 1930s and that was derived
 from old
tuberculin. The standard Mantoux test uses 0.1 mL of PPD
 standardized to
5 tuberculin units. 
Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin test: A method used to
 evaluate 
the likelihood that a person is infected with M. tuberculosis.
 A small
dose of tuberculin (PPD) is injected just beneath the surface
 of the
skin, and the area is examined 48-72 hours after the
 injection. A
reaction is measured according to the size of the induration.
 The
classification of a reaction as positive or negative depends
 on the
patient's medical history and various risk factors (see
 Mantoux test). 
Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin test conversion: A
 change in PPD 
test results  from negative to positive. A conversion within a
 2-year
period is usually interpreted as new M. tuberculosis
 infection, which
carries an increased risk for progression to active disease. A
 booster
reaction may be misinterpreted as a new infection (see Booster
phenomenon and Two-step testing). 
Pyrazinamide: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug used in treatment
 regimens. 
Radiography: A method of viewing the respiratory system by using
 radiation to 
transmit an image of the respiratory system to film. A chest
 radiograph
is taken to view the respiratory system of a person who is
 being
evaluated for pulmonary TB. Abnormalities (e.g., lesions or
 cavities in
the lungs and enlarged lymph nodes) may indicate the presence
 of TB. 
Radiometric method: A method for culturing a specimen that allows
 for rapid 
detection of bacterial growth by measuring production of CO2
 by viable
organisms; also a method of rapidly performing susceptibility
 testing of
M. tuberculosis. 
Recirculation: Ventilation in which all or most of the air that is
 exhausted 
from an area is returned to the same area or other areas of
 the
facility. 
Regimen: Any particular TB treatment plan that specifies which
 drugs are 
used, in what doses, according to what schedule, and for how
 long. 
Registry: A record-keeping method for collecting clinical,
 laboratory, and 
radiographic data concerning TB patients so that the data can
 be
organized and made available for epidemiologic study. 
Resistance: The ability of some strains of bacteria, including M.
 tuber- 
culosis, to grow and multiply in the presence of certain drugs
 that
ordinarily kill them; such strains are referred to as
 drug-resistant
strains. 
Rifampin: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug that, when used
 concomitantly with 
INH and pyrazinamide, provides the basis for short-course
 therapy. 
Room-air HEPA recirculation systems and units: Devices (either
 fixed or 
portable) that remove airborne contaminants by recirculating
 air through
a HEPA filter. 
Second-line drugs: Anti-TB drugs used when the first-line drugs
 cannot be 
used (e.g., for drug-resistant TB or because of adverse
 reactions to the
first-line drugs). Examples are cycloserine, ethionamide, and
capreomycin. 
Single-pass ventilation: Ventilation in which 100% of the air
 supplied to an 
area is exhausted to the outside. 
Smear (AFB smear): A laboratory technique for visualizing
 mycobacteria. The 
specimen is smeared onto a slide and stained, then examined
 using a
microscope. Smear results should be available within 24 hours.
 In TB, a
large number of myco-bacteria seen on an AFB smear usually
 indicates
infectiousness. However, a positive result is not diagnostic
 of TB
because organisms other than M. tuberculosis may be seen on an
 AFB smear
(e.g., nontuberculous mycobacteria). 
Source case: A case of TB in an infectious person who has
 transmitted M. 
tuberculosis to another person or persons. 
Source control: Controlling a contaminant at the source of its
 generation, 
which prevents the spread of the contaminant to the general
 work space. 
Specimen: Any body fluid, secretion, or tissue sent to a laboratory
 where 
smears and cultures for M. tuberculosis will be performed
 (e.g., sputum,
urine, spinal fluid, and material obtained at biopsy). 
Sputum: Phlegm coughed up from deep within the lungs. If a patient
 has 
pulmonary disease, an examination of the sputum by smear and
 culture can
be helpful in evaluating the organism responsible for the
 infection.
Sputum should not be confused with saliva or nasal secretions.
 
Sputum induction: A method used to obtain sputum from a patient who
 is unable 
to cough up a specimen spontaneously. The patient inhales a
 saline mist,
which stimulates a cough from deep within the lungs. 
Sputum smear, positive: AFB are visible on the sputum smear when
 viewed under 
a microscope. Persons with a sputum smear positive for AFB are
considered more infectious than those with smear-negative
 sputum. 
Streptomycin: A first-line, injectable anti-TB drug. 
Symptomatic: Having symptoms that may indicate the presence of TB
 or another 
disease (see Asymptomatic). 
TB case: A particular episode of clinically active TB. This term
 should be 
used only to refer to the disease itself, not the patient with
 the
disease. By law, cases of TB must be reported to the local
 health
department. 
TB infection: A condition in which living tubercle bacilli are
 present in the 
body but the disease is not clinically active. Infected
 persons usually
have positive tuberculin reactions, but they have no symptoms
 related to
the infection and are not infectious. However, infected
 persons remain
at lifelong risk for developing disease unless preventive
 therapy is
given. 
Transmission: The spread of an infectious agent from one person to
 another. 
The likelihood of transmission is directly related to the
 duration and
intensity of exposure to M. tuberculosis (see Exposure). 
Treatment failures: TB disease in patients who do not respond to
 chemotherapy 
and in patients whose disease worsens after having improved
 initially. 
Tubercle bacilli: M. tuberculosis organisms. 
Tuberculin skin test: A method used to evaluate the likelihood that
 a person 
is infected with M. tuberculosis. A small dose of
 PPD-tuberculin is
injected just beneath the surface of the skin, and the area is
 examined
48-72 hours after the injection. A reaction is measured
 according to the
size of the induration. The classification of a reaction as
 positive or
negative depends on the patient's medical history and various
 risk
factors (see Mantoux test, PPD test). 
Tuberculosis (TB): A clinically active, symptomatic disease caused
 by an 
organism in the  M. tuberculosis complex (usually M.
 tuberculosis or,
rarely, M. bovis or M. africanum). 
Two-step testing: A procedure used for the baseline testing of
 persons who 
will periodically receive tuberculin skin tests (e.g., HCWs)
 to reduce
the likelihood of mistaking a boosted reaction for a new
 infection. If
the initial tuberculin-test result is classified as negative,
 a second
test is repeated 1-3 weeks later. If the reaction to the
 second test is
positive, it probably represents a boosted reaction. If the
 second test
result is also negative, the person is classified as not
 infected. A
positive reaction to a subsequent test would indicate new
 infection
(i.e., a skin-test conversion) in such a person. 
Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI): The use of ultraviolet
 radiation 
to kill or inactivate microorganisms. 
Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) lamps: Lamps that kill or
 
inactivate microorganisms by emitting ultraviolet germicidal
 radiation,
predominantly at a wavelength of 254 nm (intermediate light
 waves
between visible light and X-rays). UVGI lamps can be used in
 ceiling or
wall fixtures or within air ducts of ventilation systems. 
Ventilation, dilution: An engineering control technique to dilute
 and remove 
airborne contaminants by the flow of air into and out of an
 area. Air
that contains droplet nuclei is removed and replaced by
 contaminant-free
air. If the flow is sufficient, droplet nuclei become
 dispersed, and
their concentration in the air is diminished. 
Ventilation, local exhaust: Ventilation used to capture and remove
 airborne 
contaminants by enclosing the contaminant source (i.e., the
 patient) or
by placing an exhaust hood close to the contaminant source. 
Virulence: The degree of pathogenicity of a microorganism as
 indicated by the 
severity of the disease produced and its ability to invade the
 tissues
of a host. M. tuberculosis is a virulent organism.

TABLE 1. Elements of a risk assessment for tuberculosis (TB) in health-care facilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Review the community TB profile (from public health department data).
2. Review the number of TB patients who were treated in each area of the facility (both
   inpatient and outpatient). (This information can be obtained by analyzing laboratory
   surveillance data and by reviewing discharge diagnoses or medical and infection-
   control records.)
3. Review the drug-susceptibility patterns of TB isolates of patients who were treated at
   the facility.
4. Analyze purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin-test results of health-care
   workers (HCWs), by area or by occupational group for HCWs not assigned to a specific
   area (e.g., respiratory therapists).
5. To evaluate infection-control parameters, review medical records of a sample of TB
   patients seen at the facility.
   Calculate intervals from:
   - admission until TB suspected;
   - admission until TB evaluation performed;
   - admission until acid-fast bacilli (AFB) specimens ordered;
   - AFB specimens ordered until AFB specimens collected;
   - AFB specimens collected until AFB smears performed and reported;
   - AFB specimens collected until cultures performed and reported;
   - AFB specimens collected until species identification conducted and reported;
   - AFB specimens collected until drug-susceptibility tests performed and reported;
   - admission until TB isolation initiated;
   - admission until TB treatment initiated; and
   - duration of TB isolation.
   Obtain the following additional information:
   - Were appropriate criteria used for discontinuing isolation?
   - Did the patient have a history of prior admission to the facility?
   - Was the TB treatment regimen adequate?
   - Were follow-up sputum specimens collected properly?
   - Was appropriate discharge planning conducted?
6. Perform an observational review of TB infection control practices.
7. Review the most recent environmental evaluation and maintenance procedures.

  *  Because  very  low-risk  facilities  do  not  admit  patients  who  may  have  active  TB  to
inpatient areas, most HCWs in such facilities do
    not  need  routine  follow-up  PPD  screening  after  baseline  PPD  testing  is  done.
However, those who are involved in the initial
    assessment  and  diagnostic  evaluation  of  patients  in  the  ambulatory-care,
emergency, and admitting departments of such facilities
    or  in  the  outpatient  management  of  patients  with  active  TB  could  be  exposed
potentially to a patient who has active TB. These
    HCWs may need to receive routine periodic PPD screening. Similarly, these HCWs
may need to be included in a respiratory protection
    program.
  + Because very low-risk facilities do not admit patients suspected of having active TB,
review of TB patient medical records is not
    applicable.  However,  follow-up  of  patients  who  were  identified  during  triage  as
possibly having active TB and referred to another
    institution for further evaluation and management may be useful in evaluating the
effectiveness of the triage system.
  & Some minimal or very low-risk facilities may elect to use engineering controls (e.g.,
booths for cough-inducing procedures, portable
    high-efficiency  particulate  {HEPA}  filtration  units,  ultraviolet  germicidal  irradiation
units) in triage/waiting areas. In such situations,
    appropriate  protocols  for  maintaining  this  equipment  should  be  in  place,  and  this
maintenance should be evaluated periodically.
  @ The criteria used in clinical prediction rules will probably vary from facility to facility
depending on the prevalence of TB in the
    population  served  by  the  facility  and  on  the  clinical,  radiographic,  and  laboratory
characteristics of TB patients examined in the
    facility.
 **  The  protocols  should  be  consistent  with  CDC/American  Thoracic  Society
recommendations (33).
 ++  Protocols  for  referring  patients  who  require  specialized  treatment  (e.g.,  patients
with multidrug-resistant TB) may be appropriate.
 && Based on maximum daily number of patients requiring TB isolation for suspected or
confirmed active TB. Isolation rooms should
    meet the performance criteria specified in these guidelines.
 @@ If such procedures are used in the triage protocol(s) for identifying patients who
may have active TB.
*** Minimal-risk facilities do not need to maintain an ongoing PPD skin-testing program.
However, baseline PPD testing of HCWs may
    be  advisable  so  that  if  an  unexpected  exposure  does  occur,  conversions  can  be
distinguished from positive PPD test results caused
    by previous exposures.

TABLE 3. Characteristics of an effective tuberculosis (TB) infection-control program *
====================================================
=============================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I. Assignment of responsibility
      A. Assign responsibility for the TB infection-control program to qualified person(s).
      B. Ensure that persons with expertise in infection control, occupational health, and
         engineering are identified and included.
  II. Risk assessment, TB infection-control plan, and periodic reassessment
      A. Initial risk assessments
         1. Obtain information concerning TB in the community.
         2. Evaluate data concerning TB patients in the facility.
         3. Evaluate data concerning purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin-test
            conversions among health-care workers (HCWs) in the facility.
         4. Rule out evidence of person-to-person transmission.
      B. Written TB infection-control program
         1. Select initial risk protocol(s).
         2. Develop written TB infection-control protocols.
      C. Repeat risk assessment at appropriate intervals.
         1. Review current community and facility surveillance data and PPD-tuberculin
            skin-test results.
         2. Review records of TB patients.
         3. Observe HCW infection-control practices.
         4. Evaluate maintenance of engineering controls.
 III. Identification, evaluation, and treatment of patients who have TB
      A. Screen patients for signs and symptoms of active TB:
         1. On initial encounter in emergency department or ambulatory-care setting.
         2. Before or at the time of admission.
      B. Perform radiologic and bacteriologic evaluation of patients who have signs and
         symptoms suggestive of TB.
      C. Promptly initiate treatment.
  IV. Managing outpatients who have possible infectious TB
      A. Promptly initiate TB precautions.
      B. Place patients in separate waiting areas or TB isolation rooms.
      C. Give patients a surgical mask, a box of tissues, and instructions regarding the
use
         of these items.
   V. Managing inpatients who have possible infectious TB
      A. Promptly isolate patients who have suspected or known infectious TB.
      B. Monitor the response to treatment.
      C. Follow appropriate criteria for discontinuing isolation.
  VI. Engineering recommendations
      A. Design local exhaust and general ventilation in collaboration with persons who
         have expertise in ventilation engineering.
      B. Use a single-pass air system or air recirculation after high-efficiency particulate
air
         (HEPA) filtration in areas where infectious TB patients receive care.
      C. Use additional measures, if needed, in areas where TB patients may receive care.
      D. Design TB isolation rooms in health-care facilities to achieve greater than or
         equal to 6 air changes per hour (ACH) for existing facilities and greater than
         or equal to 12 ACH for new or renovated facilities.
      E. Regularly monitor and maintain engineering controls.
      F. TB isolation rooms that are being used should be monitored daily to ensure they
         maintain negative pressure relative to the hallway and all surrounding areas.
      G. Exhaust TB isolation room air to outside or, if absolutely unavoidable, recirculate
         after HEPA filtration.
 VII. Respiratory protection
      A. Respiratory protective devices should meet recommended performance criteria.
      B. Repiratory protection should be used by  persons entering rooms in which
         patients with known or suspected infectious TB are being isolated, by HCWs when
         performing cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures on such patients,
         and by persons in other settings where administrative and engineering controls
         are not likely to protect them from inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei.
      C. A respiratory protection program is required at all facilities in which respiratory
         protection is used.
VIII. Cough-inducing procedures
      A. Do not perform such procedures on TB patients unless absolutely necessary.
      B. Perform such procedures in areas that have local exhaust ventilation devices
         (e.g., booths or special enclosures) or, if this is not feasible, in a room that meets
         the ventilation requirements for TB isolation.
      C. After completion of procedures, TB patients should remain in the booth or special
         enclosure until their coughing subsides.
  IX. HCW TB training and education
      A. All HCWs should receive periodic TB education appropriate for their work respon-
         sibilities and duties.
      B. Training should include the epidemiology of TB in the facility.
      C.  TB  education  should  emphasize  concepts  of  the  pathogenesis  of  and
occupational
         risk for TB.
      D. Training should describe work practices that reduce the likelihood of transmitting
         M. tuberculosis.
   X. HCW counseling and screening
      A. Counsel all HCWs regarding TB and TB infection.
      B. Counsel all HCWs about the increased risk to immunocompromised persons for
         developing active TB.
      C. Perform PPD skin tests on HCWs at the beginning of their employment, and re-
         peat PPD tests at periodic intervals.
      D. Evaluate symptomatic HCWs for active TB.
  XI. Evaluate HCW PPD test conversions and possible nosocomial transmission of
      M. tuberculosis.
 XII. Coordinate efforts with public health department(s)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* A program such as this is appropriate for health-care facilities in which there is a high
risk
  for transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

TABLE S2-1. Summary of interpretation of purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin
skin-test results
====================================================
===========================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. An induration of >= 5 mm is classified as positive in:
   - persons who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or risk factors
     for HIV infection but unknown HIV status;
   - persons who have had recent close contact * with persons who have active tuber-
     culosis (TB);
   - persons who have fibrotic chest radiographs (consistent with healed TB).
2. An induration of >= 10 mm is classified as positive in all persons who do not meet
any of
   the criteria above but who have other risk factors for TB, including:
   High-risk groups --
   - injecting-drug users known to be HIV seronegative;
   - persons who have other medical conditions that reportedly increase the risk for
     progressing from latent TB infection to active TB (e.g., silicosis; gastrectomy or
     jejuno-ileal bypass; being >= 10% below ideal body weight; chronic renal failure
     with renal dialysis; diabetes mellitus; high-dose corticosteroid or other immuno-
     suppressive therapy; some hematologic disorders, including malignancies such
     as leukemias and lymphomas; and other malignancies);
   - children <4 years of age.
   High-prevalence groups --
   - persons born in countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America that
     have high prevalence of TB;
   - persons from medically underserved, low-income populations;
   - residents of long-term-care facilities (e.g., correctional institutions and nursing
     homes);
   - persons from high-risk populations in their communities, as determined by local
     public health authorities.
3. An induration of >= 15 mm is classified as positive in persons who do not meet any
of the
   above criteria.
4. Recent converters are defined on the basis of both size of induration and age of the
   person being tested:
   - >= 10 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for
     persons <35 years of age;
   - >= 15 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for
      persons >= 35 years of age.
5. PPD skin-test results in health-care workers (HCWs)
   - In general, the recommendations in sections 1, 2, and 3 of this table should be fol-
     lowed when interpreting skin-test results in HCWs.
     However, the prevalence of TB in the facility should be considered when choosing
     the appropriate cut-point for defining a positive PPD reaction. In facilities where
     there is essentially no risk for exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (i.e.,
     minimal- or very low-risk facilities ¦Section II.Bá), an induration >= 15 mm may be a
     suitable cut-point for HCWs who have no other risk factors. In facilities where TB
     patients receive care, the cut-point for HCWs with no other risk factors may be
     >= 10 mm.
   - A recent conversion in an HCW should be defined generally as a >= 10 mm increase
     in size of induration within a 2-year period. For HCWs who work in facilities
     where exposure to TB is very unlikely (e.g., minimal-risk facilities), an increase of
     >= 15 mm within a 2-year period may be more appropriate for defining a recent
con-
     version because of the lower positive-predictive value of the test in such groups.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Recent  close  contact  implies  either  household  or  social  contact  or  unprotected
occupational
  exposure similar in intensity and duration to household contact.

 + All regimens administered intermittently should be directly observed.
 &  For  infants  and  children  with  miliary  TB,  bone  and  joint  TB,  or  TB  meningitis,
treatment should last at least 12 months. For adults with these forms of

*  This  table  has  been  adapted  from  the  formula  for  the  rate  of  purging  airborne
contaminants
  (99). Values have been derived from the formula t(1) = ¦In (C(2) / C(1)) / (Q / V)á X 60,
  with T(1) = 0 and C(2) / C(1) - (removal efficiency / 100), and where:
                        t(1) = initial timepoint
                        C(1) = initial concentration of contaminant
                        C(2) = final concentration of contaminants

                       Q / V = ACH
  The times given assume perfect mixing of the air within the space (i.e., mixing factor
= 1).
  However,  perfect  mixing  usually  does  not  occur,  and  the  mixing  factor  could  be  as
high as 10
  if  air  distribution  is  very  poor  (98).  The  required  time  is  derived  by  multiplying  the
appropriate
  time from the table by the mixing factor that has been determined for the booth or
room. The
  factor and required time should be included in the operating instructions provided by
the
  manufacturer of the booth or enclosure, and these instructions should be followed.

   recirculation methods may be used. These methods are listed in order from the most
   desirable to the least desirable. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may be used as a
   supplement to any of the ventilation methods for air cleaning.

on the
   room's  configuration,  the  furniture  and  persons  in  the  room,  the  placement  of  the
unit, the
   supply and exhaust grilles, and the achievable ventilation rates and air mixing. Units
should
   be designed and operated to ensure that persons in the room cannot interfere with or
   otherwise  compromise  the  function  of  the  unit.  Fixed  recirculating  systems  are
preferred
   over portable units in TB isolation rooms of facilities in which services are provided
regularly

* Permissible exposure times are designed to prevent acute effects of irradiation to skin
and
  eyes (136). These recommended limits are wavelength dependent because different
wave-
  lengths of ultraviolet (UV) radiation have different adverse effects on these organs.
+ Relative spectral effectiveness (S sub 1) is used to compare various UV sources with
a source
  producing UV radiation at 270 nm, the wavelength of maximum ocular sensitivity. For
exam-
  ple,  the  relative  spectral  effectiveness  at  254  nm  is  0.5;  therefore,  twice  as  much
energy is
  required at 254 nm to produce an identical biologic effect at 270 nm. At 254 nm, the
NIOSH
  REL is 0.006 joules per square centimeter (J/cm2); and at 270 nm, it is 0.003 J/cm2.
For ger-
  micidal  lamps  that  emit  radiant  energy  predominantly  at  a  wavelength  of  254  nm,
proper use
  of the REL requires that the measured irradiance level (E) in microwatts per square
centimeter
  (uW/cm2) be multiplied by the relative spectral effectiveness at 254 nm (0.5) to obtain
Eeff. The
  maximum permissible exposure time can be calculated (in seconds) by dividing 0.003
J/cm2
  (the  NIOSH  REL  at  270  nm)  by  Eeff  in  uW/cm2  (136,150).  To  protect  health-care
workers who
  are  exposed  to  germicidal  UV  radiation  for  8  hours  per  work  day,  the  measured
irradiance (E)
  should be <=0.2 uW/cm2, which is calculated by obtaining Eeff (0.1 uW/cm2), then
dividing this
  value by S sub 1 (0.5).

 func-
tional unit (e.g., an internal medicine service) in which HCWs
 provide
services to and share air with a specific patient population or
 work with
clinical specimens that may contain viable M. tuberculosis
 organisms. The
risk for exposure to M. tuberculosis in a given area depends on the

lence of TB in the population served and the characteristics of the
 environ-
ment.  *** Cluster: two or more PPD skin-test conversions occurring within
 a 3-month
period among HCWs in a specific area or occupational group, and
 epidemiologic
evidence  suggests  occupational  (nosocomial)  transmission.   ****  Surgical  masks  are
designed to prevent the respiratory
 secretions of the
person wearing the mask from entering the air. When not in a TB
 isolation
room, patients suspected of having TB should wear surgical masks to
 reduce
the expulsion of droplet nuclei into the air. These patients do not
 need to
wear particulate respirators, which are designed to filter the air
 before it
is inhaled by the person wearing the mask. Patients suspected of
 having or
known to have TB should never wear a respirator that has an
 exhalation valve,
because the device would provide no barrier to the expulsion of
 droplet
nuclei  into  the  air.   *****  Some  filters  become  more  efficient  as  they  become  loaded
with
 dust.
Health-care settings do not have enough dust in the air to load a
 filter on
a respirator. Therefore, the filter efficiency for respirators used
 in
health-care settings must be determined in the unloaded state.  ****** Americans With

the terms used in the guidelines, as
 well as
others that are encountered frequently by persons who implement TB
 infection-
control programs. The definitions given are not dictionary
 definitions but
are those most applicable to usage relating to TB.  Acid-fast bacilli (AFB): Bacteria that
retain certain dyes after
 being washed  in an acid solution. Most acid-fast organisms are
 mycobacteria. When AFB
are seen on a stained smear of sputum or other clinical
 specimen, a
diagnosis of TB should be suspected; however, the diagnosis of
 TB is not
confirmed until a culture is grown and identified as M.
 tuberculosis.  Adherence: Refers to the behavior of patients when they follow all
 aspects of  the treatment regimen as prescribed by the medical provider,
 and also
refers to the behavior of HCWs and employers when they follow
 all
guidelines pertaining to infection control.  Aerosol: The droplet nuclei that are expelled
by an infectious
 person (e.g.,  by coughing or sneezing); these droplet nuclei can remain
 suspended in
the air and can transmit M. tuberculosis to other persons.  AIA: The American Institute
of Architects, a professional body that
 develops  standards for building ventilation.  Air changes: The ratio of the volume of air
flowing through a space
 in a  certain period of time (i.e., the airflow rate) to the volume
 of that
space (i.e., the room volume); this ratio is usually expressed
 as the
number of air changes per hour (ACH).  Air mixing: The degree to which air supplied to
a room mixes with
 the air  already in the room, usually expressed as a mixing factor.
 This factor
varies from 1 (for perfect mixing) to 10 (for poor mixing),
 and it is
used as a multiplier to determine the actual airflow required
 (i.e., the
recommended ACH multiplied by the mixing factor equals the
 actual ACH
required).  Alveoli: The small air sacs in the lungs that lie at the end of the
 bronchial  tree; the site where carbon dioxide in the blood is replaced
 by oxygen
from the lungs and where TB infection usually begins.  Anergy: The inability of a person
to react to skin-test antigens
 (even if the  person is infected with the organisms tested) because of
 immunosuppres-
sion.  Anteroom: A small room leading from a corridor into an isolation
 room; this  room can act as an airlock, preventing the escape of
 contaminants from
the  isolation  room  into  the  corridor.   Area:  A  structural  unit  (e.g.,  a  hospital  ward  or
laboratory) or
 functional  unit (e.g., an internal medicine service) in which HCWs
 provide services
to and share air with a specific patient population or work
 with
clinical specimens that may contain viable M. tuberculosis
 organisms.
The risk for exposure to M. tuberculosis in a given area
 depends on the
prevalence of TB in the population served and the
 characteristics of the
environment.  ASHRAE: The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and
 Air-Conditioning  Engineers, Inc., a professional body that develops standards
 for
building  ventilation.   Asymptomatic:  Without  symptoms,  or  producing  no  symptoms.  
Bacillus of Calmette and Gu,rin (BCG) vaccine: A TB vaccine used in
 many   parts  of  the  world.   BACTEC  (R):   One   of  the  most  often  used  radiometric
methods for
 detecting  the early growth of mycobacteria in culture. It provides rapid
 growth
(in 7-14 days) and rapid drug-susceptibility testing (in 5-6
 days). When
BACTEC (R) is used with rapid species identification methods,
 M. tuber-
culosis can be identified within 10-14 days of specimen
 collection.  Booster phenomenon: A phenomenon in which some persons (especially
 older  adults) who are skin tested many years after infection with M.
 tuber-
culosis have a negative reaction to an initial skin test,
 followed by a
positive reaction to a subsequent skin test. The second (i.e.,
 positive)
reaction is caused by a boosted immune response. Two-step
 testing is
used to distinguish new infections from boosted reactions (see
 Two-step
testing).  Bronchoscopy: A procedure for examining the respiratory tract that
 requires  inserting an instrument (a bronchoscope) through the mouth or
 nose and
into the trachea. The procedure can be used to obtain
 diagnostic
specimens.  Capreomycin: An injectable, second-line anti-TB drug used primarily
 for the  treatment of drug-resistant TB.  Cavity: A hole in the lung resulting from the
destruction of
 pulmonary tissue  by TB or other pulmonary infections or conditions. TB patients
 who have
cavities in their lungs are referred to as having cavitary
 disease, and
they are often more infectious than TB patients without
 cavitary
disease.  Chemotherapy: Treatment of an infection or disease by means of oral
 or  injectable drugs.  Cluster: Two or more PPD skin-test conversions occurring within a
 3-month  period among HCWs in a specific area or occupational group,
 and epidemi-
ologic evidence suggests occupational (nosocomial)
 transmission.  Contact: A person who has shared the same air with a person who has
 infec-  tious TB for a sufficient amount of time to allow possible
 transmission
of M. tuberculosis.  Conversion, PPD: See PPD test conversion.  Culture: The process of
growing bacteria in the laboratory so that
 organisms   can  be  identified.   Cycloserine:  A  second-line,  oral  anti-TB  drug  used
primarily for
 treating  drug-resistant TB.  Directly observed therapy (DOT): An adherence-enhancing
strategy in
 which an  HCW or other designated person watches the patient swallow
 each dose of
medication.  DNA probe: A technique that allows rapid and precise identification
 of myco-  bacteria (e.g., M. tuberculosis and M. bovis) that are grown
 in culture.
The  identification  can  often  be  completed  in  2  hours.   Droplet  nuclei:  Microscopic
particles (i.e., 1-5 mm in diameter)
 produced  when a person coughs, sneezes, shouts, or sings. The droplets
 produced
by an infectious TB patient can carry tubercle bacilli and can
 remain
suspended in the air for prolonged periods of time and be
 carried on
normal air currents in the room.  Drug resistance, acquired: A resistance to one or more
anti-TB
 drugs that  develops while a patient is receiving therapy and which
 usually results
from the patient's nonadherence to therapy or the prescription
 of an
inadequate regimen by a health-care provider.  Drug resistance, primary: A resistance
to one or more anti-TB drugs
 that  exists before a patient is treated with the drug(s). Primary
 resistance
occurs in persons exposed to and infected with a
 drug-resistant strain
of M. tuberculosis.  Drug-susceptibility pattern: The anti-TB drugs to which the
 tubercle bacilli  cultured from a TB patient are susceptible or resistant based
 on drug-
susceptibility tests.  Drug-susceptibility tests: Laboratory tests that determine whether
 the  tubercle bacilli cultured from a patient are susceptible or
 resistant to
various anti-TB drugs.  Ethambutol: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug sometimes used
 concomitantly with  INH, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.  Ethionamide: A second-line, oral
anti-TB drug used primarily for
 treating  drug-resistant TB.  Exposure: The condition of being subjected to something
(e.g.,
 infectious  agents) that could have a harmful effect. A person exposed to
 M. tuber-
culosis does not necessarily become infected (see
 Transmission).  First-line drugs: The most often used anti-TB drugs (i.e., INH,
 rifampin,   pyrazinamide,  ethambutol,  and  streptomycin).   Fixed  room-air  HEPA
recirculation systems: Nonmobile devices or
 systems that  remove airborne contaminants by recirculating air through a
 HEPA filter.
These may be built into the room and permanently ducted or may
 be
mounted to the wall or ceiling within the room. In either
 situation,
they are fixed in place and are not easily movable.  Fluorochrome stain: A technique for
staining a clinical specimen
 with  fluorescent dyes to perform a microscopic examination (smear)
 for myco-
bacteria. This technique is preferable to other staining
 techniques
because the mycobacteria can be seen easily and the slides can
 be read
quickly.  Fomites: Linens, books, dishes, or other objects used or touched by
 a  patient. These objects are not involved in the transmission of
 M. tuber-
culosis.  Gastric aspirate: A procedure sometimes used to obtain a specimen
 for culture  when a patient cannot cough up adequate sputum. A tube is
 inserted
through the mouth or nose and into the stomach to recover
 sputum that
was coughed into the throat and then swallowed. This procedure
 is
particularly useful for diagnosis in children, who are often
 unable to
cough up sputum.  High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter: A specialized filter
 that is  capable of removing 99.97% of particles 30.3 mm in diameter
 and that may
assist in controlling the transmission of M. tuberculosis.
 Filters may
be used in ventilation systems to remove particles from the
 air or in
personal respirators to filter air before it is inhaled by the
 person
wearing the respirator. The use of HEPA filters in ventilation
 systems
requires  expertise  in  installation  and  maintenance.   Human  immunodeficiency  virus
(HIV) infection: Infection with the
 virus that  causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV
 infection is the
most important risk factor for the progression of latent TB
 infection to
active TB.  Immunosuppressed: A condition in which the immune system is not
 functioning  normally (e.g., severe cellular immunosuppression resulting
 from HIV
infection or immunosuppressive therapy). Immunosuppressed
 persons are at
greatly increased risk for developing active TB after they
 have been
infected with M. tuberculosis. No data are available regarding
 whether
these persons are also at increased risk for infection with M.
 tuber-
culosis after they have been exposed to the organism.  Induration: An area of swelling
produced by an immune response to
 an antigen.  In tuberculin skin testing or anergy testing, the diameter of
 the
indurated area is measured 48-72 hours after the injection,
 and the
result is recorded in millimeters.  Infection: The condition in which organisms capable of
causing
 disease (e.g.,  M. tuberculosis) enter the body and elicit a response from the
 host' s
immune defenses. TB infection may or may not lead to clinical
 disease.  Infectious: Capable of transmitting infection. When persons who
 have  clinically active pulmonary or laryngeal TB disease cough or
 sneeze,
they can expel droplets containing M. tuberculosis into the
 air. Persons
whose sputum smears are positive for AFB are probably
 infectious.  Injectable: A medication that is usually administered by injection
 into the  muscle (intramuscular {IM}) or the bloodstream (intravenous
 {IV}).  Intermittent therapy: Therapy administered either two or three
 times per  week, rather than daily. Intermittent therapy should be
 administered
only under the direct supervision of an HCW or other
 designated person
(see  Directly  observed  therapy  {DOT}).   Intradermal:  Within  the  layers  of  the  skin.  
Isoniazid (INH): A first-line, oral drug used either alone as
 preventive  therapy or in combination with several other drugs to treat TB
 disease.  Kanamycin: An injectable, second-line anti-TB drug used primarily
 for  treat-   ment  of  drug-resistant  TB.   Latent  TB  infection:  Infection  with  M.
tuberculosis, usually
 detected by a  positive PPD skin-test result, in a person who has no symptoms
 of active
TB and who is not infectious.  Mantoux test: A method of skin testing that is performed
by
 injecting 0.1 mL  of PPD-tuberculin containing 5 tuberculin units into the
 dermis (i.e.,
the second layer of skin) of the forearm with a needle and
 syringe. This
test is the most reliable and standardized technique for
 tuberculin
testing (see Tuberculin skin test and Purified protein
 derivative {PPD}-
tuberculin test).  Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB): Active TB caused by M.
 tuber-  culosis organisms that are resistant to more than one anti-TB
 drug; in
practice, often refers to organisms that are resistant to both
 INH and
rifampin with or without resistance to other drugs (see Drug
 resistance,
acquired  and  Drug  resistance,  primary).   M.  tuberculosis  complex:  A  group  of  closely
related mycobacterial
 species  that can cause active TB (e.g., M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and
 M.
africanum); most TB in the United States is caused by M.
 tuberculosis.  Negative pressure: The relative air pressure difference between two
 areas in  a health-care facility. A room that is at negative pressure
 has a lower
pressure than adjacent areas, which keeps air from flowing out
 of the
room  and  into  adjacent  rooms  or  areas.   Nosocomial:  An  occurrence,  usually  an
infection, that is acquired
 in a  hospital or as a result of medical care.  Para-aminosalicylic acid: A second-line,
oral anti-TB drug used for
 treating  drug-resistant TB.  Pathogenesis: The pathologic, physiologic, or biochemical
process
 by which a  disease develops.  Pathogenicity: The quality of producing or the ability to
produce
 pathologic  changes or disease.  Some nontuberculous mycobacteria are
 pathogenic
(e.g., Mycobacterium kansasii), and others are not (e.g.,
 Mycobacterium
phlei).  Portable room-air HEPA recirculation units: Free-standing portable
 devices  that remove airborne contaminants by recirculating air through
 a HEPA
filter.  Positive PPD reaction: A reaction to the purified protein
 derivative (PPD)-  tuberculin skin test that suggests the person tested is
 infected with M.
tuberculosis. The person interpreting the skin-test reaction
 determines
whether it is positive on the basis of the size of the
 induration and
the medical history and risk factors of the person being
 tested.  Preventive therapy: Treatment of latent TB infection used to
 prevent the  progression of latent infection to clinically active disease.  Purified protein
derivative (PPD)-tuberculin: A purified tuberculin
 prepar-  ation that was developed in the 1930s and that was derived
 from old
tuberculin. The standard Mantoux test uses 0.1 mL of PPD
 standardized to
5 tuberculin units.  Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin test: A method used to
 evaluate  the likelihood that a person is infected with M. tuberculosis.
 A small
dose of tuberculin (PPD) is injected just beneath the surface
 of the
skin, and the area is examined 48-72 hours after the
 injection. A
reaction is measured according to the size of the induration.
 The
classification of a reaction as positive or negative depends
 on the
patient's medical history and various risk factors (see
 Mantoux test).  Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin test conversion: A
 change in PPD  test results  from negative to positive. A conversion within a
 2-year
period is usually interpreted as new M. tuberculosis
 infection, which
carries an increased risk for progression to active disease. A
 booster
reaction may be misinterpreted as a new infection (see Booster
phenomenon and Two-step testing).  Pyrazinamide: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug used in
treatment
 regimens.  Radiography: A method of viewing the respiratory system by using
 radiation to  transmit an image of the respiratory system to film. A chest
 radiograph
is taken to view the respiratory system of a person who is
 being
evaluated for pulmonary TB. Abnormalities (e.g., lesions or
 cavities in
the lungs and enlarged lymph nodes) may indicate the presence
 of TB.  Radiometric method: A method for culturing a specimen that allows
 for rapid  detection of bacterial growth by measuring production of CO2
 by viable
organisms; also a method of rapidly performing susceptibility
 testing of
M. tuberculosis.  Recirculation: Ventilation in which all or most of the air that is
 exhausted  from an area is returned to the same area or other areas of
 the
facility.  Regimen: Any particular TB treatment plan that specifies which
 drugs are  used, in what doses, according to what schedule, and for how
 long.  Registry: A record-keeping method for collecting clinical,
 laboratory, and  radiographic data concerning TB patients so that the data can
 be
organized and made available for epidemiologic study.  Resistance: The ability of some
strains of bacteria, including M.
 tuber-  culosis, to grow and multiply in the presence of certain drugs
 that
ordinarily kill them; such strains are referred to as
 drug-resistant
strains.  Rifampin: A first-line, oral anti-TB drug that, when used
 concomitantly with  INH and pyrazinamide, provides the basis for short-course
 therapy.  Room-air HEPA recirculation systems and units: Devices (either
 fixed or  portable) that remove airborne contaminants by recirculating
 air through
a HEPA filter.  Second-line drugs: Anti-TB drugs used when the first-line drugs
 cannot be  used (e.g., for drug-resistant TB or because of adverse
 reactions to the
first-line drugs). Examples are cycloserine, ethionamide, and
capreomycin.  Single-pass ventilation: Ventilation in which 100% of the air
 supplied  to  an   area  is  exhausted  to  the  outside.   Smear  (AFB  smear):  A  laboratory
technique for visualizing
 mycobacteria. The  specimen is smeared onto a slide and stained, then examined
 using a
microscope. Smear results should be available within 24 hours.
 In TB, a
large number of myco-bacteria seen on an AFB smear usually
 indicates
infectiousness. However, a positive result is not diagnostic
 of TB
because organisms other than M. tuberculosis may be seen on an
 AFB smear
(e.g., nontuberculous mycobacteria).  Source case: A case of TB in an infectious person
who has
 transmitted M.  tuberculosis to another person or persons.  Source control: Controlling
a contaminant at the source of its
 generation,  which prevents the spread of the contaminant to the general
 work space.  Specimen: Any body fluid, secretion, or tissue sent to a laboratory
 where  smears and cultures for M. tuberculosis will be performed
 (e.g., sputum,
urine, spinal fluid, and material obtained at biopsy).  Sputum: Phlegm coughed up from
deep within the lungs. If a patient
 has  pulmonary disease, an examination of the sputum by smear and
 culture can
be helpful in evaluating the organism responsible for the
 infection.
Sputum should not be confused with saliva or nasal secretions.
  Sputum induction: A method used to obtain sputum from a patient who
 is unable  to cough up a specimen spontaneously. The patient inhales a
 saline mist,
which stimulates a cough from deep within the lungs.  Sputum smear, positive: AFB are
visible on the sputum smear when
 viewed under  a microscope. Persons with a sputum smear positive for AFB are
considered more infectious than those with smear-negative
 sputum.   Streptomycin:  A  first-line,  injectable  anti-TB  drug.   Symptomatic:  Having
symptoms that may indicate the presence of TB
 or  another   disease  (see  Asymptomatic).   TB  case:  A  particular  episode  of  clinically
active TB. This term
 should be  used only to refer to the disease itself, not the patient with
 the
disease. By law, cases of TB must be reported to the local
 health
department.  TB infection: A condition in which living tubercle bacilli are
 present in the  body but the disease is not clinically active. Infected
 persons usually
have positive tuberculin reactions, but they have no symptoms
 related to
the infection and are not infectious. However, infected
 persons remain
at lifelong risk for developing disease unless preventive
 therapy is
given.  Transmission: The spread of an infectious agent from one person to
 another.  The likelihood of transmission is directly related to the
 duration and
intensity of exposure to M. tuberculosis (see Exposure).  Treatment failures: TB disease
in patients who do not respond to
 chemotherapy  and in patients whose disease worsens after having improved
 initially.  Tubercle bacilli: M. tuberculosis organisms.  Tuberculin skin test: A method
used to evaluate the likelihood that
 a person  is infected with M. tuberculosis. A small dose of
 PPD-tuberculin is
injected just beneath the surface of the skin, and the area is
 examined
48-72 hours after the injection. A reaction is measured
 according to the
size of the induration. The classification of a reaction as
 positive or
negative depends on the patient's medical history and various
 risk
factors (see Mantoux test, PPD test).  Tuberculosis (TB): A clinically active, symptomatic
disease caused
 by an  organism in the  M. tuberculosis complex (usually M.
 tuberculosis or,
rarely, M. bovis or M. africanum).  Two-step testing: A procedure used for the baseline
testing of
 persons who  will periodically receive tuberculin skin tests (e.g., HCWs)
 to reduce
the likelihood of mistaking a boosted reaction for a new
 infection. If
the initial tuberculin-test result is classified as negative,
 a second
test is repeated 1-3 weeks later. If the reaction to the
 second test is
positive, it probably represents a boosted reaction. If the
 second test
result is also negative, the person is classified as not
 infected. A
positive reaction to a subsequent test would indicate new
 infection
(i.e., a skin-test conversion) in such a person.  Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI):
The use of ultraviolet
 radiation  to kill or inactivate microorganisms.  Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI)
lamps: Lamps that kill or
  inactivate microorganisms by emitting ultraviolet germicidal
 radiation,
predominantly at a wavelength of 254 nm (intermediate light
 waves
between visible light and X-rays). UVGI lamps can be used in
 ceiling or
wall  fixtures  or  within  air  ducts  of  ventilation  systems.   Ventilation,  dilution:  An
engineering control technique to dilute
 and remove  airborne contaminants by the flow of air into and out of an
 area. Air
that contains droplet nuclei is removed and replaced by
 contaminant-free
air. If the flow is sufficient, droplet nuclei become
 dispersed, and
their concentration in the air is diminished.  Ventilation, local exhaust: Ventilation used
to capture and remove
 airborne  contaminants by enclosing the contaminant source (i.e., the
 patient) or
by placing an exhaust hood close to the contaminant source.  Virulence: The degree of
pathogenicity of a microorganism as
 indicated by the  severity of the disease produced and its ability to invade the
 tissues
of a host. M. tuberculosis is a virulent organism.

1. Review the community TB profile (from public health department data).
2. Review the number of TB patients who were treated in each area of the facility (both
   inpatient and outpatient). (This information can be obtained by analyzing laboratory
   surveillance data and by reviewing discharge diagnoses or medical and infection-
   control records.)
3. Review the drug-susceptibility patterns of TB isolates of patients who were treated at
   the facility.
4. Analyze purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin-test results of health-care
   workers (HCWs), by area or by occupational group for HCWs not assigned to a specific
   area (e.g., respiratory therapists).
5. To evaluate infection-control parameters, review medical records of a sample of TB
   patients seen at the facility.
   Calculate intervals from:
   - admission until TB suspected;
   - admission until TB evaluation performed;
   - admission until acid-fast bacilli (AFB) specimens ordered;
   - AFB specimens ordered until AFB specimens collected;
   - AFB specimens collected until AFB smears performed and reported;
   - AFB specimens collected until cultures performed and reported;
   - AFB specimens collected until species identification conducted and reported;
   - AFB specimens collected until drug-susceptibility tests performed and reported;
   - admission until TB isolation initiated;
   - admission until TB treatment initiated; and
   - duration of TB isolation.
   Obtain the following additional information:
   - Were appropriate criteria used for discontinuing isolation?
   - Did the patient have a history of prior admission to the facility?
   - Was the TB treatment regimen adequate?
   - Were follow-up sputum specimens collected properly?
   - Was appropriate discharge planning conducted?
6. Perform an observational review of TB infection control practices.
7. Review the most recent environmental evaluation and maintenance procedures.

  *  Because  very  low-risk  facilities  do  not  admit  patients  who  may  have  active  TB  to
inpatient areas, most HCWs in such facilities do
    not  need  routine  follow-up  PPD  screening  after  baseline  PPD  testing  is  done.
However, those who are involved in the initial
    assessment  and  diagnostic  evaluation  of  patients  in  the  ambulatory-care,
emergency, and admitting departments of such facilities
    or  in  the  outpatient  management  of  patients  with  active  TB  could  be  exposed
potentially to a patient who has active TB. These
    HCWs may need to receive routine periodic PPD screening. Similarly, these HCWs
may need to be included in a respiratory protection
    program.
  + Because very low-risk facilities do not admit patients suspected of having active TB,
review of TB patient medical records is not
    applicable.  However,  follow-up  of  patients  who  were  identified  during  triage  as
possibly having active TB and referred to another
    institution for further evaluation and management may be useful in evaluating the
effectiveness of the triage system.
  & Some minimal or very low-risk facilities may elect to use engineering controls (e.g.,
booths for cough-inducing procedures, portable
    high-efficiency  particulate  {HEPA}  filtration  units,  ultraviolet  germicidal  irradiation
units) in triage/waiting areas. In such situations,
    appropriate  protocols  for  maintaining  this  equipment  should  be  in  place,  and  this
maintenance should be evaluated periodically.
  @ The criteria used in clinical prediction rules will probably vary from facility to facility
depending on the prevalence of TB in the
    population  served  by  the  facility  and  on  the  clinical,  radiographic,  and  laboratory
characteristics of TB patients examined in the
    facility.
 **  The  protocols  should  be  consistent  with  CDC/American  Thoracic  Society
recommendations (33).
 ++  Protocols  for  referring  patients  who  require  specialized  treatment  (e.g.,  patients
with multidrug-resistant TB) may be appropriate.
 && Based on maximum daily number of patients requiring TB isolation for suspected or
confirmed active TB. Isolation rooms should
    meet the performance criteria specified in these guidelines.
 @@ If such procedures are used in the triage protocol(s) for identifying patients who
may have active TB.
*** Minimal-risk facilities do not need to maintain an ongoing PPD skin-testing program.
However, baseline PPD testing of HCWs may
    be  advisable  so  that  if  an  unexpected  exposure  does  occur,  conversions  can  be
distinguished from positive PPD test results caused
    by previous exposures.

TABLE 3. Characteristics of an effective tuberculosis (TB) infection-control program *
====================================================
=============================================
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I. Assignment of responsibility
      A. Assign responsibility for the TB infection-control program to qualified person(s).
      B. Ensure that persons with expertise in infection control, occupational health, and
         engineering are identified and included.
  II. Risk assessment, TB infection-control plan, and periodic reassessment
      A. Initial risk assessments
         1. Obtain information concerning TB in the community.
         2. Evaluate data concerning TB patients in the facility.
         3. Evaluate data concerning purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin skin-test
            conversions among health-care workers (HCWs) in the facility.
         4. Rule out evidence of person-to-person transmission.
      B. Written TB infection-control program
         1. Select initial risk protocol(s).
         2. Develop written TB infection-control protocols.
      C. Repeat risk assessment at appropriate intervals.
         1. Review current community and facility surveillance data and PPD-tuberculin
            skin-test results.
         2. Review records of TB patients.
         3. Observe HCW infection-control practices.
         4. Evaluate maintenance of engineering controls.
 III. Identification, evaluation, and treatment of patients who have TB
      A. Screen patients for signs and symptoms of active TB:
         1. On initial encounter in emergency department or ambulatory-care setting.
         2. Before or at the time of admission.
      B. Perform radiologic and bacteriologic evaluation of patients who have signs and
         symptoms suggestive of TB.
      C. Promptly initiate treatment.
  IV. Managing outpatients who have possible infectious TB
      A. Promptly initiate TB precautions.
      B. Place patients in separate waiting areas or TB isolation rooms.
      C. Give patients a surgical mask, a box of tissues, and instructions regarding the
use
         of these items.
   V. Managing inpatients who have possible infectious TB
      A. Promptly isolate patients who have suspected or known infectious TB.
      B. Monitor the response to treatment.
      C. Follow appropriate criteria for discontinuing isolation.
  VI. Engineering recommendations
      A. Design local exhaust and general ventilation in collaboration with persons who
         have expertise in ventilation engineering.
      B. Use a single-pass air system or air recirculation after high-efficiency particulate
air
         (HEPA) filtration in areas where infectious TB patients receive care.
      C. Use additional measures, if needed, in areas where TB patients may receive care.
      D. Design TB isolation rooms in health-care facilities to achieve greater than or
         equal to 6 air changes per hour (ACH) for existing facilities and greater than
         or equal to 12 ACH for new or renovated facilities.
      E. Regularly monitor and maintain engineering controls.
      F. TB isolation rooms that are being used should be monitored daily to ensure they
         maintain negative pressure relative to the hallway and all surrounding areas.
      G. Exhaust TB isolation room air to outside or, if absolutely unavoidable, recirculate
         after HEPA filtration.
 VII. Respiratory protection
      A. Respiratory protective devices should meet recommended performance criteria.
      B. Repiratory protection should be used by  persons entering rooms in which
         patients with known or suspected infectious TB are being isolated, by HCWs when
         performing cough-inducing or aerosol-generating procedures on such patients,
         and by persons in other settings where administrative and engineering controls
         are not likely to protect them from inhaling infectious airborne droplet nuclei.
      C. A respiratory protection program is required at all facilities in which respiratory
         protection is used.
VIII. Cough-inducing procedures
      A. Do not perform such procedures on TB patients unless absolutely necessary.
      B. Perform such procedures in areas that have local exhaust ventilation devices
         (e.g., booths or special enclosures) or, if this is not feasible, in a room that meets
         the ventilation requirements for TB isolation.
      C. After completion of procedures, TB patients should remain in the booth or special
         enclosure until their coughing subsides.
  IX. HCW TB training and education
      A. All HCWs should receive periodic TB education appropriate for their work respon-
         sibilities and duties.
      B. Training should include the epidemiology of TB in the facility.
      C.  TB  education  should  emphasize  concepts  of  the  pathogenesis  of  and
occupational
         risk for TB.
      D. Training should describe work practices that reduce the likelihood of transmitting
         M. tuberculosis.
   X. HCW counseling and screening
      A. Counsel all HCWs regarding TB and TB infection.
      B. Counsel all HCWs about the increased risk to immunocompromised persons for

TABLE S2-1. Summary of interpretation of purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin
skin-test results
====================================================
===========================================
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. An induration of >= 5 mm is classified as positive in:
   - persons who have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or risk factors
     for HIV infection but unknown HIV status;
   - persons who have had recent close contact * with persons who have active tuber-
     culosis (TB);
   - persons who have fibrotic chest radiographs (consistent with healed TB).
2. An induration of >= 10 mm is classified as positive in all persons who do not meet
any of
   the criteria above but who have other risk factors for TB, including:
   High-risk groups --
   - injecting-drug users known to be HIV seronegative;
   - persons who have other medical conditions that reportedly increase the risk for
     progressing from latent TB infection to active TB (e.g., silicosis; gastrectomy or
     jejuno-ileal bypass; being >= 10% below ideal body weight; chronic renal failure
     with renal dialysis; diabetes mellitus; high-dose corticosteroid or other immuno-
     suppressive therapy; some hematologic disorders, including malignancies such
     as leukemias and lymphomas; and other malignancies);
   - children <4 years of age.
   High-prevalence groups --
   - persons born in countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America that
     have high prevalence of TB;
   - persons from medically underserved, low-income populations;
   - residents of long-term-care facilities (e.g., correctional institutions and nursing
     homes);
   - persons from high-risk populations in their communities, as determined by local
     public health authorities.
3. An induration of >= 15 mm is classified as positive in persons who do not meet any
of the
   above criteria.
4. Recent converters are defined on the basis of both size of induration and age of the
   person being tested:
   - >= 10 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for
     persons <35 years of age;
   - >= 15 mm increase within a 2-year period is classified as a recent conversion for
      persons >= 35 years of age.
5. PPD skin-test results in health-care workers (HCWs)
   - In general, the recommendations in sections 1, 2, and 3 of this table should be fol-
     lowed when interpreting skin-test results in HCWs.
     However, the prevalence of TB in the facility should be considered when choosing
     the appropriate cut-point for defining a positive PPD reaction. In facilities where
     there is essentially no risk for exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (i.e.,
     minimal- or very low-risk facilities ¦Section II.Bá), an induration >= 15 mm may be a
     suitable cut-point for HCWs who have no other risk factors. In facilities where TB
     patients receive care, the cut-point for HCWs with no other risk factors may be
     >= 10 mm.
   - A recent conversion in an HCW should be defined generally as a >= 10 mm increase
     in size of induration within a 2-year period. For HCWs who work in facilities
     where exposure to TB is very unlikely (e.g., minimal-risk facilities), an increase of
     >= 15 mm within a 2-year period may be more appropriate for defining a recent
con-
     version because of the lower positive-predictive value of the test in such groups.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Recent  close  contact  implies  either  household  or  social  contact  or  unprotected
occupational
  exposure similar in intensity and duration to household contact.

 + All regimens administered intermittently should be directly observed.
 &  For  infants  and  children  with  miliary  TB,  bone  and  joint  TB,  or  TB  meningitis,
treatment should last at least 12 months. For adults with these forms of
   extrapulmonary TB, response to therapy should be monitored closely. If response is
slow or suboptimal, treatment may be prolonged on a case-by-case
   basis.
 @ Some evidence suggests that SM may be discontinued after 4 months if the isolate
is susceptible to all drugs.
**  Avoid  treating  pregnant  women  with  SM  because  of  the  risk  for  ototoxicity  to  the
fetus.
Note:  For  all  patients,  if  drug-susceptibility  results  show  resistance  to  any  of  the
first-line drugs, or if the patient remains symptomatic or smear- or
culture-positive after 3 months, consult a TB medical expert.

*  This  table  has  been  adapted  from  the  formula  for  the  rate  of  purging  airborne
contaminants
  (99). Values have been derived from the formula t(1) = ¦In (C(2) / C(1)) / (Q / V)á X 60,
  with T(1) = 0 and C(2) / C(1) - (removal efficiency / 100), and where:
                        t(1) = initial timepoint
                        C(1) = initial concentration of contaminant
                        C(2) = final concentration of contaminants
                           Q = air flow rate (cubic feet per hour)
                           V = room volume (cubic feet)
                       Q / V = ACH
  The times given assume perfect mixing of the air within the space (i.e., mixing factor
= 1).
  However,  perfect  mixing  usually  does  not  occur,  and  the  mixing  factor  could  be  as
high as 10
  if  air  distribution  is  very  poor  (98).  The  required  time  is  derived  by  multiplying  the
appropriate
  time from the table by the mixing factor that has been determined for the booth or
room. The
  factor and required time should be included in the operating instructions provided by
the
  manufacturer of the booth or enclosure, and these instructions should be followed.

 * Ventilation methods are used to reduce the concentration of airborne tubercle bacilli.
If the
   facility  HVAC  system  cannot  achieve  the  recommended  ventilation  rate,  auxiliary
room-air
   recirculation methods may be used. These methods are listed in order from the most
   desirable to the least desirable. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation may be used as a
   supplement to any of the ventilation methods for air cleaning.
 + Directional airflow using negative pressure can be achieved with the facility HVAC
system
   and/or the auxiliary air-recirculation--cleaning systems. These methods are listed in
order
   from the most desirable to the least desirable.
 & To remove the amount of return air necessary to achieve negative pressure.
 @ The effectiveness of portable room-air HEPA recirculation units can vary depending
on the
   room's  configuration,  the  furniture  and  persons  in  the  room,  the  placement  of  the
unit, the
   supply and exhaust grilles, and the achievable ventilation rates and air mixing. Units
should
   be designed and operated to ensure that persons in the room cannot interfere with or
   otherwise  compromise  the  function  of  the  unit.  Fixed  recirculating  systems  are
preferred
   over portable units in TB isolation rooms of facilities in which services are provided
regularly
   to TB patients.
**  This  method  simply  achieves  negative  pressure  and  should  be  used  only  as  a
temporary
   measure.

* Permissible exposure times are designed to prevent acute effects of irradiation to skin
and
  eyes (136). These recommended limits are wavelength dependent because different
wave-
  lengths of ultraviolet (UV) radiation have different adverse effects on these organs.
+ Relative spectral effectiveness (S sub 1) is used to compare various UV sources with
a source
  producing UV radiation at 270 nm, the wavelength of maximum ocular sensitivity. For
exam-
  ple,  the  relative  spectral  effectiveness  at  254  nm  is  0.5;  therefore,  twice  as  much
energy is
  required at 254 nm to produce an identical biologic effect at 270 nm. At 254 nm, the
NIOSH
  REL is 0.006 joules per square centimeter (J/cm2); and at 270 nm, it is 0.003 J/cm2.
For ger-
  micidal  lamps  that  emit  radiant  energy  predominantly  at  a  wavelength  of  254  nm,
proper use
  of the REL requires that the measured irradiance level (E) in microwatts per square
centimeter
  (uW/cm2) be multiplied by the relative spectral effectiveness at 254 nm (0.5) to obtain
Eeff. The
  maximum permissible exposure time can be calculated (in seconds) by dividing 0.003
J/cm2
  (the  NIOSH  REL  at  270  nm)  by  Eeff  in  uW/cm2  (136,150).  To  protect  health-care
workers who
  are  exposed  to  germicidal  UV  radiation  for  8  hours  per  work  day,  the  measured
irradiance (E)
  should be <=0.2 uW/cm2, which is calculated by obtaining Eeff (0.1 uW/cm2), then
dividing this
  value by S sub 1 (0.5).
