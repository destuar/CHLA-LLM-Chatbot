transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings. Healthcare organizations can
demonstrate  a  commitment  to  preventing  transmission  of  infectious  agents  by
incorporating  infection  control  into  the  objectives  of  the  organization's  patient  and
occupational safety programs.543-547 An infrastructure to guide, support, and monitor
adherence to Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions 434, 548, 549 will facilitate
fulfillment  of  the  organization's  mission  and  achievement  of  the  Joint  Commission  on
Accreditation  of  Healthcare  Organization's  patient  safety  goal  to  decrease  HAIs.550
Policies and procedures that explain how Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions
are  applied,  including  systems  used  to  identify  and  communicate  information  about
patients  with  potentially  transmissible  infectious  agents,  are  essential  to  ensure  the
success  of  these  measures  and  may  vary  according  to  the  characteristics  of  the
organization. A key administrative measure is provision of fiscal and human resources
for maintaining infection control and occupational health programs that are responsive
to  emerging  needs.  Specific  components  include  bedside  nurse  551  and  infection
prevention and control professional (ICP) staffing levels,552 inclusion of ICPs in facility
construction and design decisions,11 clinical microbiology laboratory support,553, 554
adequate  supplies  and  equipment  including  facility  ventilation  systems,11  adherence
monitoring,555  assessment  and  correction  of  system  failures  that  contribute  to
transmission,556,  557  and  provision  of  feedback  to  healthcare  personnel  and  senior
administrators.434, 548, 549, 558 The positive influence of institutional leadership has
been  demonstrated  repeatedly  in  studies  of  HCW  adherence  to  recommended  hand
hygiene  practices.176,  177,  434,  548,  549,  559-564  Healthcare  administrator
involvement  in  infection  control  processes  can  improve  administrators'  awareness  of
the  rationale  and  resource  requirements  for  following  recommended  infection  control
practices.  Several  administrative  factors  may  affect  the  transmission  of  infectious
agents in healthcare settings: institutional culture, individual worker behavior, and the
work  environment.  Each  of  these  areas  is  suitable  for  performance  improvement
monitoring and incorporation into the organization's patient safety goals.543, 544, 546,
565  The  effectiveness  of  infection  surveillance  and  control  programs  in  preventing
nosocomial infections in United States hospitals was assessed by the CDC through the
Study  on  the  Efficacy  of  Nosocomial  Infection  Control  (SENIC  Project)  conducted
1970-76.566 In a representative sample of US general hospitals, those with a trained
infection  control  physician  or  microbiologist  involved  in  an  infection  control  program,
and at least one infection control nurse per 250 beds, were associated with a 32% lower
rate
 of
 four
 infections
 studied
 (CVC-associated
 bloodstream
 infections,
ventilator-associated pneumonias, catheter-related urinary tract infections, and surgical
site infections). Since that landmark study was published, responsibilities of ICPs have
expanded  commensurate  with  the  growing  complexity  of  the  healthcare  system,  the
patient  populations  served,  and  the  increasing  numbers  of  medical  procedures  and
devices  used  in  all  types  of  healthcare  settings.  The  scope  of  work  of  ICPs  was  first
assessed in 1982 567-569 by the Certification Board of Infection Control (CBIC), and has
been re-assessed every five years since that time.558, 570-572 The findings of these
task analyses have been used to develop and update the Infection Control Certification
Examination, offered for the first time in 1983. With each survey, it is apparent that the
role of the ICP is growing in complexity and scope, beyond traditional infection control
activities  in  acute  care  hospitals.  Activities  currently  assigned  to  ICPs  in  response  to
emerging challenges include: None of the CBIC job analyses addressed specific staffing
requirements  for  the  identified  tasks,  although  the  surveys  did  include  information
about  hours  worked;  the  2001  survey  included  the  number  of  ICPs  assigned  to  the
responding facilities.558 There is agreement in the literature that 1 ICP per 250 acute
care  beds  is  no  longer  adequate  to  meet  current  infection  control  needs;  a  Delphi
project that assessed staffing needs of infection control programs in the 21st century
concluded  that  a  ratio  of  0.8  to  1.0  ICP  per  100  occupied  acute  care  beds  is  an
appropriate  level  of  staffing.552  A  survey  of  participants  in  the  National  Nosocomial
Infections  Surveillance  (NNIS)  system  found  the  average  daily  census  per  ICP  was
115.316 Results of other studies have been similar: 3 per 500 beds for large acute care
hospitals,  1  per  150-250  beds  in  long  term  care  facilities,  and  1.56  per  250  in  small
rural hospitals.573, 575 The foregoing demonstrates that infection control staffing can
no  longer  be  based  on  patient  census  alone,  but  rather  must  be  determined  by  the
scope  of  the  program,  characteristics  of  the  patient  population,  complexity  of  the
healthcare system, tools available to assist personnel to perform essential tasks (e.g.,
electronic tracking and laboratory support for surveillance), and unique or urgent needs
of the institution and community.552 Furthermore, appropriate training is required to
optimize  the  quality  of  work  performed.558,  572,  576  II.A.1.A.I.  INFECTION  CONTROL
NURSE  LIAISON.  Designating  a  bedside  nurse  on  a  patient  care  unit  as  an  infection
control liaison or "link nurse" is reported to be an effective adjunct to enhance infection
control  at  the  unit  level.577-582  Such  individuals  receive  training  in  basic  infection
control and have frequent communication with the ICPs, but maintain their primary role
as  bedside  caregiver  on  their  units.  The  infection  control  nurse  liaison  increases  the
awareness  of  infection  control  at  the  unit  level.  He  or  she  is  especially  effective  in
implementation  of  new  policies  or  control  interventions  because  of  the  rapport  with
individuals  on  the  unit,  an  understanding  of  unit-specific  challenges,  and  ability  to
promote strategies that are most likely to be successful in that unit. This position is an
adjunct to, not a replacement for, fully trained ICPs. Furthermore, the infection control
liaison nurses should not be counted when considering ICP staffing. There is increasing
evidence  that  the  level  of  bedside  nurse-staffing  influences  the  quality  of  patient
care.583, 584 If there are adequate nursing staff, it is more likely that infection control
practices,  including  hand  hygiene  and  Standard  and  Transmission-Based  Precautions,
will  be  given  appropriate  attention  and  applied  correctly  and  consistently.552  A
national  multicenter  study  reported  strong  and  consistent  inverse  relationships
between  nurse  staffing  and  five  adverse  outcomes  in  medical  patients,  two  of  which
were HAIs: urinary tract infections and pneumonia.583 The association of nursing staff
shortages with increased rates of HAIs has been demonstrated in several outbreaks in
hospitals  and  long  term  care  settings,  and  with  increased  transmission  of  hepatitis  C
virus in dialysis units.22, 418, 551, 585-597 In most cases, when staffing improved as
part  of  a  comprehensive  control  intervention,  the  outbreak  ended  or  the  HAI  rate
declined. In two studies,590, 596 the composition of the nursing staff ("pool" or "float"
vs. regular staff nurses) influenced the rate of primary bloodstream infections, with an
increased infection rate occurring when the proportion of regular nurses decreased and
pool  nurses  increased.  The  critical  role  of  the  clinical  microbiology  laboratory  in
infection control and healthcare epidemiology is described well 553, 554, 598-600 and
is  supported  by  the  Infectious  Disease  Society  of  America  policy  statement  on
consolidation  of  clinical  microbiology  laboratories  published  in  2001.553  The  clinical
microbiology laboratory contributes to preventing transmission of infectious diseases in
healthcare  settings  by  promptly  detecting  and  reporting  epidemiologically  important
organisms,  identifying  emerging  patterns  of  antimicrobial  resistance,  and  assisting  in
assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  recommended  precautions  to  limit  transmission
during
 outbreaks.598
 Outbreaks

 by
laboratorians.162  Healthcare  organizations  need  to  ensure  the  availability  of  the
recommended  scope  and  quality  of  laboratory  services,  a  sufficient  number  of
appropriately trained laboratory staff members, and systems to promptly communicate
epidemiologically  important  results  to  those  who  will  take  action  (e.g.,  providers  of
clinical care, infection control staff, healthcare epidemiologists, and infectious disease
consultants).601  As  concerns  about  emerging  pathogens  and  bioterrorism  grow,  the
role  of  the  clinical  microbiology  laboratory  takes  on  even  greater  importance.  For
healthcare  organizations  that  outsource  microbiology  laboratory  services  (e.g.,
ambulatory  care,  home  care,  LTCFs,  smaller  acute  care  hospitals),  it  is  important  to
specify  by  contract  the  types  of  services  (e.g.,  periodic  institution-specific  aggregate
susceptibility reports) required to support infection control. Several key functions of the
clinical microbiology laboratory are relevant to this guideline: Safety culture (or safety
climate)  refers  to  a  work  environment  where  a  shared  commitment  to  safety  on  the
part of management and the workforce is understood and followed.557, 620, 621 The
authors  of  the  Institute  of  Medicine  Report,  To  Err  is  Human,543  acknowledge  that
causes of medical error are multifaceted but emphasize repeatedly the pivotal role of
system failures and the benefits of a safety culture. A safety culture is created through
Safety and patient outcomes can be enhanced by improving or creating organizational
characteristics  within  patient  care  units  as  demonstrated  by  studies  of  surgical
ICUs.622, 623 Each of these factors has a direct bearing on adherence to transmission
prevention  recommendations.257  Measurement  of  an  institutional  culture  of  safety  is
useful  for  designing  improvements  in  healthcare.624,  625  Several  hospital-based
studies have linked measures of safety culture with both employee adherence to safe
practices and reduced exposures to blood and body fluids.626-632 One study of hand
hygiene practices concluded that improved adherence requires integration of infection
control into the organization's safety culture.561 Several hospitals that are part of the
Veterans Administration Healthcare System have taken specific steps toward improving
the  safety  culture,  including  error  reporting  mechanisms,  performing  root  cause
analysis
 on
 problems
 identified,
 providing
 safety
 incentives,
 and
 employee
education.633-635  Adherence  to  recommended  infection  control  practices  decreases
transmission  of  infectious  agents  in  healthcare  settings.116,  562,  636-640  However,
several observational studies have shown limited adherence to recommended practices
by  healthcare  personnel.559,  640-657  Observed  adherence  to  universal  precautions
ranged from 43% to 89%.641, 642, 649, 651, 652 However, the degree of adherence
depended  frequently  on  the  practice  that  was  assessed  and,  for  glove  use,  the
circumstance in which they were used. Appropriate glove use has ranged from a low of
15% 645 to a high of 82%.650 However, 92% and 98% adherence with glove use have
been  reported  during  arterial  blood  gas  collection  and  resuscitation,  respectively,
procedures  where  there  may  be  considerable  blood  contact.643,  656  Differences  in
observed  adherence  have  been  reported  among  occupational  groups  in  the  same
healthcare facility 641 and between experienced and nonexperienced professionals.645
In surveys of healthcare personnel, self-reported adherence was generally higher than
that reported in observational studies. Furthermore, where an observational component
was  included  with  a  self-reported  survey,  self-perceived  adherence  was  often  greater
than  observed  adherence.657  Among  nurses  and  physicians,  increasing  years  of
experience  is  a  negative  predictor  of  adherence.645,  651  Education  to  improve
adherence is the primary intervention that has been studied. While positive changes in
knowledge and attitude have been demonstrated,640, 658 there often has been limited
or no accompanying change in behavior.642, 644 Self-reported adherence is higher in
groups  that  have  received  an  educational  intervention.630,  659  Educational
interventions that incorporated videotaping and performance feedback were successful
in  improving  adherence  during  the  period  of  study;  the  long-term  effect  of  these
interventions  is  not  known.654  The  use  of  videotape  also  served  to  identify  system
problems  (e.g.,  communication  and  access  to  personal  protective  equipment)  that
otherwise  may  not  have  been  recognized.  Use  of  engineering  controls  and  facility
design  concepts  for  improving  adherence  is  gaining  interest.  While  introduction  of
automated sinks had a negative impact on consistent adherence to hand washing,660
use  of  electronic  monitoring  and  voice  prompts  to  remind  healthcare  workers  to
perform hand hygiene, and improving accessibility to hand hygiene products, increased
adherence and contributed to a decrease in HAIs in one study.661 More information is
needed regarding how technology might improve adherence. Improving adherence to
infection  control  practices  requires  a  multifaceted  approach  that  incorporates
continuous assessment of both the individual and the work environment.559, 561 Using
several  behavioral  theories,  Kretzer  and  Larson  concluded  that  a  single  intervention
(e.g.,  a  handwashing  campaign  or  putting  up  new  posters  about  transmission
precautions)
 would
 likely
 be
 ineffective
 in
 improving
 healthcare
 personnel
adherence.662  Improvement  requires  that  the  organizational  leadership  make
prevention  an  institutional  priority  and  integrate  infection  control  practices  into  the
organization's  safety  culture.561  A  recent  review  of  the  literature  concluded  that
variations  in  organizational  factors  (e.g.,  safety  climate,  policies  and  procedures,
education and training) and individual factors (e.g., knowledge, perceptions of risk, past
experience)  were  determinants  of  adherence  to  infection  control  guidelines  for
protection  against  SARS  and  other  respiratory  pathogens.257  Surveillance  is  an
essential tool for case-finding of single patients or clusters of patients who are infected
or colonized with epidemiologically important organisms (e.g., susceptible bacteria such
as  S.  aureus,  S.  pyogenes  [Group  A  streptococcus]  or  Enterobacter-Klebsiella  spp;
MRSA,  VRE,  and  other  MDROs;  C.  difficile;  RSV;  influenza  virus)  for  which
transmission-based  precautions  may  be  required.  Surveillance  is  defined  as  the
ongoing,  systematic  collection,  analysis,  interpretation,  and  dissemination  of  data
regarding a health-related event for use in public health action to reduce morbidity and
mortality and to improve health.663 The work of Ignaz Semmelweis that described the
role of person-to-person transmission in puerperal sepsis is the earliest example of the
use of surveillance data to reduce transmission of infectious agents.664 Surveillance of
both process measures and the infection rates to which they are linked are important
for  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  infection  prevention  efforts  and  identifying
indications for change.555, 665-668 The Study on the Efficacy of Nosocomial Infection
Control (SENIC) found that different combinations of infection control practices resulted
in  reduced  rates  of  nosocomial  surgical  site  infections,  pneumonia,  urinary  tract
infections,  and  bacteremia  in  acute  care  hospitals;566  however,  surveillance  was  the
only component essential for reducing all four types of HAIs. Although a similar study
has  not  been  conducted  in  other  healthcare  settings,  a  role  for  surveillance  and  the
need for novel strategies have been described in LTCFs 398, 434, 669, 670 and in home
care.470-473  The  essential  elements  of  a  surveillance  system  are:  Data  gathered
through  surveillance  of  high-risk  populations,  device  use,  procedures,  and/or  facility
locations (e.g., ICUs) are useful for detecting transmission trends.671-673 Identification
of clusters of infections should be followed by a systematic epidemiologic investigation
to determine commonalities in persons, places, and time; and guide implementation of
interventions  and  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  those  interventions.  Targeted
surveillance  based  on  the  highest  risk  areas  or  patients  has  been  preferred  over
facility-wide  surveillance  for  the  most  effective  use  of  resources.673,  676  However,
surveillance  for  certain  epidemiologically  important  organisms  may  need  to  be
facility-wide.  Surveillance  methods  will  continue  to  evolve  as  healthcare  delivery
systems  change  392,  677  and  user-friendly  electronic  tools  become  more  widely
available  for  electronic  tracking  and  trend  analysis.674,  678,  679  Individuals  with
experience  in  healthcare  epidemiology  and  infection  control  should  be  involved  in
selecting software packages for data aggregation and analysis to assure that the need
for  efficient  and  accurate  HAI  surveillance  will  be  met.  Effective  surveillance  is
increasingly  important  as  legislation  requiring  public  reporting  of  HAI  rates  is  passed
and states work to develop effective systems to support such legislation.680 Education
and  training  of  healthcare  personnel  are  a  prerequisite  for  ensuring  that  policies  and
procedures  for  Standard  and  Transmission-Based  Precautions  are  understood  and
practiced. Understanding the scientific rationale for the precautions will allow HCWs to
apply  procedures  correctly,  as  well  as  safely  modify  precautions  based  on  changing
requirements,  resources,  or  healthcare  settings.14,  655,  681-688  In  one  study,  the
likelihood of HCWs developing SARS was strongly associated with less than 2 hours of
infection control training and lack of understanding of infection control procedures.689
Education  about  the  important  role  of  vaccines  (e.g.,  influenza,  measles,  varicella,
pertussis, pneumococcal) in protecting healthcare personnel, their patients, and family
members can help improve vaccination rates.690-693 Education on the principles and
practices for preventing transmission of infectious agents should begin during training
in the health professions and be provided to anyone who has an opportunity for contact
with  patients  or  medical  equipment  (e.g.,  nursing  and  medical  staff;  therapists  and
technicians,  including  respiratory,  physical,  occupational,  radiology,  and  cardiology
personnel;  phlebotomists;  housekeeping  and  maintenance  staff;  and  students).  In
healthcare  facilities,  education  and  training  on  Standard  and  Transmission-Based
Precautions are typically provided at the time of orientation and should be repeated as
necessary  to  maintain  competency;  updated  education  and  training  are  necessary
when policies and procedures are revised or when there is a special circumstance, such
as  an  outbreak  that  requires  modification  of  current  practice  or  adoption  of  new
recommendations.  Education  and  training  materials  and  methods  appropriate  to  the
HCW's  level  of  responsibility,  individual  learning  habits,  and  language  needs,  can
improve  the  learning  experience.658,  694-702  Education  programs  for  healthcare
personnel  have  been  associated  with  sustained  improvement  in  adherence  to  best
practices  and  a  related  decrease  in  device-associated  HAIs  in  teaching  and
non-teaching settings 639, 703 and in medical and surgical ICUs {Coopersmith, 2002
#2149; Babcock, 2004 #2126; Berenholtz, 2004 #2289; [This link is no longer active:
www.ihi.org/IHI/Programs/Campaign],  #2563}  Several  studies  have  shown  that,  in
addition to targeted education to improve specific practices, periodic assessment and
feedback  of  the  HCWs  knowledge,and  adherence  to  recommended  practices  are
necessary  to  achieve  the  desired  changes  and  to  identify  continuing  education
needs.562,  704-708  Effectiveness  of  this  approach  for  isolation  practices  has  been
demonstrated for control of RSV.116, 684 Patients, family members, and visitors can be
partners in preventing transmission of infections in healthcare settings.9, 42, 709-711
Information  about  Standard  Precautions,  especially  hand  hygiene,  Respiratory
Hygiene/Cough  Etiquette,  vaccination  (especially  against  influenza)  and  other  routine
infection prevention strategies may be incorporated into patient information materials
that  are  provided  upon  admission  to  the  healthcare  facility.  Additional  information
about Transmission-Based Precautions is best provided at the time they are initiated.
Fact  sheets,  pamphlets,  and  other  printed  material  may  include  information  on  the
rationale for the additional precautions, risks to household members, room assignment
for  Transmission-Based  Precautions  purposes,  explanation  about  the  use  of  personal
protective  equipment  by  HCWs,  and  directions  for  use  of  such  equipment  by  family
members  and  visitors.  Such  information  may  be  particularly  helpful  in  the  home
environment  where  household  members  often  have  primary  responsibility  for
adherence to recommended infection control practices. Healthcare personnel must be
available and prepared to explain this material and answer questions as needed. Hand
hygiene has been cited frequently as the single most important practice to reduce the
transmission  of  infectious  agents  in  healthcare  settings  559,  712,  713  and  is  an
essential  element  of  Standard  Precautions.  The  term  "hand  hygiene"  includes  both
handwashing  with  either  plain  or  antiseptic-containing  soap  and  water,  and  use  of
alcohol-based products (gels, rinses, foams) that do not require the use of water. In the
absence  of  visible  soiling  of  hands,  approved  alcohol-based  products  for  hand
disinfection are preferred over antimicrobial or plain soap and water because of their
superior  microbiocidal  activity,  reduced  drying  of  the  skin,  and  convenience.559
Improved  hand  hygiene  practices  have  been  associated  with  a  sustained  decrease  in
the incidence of MRSA and VRE infections primarily in the ICU.561, 562, 714-717 The
scientific  rationale,  indications,  methods,  and  products  for  hand  hygiene  are
summarized in other publications.559, 717 The effectiveness of hand hygiene can be
reduced  by  the  type  and  length  of  fingernails.559,  718,  719  Individuals  wearing
artificial nails have been shown to harbor more pathogenic organisms, especially gram
negative  bacilli  and  yeasts,  on  the  nails  and  in  the  subungual  area  than  those  with
native  nails.720,  721  In  2002,  CDC/HICPAC  recommended  (Category  IA)  that  artificial
fingernails and extenders not be worn by healthcare personnel who have contact with
high-risk  patients  (e.g.,  those  in  ICUs,  ORs)  due  to  the  association  with  outbreaks  of
gram-negative  bacillus  and  candidal  infections  as  confirmed  by  molecular  typing  of
isolates.30, 31, 559, 722-725The need to restrict the wearing of artificial fingernails by
all healthcare personnel who provide direct patient care or by healthcare personnel who
have contact with other high risk groups (e.g., oncology, cystic fibrosis patients), has
not  been  studied,  but  has  been  recommended  by  some  experts.20  At  this  time  such
decisions are at the discretion of an individual facility's infection control program. There
is  less  evidence  that  jewelry  affects  the  quality  of  hand  hygiene.  Although  hand
contamination  with  potential  pathogens  is  increased  with  ring-wearing,559,  726  no
studies  have  related  this  practice  to  HCW-to-patient  transmission  of  pathogens.  PPE
refers to a variety of barriers and respirators used alone or in combination to protect
mucous  membranes,  airways,  skin,  and  clothing  from  contact  with  infectious  agents.
The selection of PPE is based on the nature of the patient interaction and/or the likely
mode(s)  of  transmission.  Guidance  on  the  use  of  PPE  is  discussed  in  Part  III.  A
suggested procedure for donning and removing PPE that will prevent skin or clothing
contamination is presented in the Figure. Designated containers for used disposable or
reusable PPE should be placed in a location that is convenient to the site of removal to
facilitate disposal and containment of contaminated materials. Hand hygiene is always
the final step after removing and disposing of PPE. The following sections highlight the
primary  uses  and  methods  for  selecting  this  equipment.  Gloves  are  used  to  prevent
contamination  of  healthcare  personnel  hands  when  Gloves  can  protect  both  patients
and healthcare personnel from exposure to infectious material that may be carried on
hands.73  The  extent  to  which  gloves  will  protect  healthcare  personnel  from
transmission of bloodborne pathogens (e.g., HIV, HBV, HCV) following a needlestick or
other  pucture  that  penetrates  the  glove  barrier  has  not  been  determined.  Although
gloves  may  reduce  the  volume  of  blood  on  the  external  surface  of  a  sharp  by
46-86%,729  the  residual  blood  in  the  lumen  of  a  hollowbore  needle  would  not  be
affected; therefore, the effect on transmission risk is unknown. Gloves manufactured for
healthcare  purposes  are  subject  to  FDA  evaluation  and  clearance.730  Nonsterile
disposable medical gloves made of a variety of materials (e.g., latex, vinyl, nitrile) are
available for routine patient care. 731 The selection of glove type for non-surgical use is
based on a number of factors, including the task that is to be performed, anticipated
contact  with  chemicals  and  chemotherapeutic  agents,  latex  sensitivity,  sizing,  and
facility policies for creating a latex-free environment.17, 732-734 For contact with blood
and  body  fluids  during  non-surgical  patient  care,  a  single  pair  of  gloves  generally
provides  adequate  barrier  protection.734  However,  there  is  considerable  variability
among  gloves;  both  the  quality  of  the  manufacturing  process  and  type  of  material
influence  their  barrier  effectiveness.735  While  there  is  little  difference  in  the  barrier
properties of unused intact gloves,736 studies have shown repeatedly that vinyl gloves
have higher failure rates than latex or nitrile gloves when tested under simulated and
actual clinical conditions.731, 735-738 For this reason either latex or nitrile gloves are
preferable for clinical procedures that require manual dexterity and/or will involve more
than brief patient contact. It may be necessary to stock gloves in several sizes. Heavier,
reusable utility gloves are indicated for non-patient care activities, such as handling or
cleaning  contaminated  equipment  or  surfaces.11,  14,  739  During  patient  care,
transmission  of  infectious  organisms  can  be  reduced  by  adhering  to  the  principles  of
working from "clean" to "dirty", and confining or limiting contamination to surfaces that
are directly needed for patient care. It may be necessary to change gloves during the
care  of  a  single  patient  to  prevent  cross-contamination  of  body  sites.559,  740  It  also
may  be  necessary  to  change  gloves  if  the  patient  interaction  also  involves  touching
portable computer keyboards or other mobile equipment that is transported from room
to  room.  Discarding  gloves  between  patients  is  necessary  to  prevent  transmission  of
infectious  material.  Gloves  must  not  be  washed  for  subsequent  reuse  because
microorganisms cannot be removed reliably from glove surfaces and continued glove
integrity  cannot  be  ensured.  Furthermore,  glove  reuse  has  been  associated  with
transmission  of  MRSA  and  gram-negative  bacilli.741-743  When  gloves  are  worn  in
combination with other PPE, they are put on last. Gloves that fit snugly around the wrist
are preferred for use with an isolation gown because they will cover the gown cuff and
provide a more reliable continuous barrier for the arms, wrists, and hands. Gloves that
are removed properly will prevent hand contamination (Figure). Hand hygiene following
glove  removal  further  ensures  that  the  hands  will  not  carry  potentially  infectious
material  that  might  have  penetrated  through  unrecognized  tears  or  that  could
contaminate the hands during glove removal.559, 728, 741 Isolation gowns are used as
specified by Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions, to protect the HCW's arms
and exposed body areas and prevent contamination of clothing with blood, body fluids,
and other potentially infectious material.24, 88, 262, 744-746 The need for and type of
isolation gown selected is based on the nature of the patient interaction, including the
anticipated degree of contact with infectious material and potential for blood and body
fluid  penetration  of  the  barrier.  The  wearing  of  isolation  gowns  and  other  protective
apparel  is  mandated  by  the  OSHA  Bloodborne  Pathogens  Standard.739  Clinical  and
laboratory coats or jackets worn over personal clothing for comfort and/or purposes of
identity are not considered PPE. When applying Standard Precautions, an isolation gown
is worn only if contact with blood or body fluid is anticipated. However, when Contact
Precautions  are  used  (i.e.,  to  prevent  transmission  of  an  infectious  agent  that  is  not
interrupted  by  Standard  Precautions  alone  and  that  is  associated  with  environmental
contamination),  donning  of  both  gown  and  gloves  upon  room  entry  is  indicated  to
address unintentional contact with contaminated environmental surfaces.54, 72, 73, 88
The routine donning of isolation gowns upon entry into an intensive care unit or other
high-risk  area  does  not  prevent  or  influence  potential  colonization  or  infection  of
patients in those areas.365, 747-750 Isolation gowns are always worn in combination
with gloves, and with other PPE when indicated. Gowns are usually the first piece of PPE
to be donned. Full coverage of the arms and body front, from neck to the mid-thigh or
below will ensure that clothing and exposed upper body areas are protected. Several
gown sizes should be available in a healthcare facility to ensure appropriate coverage
for staff members. Isolation gowns should be removed before leaving the patient care
area to prevent possible contamination of the environment outside the patient's room.
Isolation gowns should be removed in a manner that prevents contamination of clothing
or skin (Figure). The outer, "contaminated", side of the gown is turned inward and rolled
into  a  bundle,  and  then  discarded  into  a  designated  container  for  waste  or  linen  to
contain  contamination.  Masks  are  used  for  three  primary  purposes  in  healthcare
settings: Masks may be used in combination with goggles to protect the mouth, nose
and eyes, or a face shield may be used instead of a mask and goggles, to provide more
complete  protection  for  the  face,  as  discussed  below.  Masks  should  not  be  confused
with particulate respirators that are used to prevent inhalation of small particles that
may contain infectious agents transmitted via the airborne route as described below.
The mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes are susceptible portals of entry
for  infectious  agents,  as  can  be  other  skin  surfaces  if  skin  integrity  is  compromised
(e.g., by acne, dermatitis).66, 751-754 Therefore, use of PPE to protect these body sites
is an important component of Standard Precautions. The protective effect of masks for
exposed  healthcare  personnel  has  been  demonstrated.93,  113,  755,  756  Procedures
that generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions (e.g.,
endotracheal suctioning, bronchoscopy, invasive vascular procedures) require either a
face shield (disposable or reusable) or mask and goggles.93-95, 96, 113, 115, 262, 739,
757 The wearing of masks, eye protection, and face shields in specified circumstances
when  blood  or  body  fluid  exposures  are  likely  to  occur  is  mandated  by  the  OSHA
Bloodborne Pathogens Standard.739 Appropriate PPE should be selected based on the
anticipated  level  of  exposure.  Two  mask  types  are  available  for  use  in  healthcare
settings: surgical masks that are cleared by the FDA and required to have fluid-resistant
properties,  and  procedure  or  isolation  masks.758  #2688  No  studies  have  been
published  that  compare  mask  types  to  determine  whether  one  mask  type  provides
better  protection  than  another.  Since  procedure/isolation  masks  are  not  regulated  by
the FDA, there may be more variability in quality and performance than with surgical
masks. Masks come in various shapes (e.g., molded and non-molded), sizes, filtration
efficiency, and method of attachment (e.g., ties, elastic, ear loops). Healthcare facilities
may  find  that  different  types  of  masks  are  needed  to  meet  individual  healthcare
personnel  needs.  Guidance  on  eye  protection  for  infection  control  has  been
published.759 The eye protection chosen for specific work situations (e.g., goggles or
face shield) depends upon the circumstances of exposure, other PPE used, and personal
vision needs. Personal eyeglasses and contact lenses are NOT considered adequate eye
protection (NIOSH Eye Protection for Infection Control [Current version of this document
may  differ  from  original.]).  NIOSH  states  that,  eye  protection  must  be  comfortable,
allow for sufficient peripheral vision, and must be adjustable to ensure a secure fit. It
may  be  necessary  to  provide  several  different  types,  styles,  and  sizes  of  protective
equipment.  Indirectly-vented  goggles  with  a  manufacturer's  anti-fog  coating  may
provide the most reliable practical eye protection from splashes, sprays, and respiratory
droplets  from  multiple  angles.  Newer  styles  of  goggles  may  provide  better  indirect
airflow properties to reduce fogging, as well as better peripheral vision and more size
options  for  fitting  goggles  to  different  workers.  Many  styles  of  goggles  fit  adequately
over prescription glasses with minimal gaps. While effective as eye protection, goggles
do not provide splash or spray protection to other parts of the face. The role of goggles,
in  addition  to  a  mask,  in  preventing  exposure  to  infectious  agents  transmitted  via
respiratory droplets has been studied only for RSV. Reports published in the mid-1980s
demonstrated that eye protection reduced occupational transmission of RSV.760, 761
Whether this was due to preventing hand-eye contact or respiratory droplet-eye contact
has  not  been  determined.  However,  subsequent  studies  demonstrated  that  RSV
transmission is effectively prevented by adherence to Standard plus Contact Precations
and that for this virus routine use of goggles is not necessary.24, 116, 117, 684, 762 It
is  important  to  remind  healthcare  personnel  that  even  if  Droplet  Precautions  are  not
recommended  for  a  specific  respiratory  tract  pathogen,  protection  for  the  eyes,  nose
and mouth by using a mask and goggles, or face shield alone, is necessary when it is
likely that there will be a splash or spray of any respiratory secretions or other body
fluids  as  defined  in  Standard  Precautions.  Disposable  or  non-disposable  face  shields
may be used as an alternative to goggles.759 As compared with goggles, a face shield
can  provide  protection  to  other  facial  areas  in  addition  to  the  eyes.  Face  shields
extending from chin to crown provide better face and eye protection from splashes and
sprays; face shields that wrap around the sides may reduce splashes around the edge
of the shield. Removal of a face shield, goggles and mask can be performed safely after
gloves have been removed, and hand hygiene performed. The ties, ear pieces and/or
headband  used  to  secure  the  equipment  to  the  head  are  considered  "clean"  and
therefore safe to touch with bare hands. The front of a mask, goggles and face shield
are considered contaminated (Figure). The subject of respiratory protection as it applies
to  preventing  transmission  of  airborne  infectious  agents,  including  the  need  for  and
frequency  of  fit-testing  is  under  scientific  review  and  was  the  subject  of  a  CDC
workshop in 2004.763 Respiratory protection currently requires the use of a respirator
with  N95  or  higher  filtration  to  prevent  inhalation  of  infectious  particles.  Information
about respirators and respiratory protection programs is summarized in the Guideline
for  Preventing  Transmission  of  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  in  Health-care  Settings,
2005 (CDC.MMWR 2005; 54: RR-17 12). Respiratory protection is broadly regulated by
OSHA
 under
 the
 general
 industry
 standard
 for
 respiratory
 protection
(29CFR1910.134)764  which  requires  that  U.S.  employers  in  all  employment  settings
implement  a  program  to  protect  employees  from  inhalation  of  toxic  materials.  OSHA
program components include medical clearance to wear a respirator; provision and use
of  appropriate  respirators,  including  fit-tested  NIOSH-certified  N95  and  higher
particulate filtering respirators; education on respirator use and periodic re-evaluation
of  the  respiratory  protection  program.  When  selecting  particulate  respirators,  models
with  inherently  good  fit  characteristics  (i.e.,  those  expected  to  provide  protection
factors of 10 or more to 95% of wearers) are preferred and could theoretically relieve
the need for fit testing.765, 766 Issues pertaining to respiratory protection remain the
subject of ongoing debate. Information on various types of respirators may be found at
[This link is no longer active: www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/respsars.html. Similar
information  may  be  found  at  NIOSH  Respirators.]  and  in  published  studies.765,  767,
768 A user-seal check (formerly called a "fit check") should be performed by the wearer
of  a  respirator  each  time  a  respirator  is  donned  to  minimize  air  leakage  around  the
facepiece.769 The optimal frequency of fit-testing has not been determined; re-testing
may be indicated if there is a change in facial features of the wearer, onset of a medical
condition that would affect respiratory function in the wearer, or a change in the model
or  size  of  the  initially  assigned  respirator.12  Respiratory  protection  was  first
recommended for protection of preventing U.S. healthcare personnel from exposure to
M. tuberculosis in 1989. That recommendation has been maintained in two successive
revisions of the Guidelines for Prevention of Transmission of Tuberculosis in Hospitals
and other Healthcare Settings.12, 126 The incremental benefit from respirator use, in
addition  to  administrative  and  engineering  controls  (i.e.,  AIIRs,  early  recognition  of
patients likely to have tuberculosis and prompt placement in an AIIR, and maintenance
of  a  patient  with  suspected  tuberculosis  in  an  AIIR  until  no  longer  infectious),  for
preventing  transmission  of  airborne  infectious  agents  (e.g.,  M.  tuberculosis)  is
undetermined.  Although  some  studies  have  demonstrated  effective  prevention  of  M.
tuberculosis  transmission  in  hospitals  where  surgical  masks,  instead  of  respirators,
were used in conjunction with other administrative and engineering controls,637, 770,
771 CDC currently recommends N95 or higher level respirators for personnel exposed
to patients with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis. Currently this is also true for other
diseases that could be transmitted through the airborne route, including SARS 262 and
smallpox,108,
 129,
 772
 until
 inhalational
 transmission
 is
 better
 defined
 or
healthcare-specific protective equipment more suitable for for preventing infection are
developed.  Respirators  are  also  currently  recommended  to  be  worn  during  the
performance  of  aerosol-generating  procedures  (e.g.,  intubation,  bronchoscopy,
suctioning)  on  patients  with  SARS  Co-V  infection,  avian  influenza  and  pandemic
influenza  (See  Appendix  A).  Although  Airborne  Precautions  are  recommended  for
preventing airborne transmission of measles and varicella-zoster viruses, there are no
data  upon  which  to  base  a  recommendation  for  respiratory  protection  to  protect
susceptible  personnel  against  these  two  infections;  transmission  of  varicella-zoster
virus  has  been  prevented  among  pediatric  patients  using  negative  pressure  isolation
alone.773 Whether respiratory protection (i.e., wearing a particulate respirator) would
enhance  protection  from  these  viruses  has  not  been  studied.  Since  the  majority  of
healthcare personnel have natural or acquired immunity to these viruses, only immune
personnel generally care for patients with these infections.774-777 Although there is no
evidence  to  suggest  that  masks  are  not  adequate  to  protect  healthcare  personnel  in
these settings, for purposes of consistency and simplicity, or because of difficulties in
ascertaining immunity, some facilities may require the use of respirators for entry into
all  AIIRs,  regardless  of  the  specific  infectious  agent.  Procedures  for  safe  removal  of
respirators  are  provided  (Figure).  In  some  healthcare  settings,  particulate  respirators
used  to  provide  care  for  patients  with  M.  tuberculosis  are  reused  by  the  same  HCW.
This is an acceptable practice providing the respirator is not damaged or soiled, the fit
is not compromised by change in shape, and the respirator has not been contaminated
with blood or body fluids. There are no data on which to base a recommendation for the
length  of  time  a  respirator  may  be  reused.  Injuries  due  to  needles  and  other  sharps
have  been  associated  with  transmission  of  HBV,  HCV  and  HIV  to  healthcare
personnel.778,  779  The  prevention  of  sharps  injuries  has  always  been  an  essential
element of Universal and now Standard Precautions.1, 780 These include measures to
handle needles and other sharp devices in a manner that will prevent injury to the user
and  to  others  who  may  encounter  the  device  during  or  after  a  procedure.  These
measures  apply  to  routine  patient  care  and  do  not  address  the  prevention  of  sharps
injuries and other blood exposures during surgical and other invasive procedures that
are  addressed  elsewhere.781-785  Since  1991,  when  OSHA  first  issued  its  Bloodborne
Pathogens Standard to protect healthcare personnel from blood exposure, the focus of
regulatory  and  legislative  activity  has  been  on  implementing  a  hierarchy  of  control
measures.  This  has  included  focusing  attention  on  removing  sharps  hazards  through
the development and use of engineering controls. The federal Needlestick Safety and
Prevention  Act  signed  into  law  in  November,  2000  authorized  OSHA's  revision  of  its
Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to more explicitly require the use of safety-engineered
sharp  devices.786  CDC  has  provided  guidance  on  sharps  injury  prevention,787,  788
including  for  the  design,  implementation  and  evaluation  of  a  comprehensive  sharps
injury prevention program.789 Exposure of mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and
mouth  to  blood  and  body  fluids  has  been  associated  with  the  transmission  of
bloodborne viruses and other infectious agents to healthcare personnel.66, 752, 754,
779  The  prevention  of  mucous  membrane  exposures  has  always  been  an  element  of
Universal and now Standard Precautions for routine patient care 1, 753 and is subject to
OSHA  bloodborne  pathogen  regulations.  Safe  work  practices,  in  addition  to  wearing
PPE,  are  used  to  protect  mucous  membranes  and  non-intact  skin  from  contact  with
potentially infectious material. These include keeping gloved and ungloved hands that
are  contaminated  from  touching  the  mouth,  nose,  eyes,  or  face;  and  positioning
patients  to  direct  sprays  and  splatter  away  from  the  face  of  the  caregiver.  Careful
placement  of  PPE  before  patient  contact  will  help  avoid  the  need  to  make  PPE
adjustments  and  possible  face  or  mucous  membrane  contamination  during  use.  In
areas  where  the  need  for  resuscitation  is  unpredictable,  mouthpieces,  pocket
resuscitation  masks  with  one-way  valves,  and  other  ventilation  devices  provide  an
alternative  to  mouth-to-mouth  resuscitation,  preventing  exposure  of  the  caregiver's
nose and mouth to oral and respiratory fluids during the procedure. The performance of
procedures that can generate small particle aerosols (aerosol-generating procedures),
such as bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and open suctioning of the respiratory
tract,  have  been  associated  with  transmission  of  infectious  agents  to  healthcare
personnel,  including  M.  tuberculosis,790  SARS-CoV  93,  94,  98  and  N.  meningitidis.95
Protection  of  the  eyes,  nose  and  mouth,  in  addition  to  gown  and  gloves,  is
recommended  during  performance  of  these  procedures  in  accordance  with  Standard
Precautions. Use of a particulate respirator is recommended during aerosol-generating
procedures when the aerosol is likely to contain M. tuberculosis, SARS-CoV, or avian or
pandemic influenza viruses. Options for patient placement include single patient rooms,
two  patient  rooms,  and  multi-bed  wards.  Of  these,  single  patient  rooms  are  prefered
when  there  is  a  concern  about  transmission  of  an  infectious  agent.  Although  some
studies  have  failed  to  demonstrate  the  efficacy  of  single  patient  rooms  to  prevent
HAIs,791  other  published  studies,  including  one  commissioned  by  the  American
Institute  of  Architects  and  the  Facility  Guidelines  Institute,  have  documented  a
beneficial  relationship  between  private  rooms  and  reduction  in  infectious  and
noninfectious adverse patient outcomes.792, 793 The AIA notes that private rooms are
the trend in hospital planning and design. However, most hospitals and long-term care
facilities  have  multi-bed  rooms  and  must  consider  many  competing  priorities  when
determining the appropriate room placement for patients (e.g., reason for admission;
patient  characteristics,  such  as  age,  gender,  mental  status;  staffing  needs;  family
requests;  psychosocial  factors;  reimbursement  concerns).  In  the  absence  of  obvious
infectious  diseases  that  require  specified  airborne  infection  isolation  rooms  (e.g.,
tuberculosis,  SARS,  chickenpox),  the  risk  of  transmission  of  infectious  agents  is  not
always  considered  when  making  placement  decisions.  When  there  are  only  a  limited
number of single-patient rooms, it is prudent to prioritize them for those patients who
have conditions that facilitate transmission of infectious material to other patients (e.g.,
draining wounds, stool incontinence, uncontained secretions) and for those who are at
increased  risk  of  acquisition  and  adverse  outcomes  resulting  from  HAI  (e.g.,
immunosuppression, open wounds, indwelling catheters, anticipated prolonged length
of stay, total dependence on HCWs for activities of daily living).15, 24, 43, 430, 794,
795  Single-patient  rooms  are  always  indicated  for  patients  placed  on  Airborne
Precautionsand in a Protective Environment and are preferred for patients who require
Contact or Droplet Precautions.23, 24, 410, 435, 796, 797 During a suspected or proven
outbreak  caused  by  a  pathogen  whose  reservoir  is  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  use  of
single  patient  rooms  with  private  bathrooms  limits  opportunities  for  transmission,
especially  when  the  colonized  or  infected  patient  has  poor  personal  hygiene  habits,
fecal  incontinence,  or  cannot  be  expected  to  assist  in  maintaining  procedures  that
prevent  transmission  of  microorganisms  (e.g.,  infants,  children,  and  patients  with
altered  mental  status  or  developmental  delay).  In  the  absence  of  continued
transmission, it is not necessary to provide a private bathroom for patients colonized or
infected  with  enteric  pathogens  as  long  as  personal  hygiene  practices  and  Standard
Precautions,  especially  hand  hygiene  and  appropriate  environmental  cleaning,  are
maintained.  Assignment  of  a  dedicated  commode  to  a  patient,and  cleaning  and
disinfecting  fixtures  and  equipment  that  may  have  fecal  contamination  (e.g.,
bathrooms, commodes,798 scales used for weighing diapers) and the adjacent surfaces
with appropriate agents may be especially important when a single-patient room can
not be used since environmental contamination with intestinal tract pathogens is likely
from  both  continent  and  incontinent  patients.54,  799  Results  of  several  studies  to
determine the benefit of a single-patient room to prevent transmission of Clostridium
difficile are inconclusive.167, 800-802 Some studies have shown that being in the same
room  with  a  colonized  or  infected  patient  is  not  necessarily  a  risk  factor  for
transmission.791,  803-805  However,  for  children,  the  risk  of  healthcare-associated
diarrhea is increased with the increased number of patients per room.806 Thus, patient
factors are important determinants of infection transmission risks, and the need for a
single-patient  room  and/or  private  bathroom  for  any  patient  is  best  determined  on  a
case-by-case  basis.  Cohorting  is  the  practice  of  grouping  together  patients  who  are
colonized  or  infected  with  the  same  organism  to  confine  their  care  to  one  area  and
prevent  contact  with  other  patients.  Cohorts  are  created  based  on  clinical  diagnosis,
microbiologic confirmation when available, epidemiology, and mode of transmission of
the infectious agent. It is generally preferred not to place severely immunosuppressed
patients  in  rooms  with  other  patients.  Cohorting  has  been  used  extensively  for
managing  outbreaks  of  MDROs  including  MRSA,22,  807  VRE,638,  808,  809
MDR-ESBLs;810  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa;  29  methicillin-susceptible  Staphylococcus
aureus;811  RSV;812,  813  adenovirus  keratoconjunctivitis;814  rotavirus;815  and
SARS.816 Modeling studies provide additional support for cohorting patients to control
outbreaks  Talon.817-819  However,  cohorting  often  is  implemented  only  after  routine
infection  control  measures  have  failed  to  control  an  outbreak.  Assigning  or  cohorting
healthcare personnel to care only for patients infected or colonized with a single target
pathogen limits further transmission of the target pathogen to uninfected patients 740,
819 but is difficult to achieve in the face of current staffing shortages in hospitals 583
and  residential  healthcare  sites.820-822  However,  when  continued  transmission  is
occurring  after  implementing  routine  infection  control  measures  and  creating  patient
cohorts, cohorting of healthcare personnel may be beneficial. During the seasons when
RSV,
 human
 metapneumovirus,823
 parainfluenza,
 influenza,
 other
 respiratory
viruses,824  and  rotavirus  are  circulating  in  the  community,  cohorting  based  on  the
presenting  clinical  syndrome  is  often  a  priority  in  facilities  that  care  for  infants  and
young  children.825  For  example,  during  the  respiratory  virus  season,  infants  may  be
cohorted  based  solely  on  the  clinical  diagnosis  of  bronchiolitis  due  to  the  logistical
difficulties and costs associated with requiring microbiologic confirmation prior to room
placement, and the predominance of RSV during most of the season. However, when
available,  single  patient  rooms  are  always  preferred  since  a  common  clinical
presentation (e.g., bronchiolitis), can be caused by more than one infectious agent.823,
824, 826 Furthermore, the inability of infants and children to contain body fluids, and
the  close  physical  contact  that  occurs  during  their  care,  increases  infection
transmission  risks  for  patients  and  personnel  in  this  setting.24,  795  Patients  actively
infected  with  or  incubating  transmissible  infectious  diseases  are  seen  frequently  in
ambulatory
 settings
 (e.g.,
 outpatient
 clinics,
 physicians'
 offices,
 emergency
departments)  and  potentially  expose  healthcare  personnel  and  other  patients,  family
members and visitors.21, 34, 127, 135, 142, 827 In response to the global outbreak of
SARS in 2003 and in preparation for pandemic influenza, healthcare providers working
in  outpatient  settings  are  urged  to  implement  source  containment  measures  (e.g.,
asking coughing patients to wear a surgical mask or cover their coughs with tissues) to
prevent transmission of respiratory infections, beginning at the point of initial patient
encounter 9, 262, 828 as described below in section III.A.1.a. Signs can be posted at the
entrance to facilities or at the reception or registration desk requesting that the patient
or  individuals  accompanying  the  patient  promptly  inform  the  receptionist  if  there  are
symptoms of a respiratory infection (e.g., cough, flu-like illness, increased production of
respiratory  secretions).  The  presence  of  diarrhea,  skin  rash,  or  known  or  suspected
exposure to a transmissible disease (e.g., measles, pertussis, chickenpox, tuberculosis)
also  could  be  added.  Placement  of  potentially  infectious  patients  without  delay  in  an
examination  room  limits  the  number  of  exposed  individuals,  e.g.,  in  the  common
waiting  area.  See  Interim  Infection  Prevention  and  Control  Recommendations  for
Measles  in  Healthcare  Settings.  In  waiting  areas,  maintaining  a  distance  between
symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients (e.g., >3 feet), in addition to source control
measures, may limit exposures. However, infections transmitted via the airborne route
(e.g., M tuberculosis, measles, chickenpox) require additional precautions.12, 125, 829
Patients  suspected  of  having  such  an  infection  can  wear  a  surgical  mask  for  source
containment, if tolerated, and should be placed in an examination room, preferably an
AIIR,  as  soon  as  possible.  If  this  is  not  possible,  having  the  patient  wear  a  mask  and
segregate him/herself from other patients in the waiting area will reduce opportunities
to expose others. Since the person(s) accompanying the patient also may be infectious,
application of the same infection control precautions may need to be extended to these
persons  if  they  are  symptomatic.21,  252,  830  For  example,  family  members
accompanying  children  admitted  with  suspected  M.  tuberculosis  have  been  found  to
have
 unsuspected
 pulmonary
 tuberculosis
 with
 cavitary
 lesions,
 even
 when
asymptomatic.42,  831  Patients  with  underlying  conditions  that  increase  their
susceptibility  to  infection  (e.g.,  those  who  are  immunocompromised  43,  44  or  have
cystic  fibrosis  20)  require  special  efforts  to  protect  them  from  exposures  to  infected
patients in common waiting areas. By informing the receptionist of their infection risk
upon arrival, appropriate steps may be taken to further protect them from infection. In
some cystic fibrosis clinics, in order to avoid exposure to other patients who could be
colonized with B. cepacia, patients have been given beepers upon registration so that
they may leave the area and receive notification to return when an examination room
becomes  available.832  In  home  care,  the  patient  placement  concerns  focus  on
protecting others in the home from exposure to an infectious household member. For
individuals who are especially vulnerable to adverse outcomes associated with certain
infections,  it  may  be  beneficial  to  either  remove  them  from  the  home  or  segregate
them  within  the  home.  Persons  who  are  not  part  of  the  household  may  need  to  be
prohibited from visiting during the period of infectivity. For example, if a patient with
pulmonary tuberculosis is contagious and being cared for at home, very young children
(<4  years  of  age)  833  and  immunocompromised  persons  who  have  not  yet  been
infected should be removed or excluded from the household. During the SARS outbreak
of 2003, segregation of infected persons during the communicable phase of the illness
was  beneficial  in  preventing  household  transmission.249,  834  Several  principles  are
used  to  guide  transport  of  patients  requiring  Transmission-Based  Precautions.  In  the
inpatient and residential settings these include For tuberculosis, additional precautions
may be needed in a small shared air space such as in an ambulance.12 Cleaning and
disinfecting non-critical surfaces in patient-care areas are part of Standard Precautions.
In  general,  these  procedures  do  not  need  to  be  changed  for  patients  on
Transmission-Based Precautions. The cleaning and disinfection of all patient-care areas
is  important  for  frequently  touched  surfaces,  especially  those  closest  to  the  patient,
that  are  most  likely  to  be  contaminated  (e.g.,  bedrails,  bedside  tables,  commodes,
doorknobs, sinks, surfaces and equipment in close proximity to the patient).11, 72, 73,
835 The frequency or intensity of cleaning may need to change based on the patient's
level  of  hygiene  and  the  degree  of  environmental  contamination  and  for  certain  for
infectious agents whose reservoir is the intestinal tract.54 This may be especially true
in  LTCFs  and  pediatric  facilities  where  patients  with  stool  and  urine  incontinence  are
encountered more frequently. Also, increased frequency of cleaning may be needed in
a Protective Environment to minimize dust accumulation.11 Special recommendations
for  cleaning  and  disinfecting  environmental  surfaces  in  dialysis  centers  have  been
published.18 In all healthcare settings, administrative, staffing and scheduling activities
should  prioritize  the  proper  cleaning  and  disinfection  of  surfaces  that  could  be
implicated  in  transmission.  During  a  suspected  or  proven  outbreak  where  an
environmental reservoir is suspected, routine cleaning procedures should be reviewed,
and the need for additional trained cleaning staff should be assessed. Adherence should
be monitored and reinforced to promote consistent and correct cleaning is performed.
EPA-registered  disinfectants  or  detergents/disinfectants  that  best  meet  the  overall
needs  of  the  healthcare  facility  for  routine  cleaning  and  disinfection  should  be
selected.11, 836 In general, use of the existing facility detergent/disinfectant according
to  the  manufacturer's  recommendations  for  amount,  dilution,  and  contact  time  is
sufficient  to  remove  pathogens  from  surfaces  of  rooms  where  colonized  or  infected
individuals  were  housed.  This  includes  those  pathogens  that  are  resistant  to  multiple
classes of antimicrobial agents (e.g., C. difficile, VRE, MRSA, MDR-GNB 11, 24, 88, 435,
746, 796, 837). Most often, environmental reservoirs of pathogensduring outbreaks are
related  to  a  failure  to  follow  recommended  procedures  for  cleaning  and  disinfection
rather  than  the  specific  cleaning  and  disinfectant  agents  used.838-841  Certain
pathogens (e.g., rotavirus, noroviruses, C. difficile) may be resistant to some routinely
used  hospital  disinfectants.275,  292,  842-847The  role  of  specific  disinfectants  in
limiting  transmission  of  rotavirus  has  been  demonstrated  experimentally.842  Also,
since  C.  difficile  may  display  increased  levels  of  spore  production  when  exposed  to
non-chlorine-based cleaning agents, and the spores are more resistant than vegetative
cells to commonly used surface disinfectants, some investigators have recommended
the use of a 1:10 dilution of 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) and water
for routine environmental disinfection of rooms of patients with C. difficile when there is
continued transmission.844, 848 In one study, the use of a hypochlorite solution was
associated  with  a  decrease  in  rates  of  C.  difficile  infections.847  The  need  to  change
disinfectants  based  on  the  presence  of  these  organisms  can  be  determined  in
consultation

 Detailed
recommendations for disinfection and sterilization of surfaces and medical equipment
that have been in contact with prion-containing tissue or high risk body fluids, and for
cleaning  of  blood  and  body  substance  spills,  are  available  in  the  Guidelines  for
Environmental  Infection  Control  in  Health-Care  Facilities  11  and  in  the  Guideline  for
Disinfection and Sterilization.848 Medical equipment and instruments/devices must be
cleaned  and  maintained  according  to  the  manufacturers'  instructions  to  prevent
patient-to-patient  transmission  of  infectious  agents.86,  87,  325,  849  Cleaning  to
remove organic material must always precede high level disinfection and sterilization of
critical  and  semi-critical  instruments  and  devices  because  residual  proteinacous
material  reduces  the  effectiveness  of  the  disinfection  and  sterilization  processes.836,
848  Noncritical  equipment,  such  as  commodes,  intravenous  pumps,  and  ventilators,
must  be  thoroughly  cleaned  and  disinfected  before  use  on  another  patient.  All  such
equipment  and  devices  should  be  handled  in  a  manner  that  will  prevent  HCW  and
environmental  contact  with  potentially  infectious  material.  It  is  important  to  include
computers  and  personal  digital  assistants  (PDAs)  used  in  patient  care  in  policies  for
cleaning  and  disinfection  of  non-critical  items.  The  literature  on  contamination  of
computers  with  pathogens  has  been  summarized  850  and  two  reports  have  linked
computer  contamination  to  colonization  and  infections  in  patients.851,  852  Although
keyboard covers and washable keyboards that can be easily disinfected are in use, the
infection  control  benefit  of  those  items  and  optimal  management  have  not  been
determined.

Transmission-Based  Precautions  with  dedicated  noncritical  medical  equipment  (e.g.,
stethoscope,  blood  pressure  cuff,  electronic  thermometer)  has  been  beneficial  for
preventing  transmission.74,  89,  740,  853,  854  When  this  is  not  possible,  disinfection
after use is recommended. Consult other guidelines for detailed guidance in developing
specific  protocols  for  cleaning  and  reprocessing  medical  equipment  and  patient  care
items in both routine and special circumstances.11, 14, 18, 20, 740, 836, 848 In home
care,  it  is  preferable  to  remove  visible  blood  or  body  fluids  from  durable  medical
equipment  before  it  leaves  the  home.  Equipment  can  be  cleaned  on-site  using  a
detergent/disinfectant and, when possible, should be placed in a single plastic bag for
transport to the reprocessing location.20, 739 Soiled textiles, including bedding, towels,
and patient or resident clothing may be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms.
However, the risk of disease transmission is negligible if they are handled, transported,
and laundered in a safe manner.11, 855, 856 Key principles for handling soiled laundry
are  The  methods  for  handling,  transporting,  and  laundering  soiled  textiles  are
determined  by  organizational  policy  and  any  applicable  regulations;739  guidance  is
provided in the Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control.11 Rather than rigid rules
and regulations, hygienic and common sense storage and processing of clean textiles is
recommended.11,  857  When  laundering  occurs  outside  of  a  healthcare  facility,  the
clean items must be packaged or completely covered and placed in an enclosed space
during  transport  to  prevent  contamination  with  outside  air  or  construction  dust  that
could  contain  infectious  fungal  spores  that  are  a  risk  for  immunocompromised
patients.11  Institutions  are  required  to  launder  garments  used  as  personal  protective
equipment  and  uniforms  visibly  soiled  with  blood  or  infective  material.739  There  are
few data to determine the safety of home laundering of HCW uniforms, but no increase
in infection rates was observed in the one published study 858 and no pathogens were
recovered from home- or hospital-laundered scrubs in another study.859 In the home,
textiles  and  laundry  from  patients  with  potentially  transmissible  infectious  pathogens
do not require special handling or separate laundering, and may be washed with warm
water and detergent.11, 858, 859 The management of solid waste emanating from the
healthcare  environment  is  subject  to  federal  and  state  regulations  for  medical  and
non-medical waste.860, 861 No additional precautions are needed for non-medical solid
waste  that  is  being  removed  from  rooms  of  patients  on  Transmission-Based
Precautions. Solid waste may be contained in a single bag (as compared to using two
bags) of sufficient strength.862 The combination of hot water and detergents used in
dishwashers is sufficient to decontaminate dishware and eating utensils. Therefore, no
special  precautions  are  needed  for  dishware  (e.g.,  dishes,  glasses,  cups)  or  eating
utensils;  reusable  dishware  and  utensils  may  be  used  for  patients  requiring
Transmission-Based  Precautions.  In  the  home  and  other  communal  settings,  eating
utensils and drinking vessels that are being used should not be shared, consistent with
principles of good personal hygiene and for the purpose of preventing transmission of
respiratory  viruses,  Herpes  simplex  virus,  and  infectious  agents  that  infect  the
gastrointestinal tract and are transmitted by the fecal/oral route (e.g., hepatitis A virus,
noroviruses). If adequate resources for cleaning utensils and dishes are not available,
disposable  products  may  be  used.  Important  adjunctive  measures  that  are  not
considered  primary  components  of  programs  to  prevent  transmission  of  infectious
agents, but improve the effectiveness of such programs, include Detailed discussion of
judicious  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  document;  however
the  topic  is  addressed  in  the  Management  of  Multidrug-Resistant  Organisms  in
Healthcare Settings 2006. Antimicrobial agents and topical antiseptics may be used to
prevent  infection  and  potential  outbreaks  of  selected  agents.  Infections  for  which
postexposure  chemoprophylaxis  is  recommended  under  defined  conditions  include  B.
pertussis,  17,  863  N.  meningitidis,864  B.  anthracis  after  environmental  exposure  to
aeosolizable  material,865  influenza  virus,611  HIV,866  and  group  A  streptococcus.160
Orally administered antimicrobials may also be used under defined circumstances for
MRSA  decolonization  of  patients  or  healthcare  personnel.867  Another  form  of
chemoprophylaxis is the use of topical antiseptic agents. For example, triple dye is used
routinely  on  the  umbilical  cords  of  term  newborns  to  reduce  the  risk  of  colonization,
skin  infections,  and  omphalitis  caused  by  S.  aureus,  including  MRSA,  and  group  A
streptococcus.868, 869 Extension of the use of triple dye to low birth weight infants in
the  NICU  was  one  component  of  a  program  that  controlled  one  longstanding  MRSA
outbreak.22 Topical antiseptics are also used for decolonization of healthcare personnel
or selected patients colonized with MRSA, using mupirocin as discussed in the MDRO
guideline.870  867,  871-873  Certain  immunizations  recommended  for  susceptible
healthcare  personnel  have  decreased  the  risk  of  infection  and  the  potential  for
transmission in healthcare facilities.17, 874 The OSHA mandate that requires employers
to offer hepatitis B vaccination to HCWs played a substantial role in the sharp decline in
incidence  of  occupational  HBV  infection.778,  875  The  use  of  varicella  vaccine  in
healthcare  personnel  has  decreased  the  need  to  place  susceptible  HCWs  on
administrative  leave  following  exposure  to  patients  with  varicella.775  Also,  reports  of
healthcare-associated transmission of rubella in obstetrical clinics 33, 876 and measles
in acute care settings 34 demonstrate the importance of immunization of susceptible
healthcare  personnel  against  childhood  diseases.  Many  states  have  requirements  for
HCW  vaccination  for  measles  and  rubella  in  the  absence  of  evidence  of  immunity.
Annual influenza vaccine campaigns targeted to patients and healthcare personnel in
LTCFs  and  acute-care  settings  have  been  instrumental  in  preventing  or  limiting
institutional  outbreaks  and  increasing  attention  is  being  directed  toward  improving
influenza  vaccination  rates  in  healthcare  personnel.35,  611,  690,  877,  878,  879
Transmission of B. pertussis in healthcare facilities has been associated with large and
costly outbreaks that include both healthcare personnel and patients.17, 36, 41, 100,
683,  827,  880,  881  HCWs  who  have  close  contact  with  infants  with  pertussis  are  at
particularly  high  risk  because  of  waning  immunity  and,  until  2005,  the  absence  of  a
vaccine  that  could  be  used  in  adults.  However,  two  acellular  pertussis  vaccines  were
licensed in the United States in 2005, one for use in individuals aged 11-18 and one for
use  in  ages  10-64  years.882  Provisional  ACIP  recommendations  at  the  time  of
publication  of  this  document  include  adolescents  and  adults,  especially  those  with
contact with infants < 12 months of age and healthcare personnel with direct patient
contact.883 884 Immunization of children and adults will help prevent the introduction
of
 vaccine-preventable
 diseases
 into
 healthcare
 settings.
 The
 recommended
immunization  schedule  for  children  is  published  annually  in  the  January  issues  of  the
Morbidity  Mortality  Weekly  Report  with  interim  updates  as  needed.885,  886  An  adult
immunization  schedule  also  is  available  for  healthy  adults  and  those  with  special
immunization  needs  due  to  high  risk  medical  conditions.887  Some  vaccines  are  also
used  for  postexposure  prophylaxis  of  susceptible  individuals,  including  varicella,888
influenza,611  hepatitis  B,778  and  smallpox  225  vaccines.17,  874  In  the  future,
administration  of  a  newly  developed  S.  aureus  conjugate  vaccine  (still  under
investigation)  to  selected  patients  may  provide  a  novel  method  of  preventing
healthcare-associated  S.  aureus,  including  MRSA,  infections  in  high-risk  groups  (e.g.,
hemodialysis  patients  and  candidates  for  selected  surgical  procedures).889,  890
Visitors have been identified as the source of several types of HAIs (e.g., pertussis,40,
41 M. tuberculosis,42, 892 influenza, and other respiratory viruses 24, 43, 44, 373 and
SARS  21,  252-254).  However,  effective  methods  for  visitor  screening  in  healthcare
settings  have  not  been  studied.  Visitor  screening  is  especially  important  during
community outbreaks of infectious diseases and for high risk patient units. Sibling visits
are often encouraged in birthing centers, post partum rooms and in pediatric inpatient
units, ICUs, and in residential settings for children; in hospital settings, a child visitor
should visit only his or her own sibling. Screening of visiting siblings and other children
before they are allowed into clinical areas is necessary to prevent the introduction of
childhood  illnesses  and  common  respiratory  infections.  Screening  may  be  passive
through the use of signs to alert family members and visitors with signs and symptoms
of  communicable  diseases  not  to  enter  clinical  areas.  More  active  screening  may
include  the  completion  of  a  screening  tool  or  questionnaire  which  elicits  information
related to recent exposures or current symptoms. That information is reviewed by the
facility  staff  and  the  visitor  is  either  permitted  to  visit  or  is  excluded.833  Family  and
household  members  visiting  pediatric  patients  with  pertussis  and  tuberculosis  may
need to be screened for a history of exposure as well as signs and symptoms of current
infection.  Potentially  infectious  visitors  are  excluded  until  they  receive  appropriate
medical screening, diagnosis, or treatment. If exclusion is not considered to be in the
best  interest  of  the  patient  or  family  (i.e.,  primary  family  members  of  critically  or
terminally  ill  patients),  then  the  symptomatic  visitor  must  wear  a  mask  while  in  the
healthcare  facility  and  remain  in  the  patient's  room,  avoiding  exposure  to  others,
especially  in  public  waiting  areas  and  the  cafeteria.  Visitor  screening  is  used
consistently on HSCT units.15, 43 However, considering the experience during the 2003
SARS outbreaks and the potential for pandemic influenza, developing effective visitor
screening systems will be beneficial.9 Education concerning Respiratory Hygiene/Cough
Etiquette is a useful adjunct to visitor screening. The use of gowns, gloves, or masks by
visitors  in  healthcare  settings  has  not  been  addressed  specifically  in  the  scientific
literature. Some studies included the use of gowns and gloves by visitors in the control
of MDRO's, but did not perform a separate analysis to determine whether their use by
visitors  had  a  measurable  impact.893-895  Family  members  or  visitors  who  are
providing care or having very close patient contact (e.g., feeding, holding) may have
contact with other patients and could contribute to transmission if barrier precautions
are not used correctly. Specific recommendations may vary by facility or by unit and
should be determined by the level of interaction. CDC provides information on infection
control  and  clinical  safety  to  help  reduce  the  risk  of  infections  among  healthcare
workers, patients, and visitors. Languages Language Assistance Languages  Language
