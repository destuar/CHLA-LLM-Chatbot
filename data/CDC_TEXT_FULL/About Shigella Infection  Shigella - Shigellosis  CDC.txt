shigellosis.  Shigella  cause  an  estimated  450,000  infections  in  the  United  States  each
year, and antimicrobial resistant infections result in an estimated $93 million in direct
medical costs. The four species of Shigella are: S. dysenteriae and S. boydii are rare in
the United States, though they continue to be important causes of disease in areas with
less access to resources. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can be deadly. Symptoms usually
start 1â€“2 days after infection and last 7 days. Most people with shigellosis experience:
Some groups of people are more likely to get sick with shigellosis than others.  Shigella
spreads easily; swallowing just a small amount of Shigella germs can make you sick.
Shigella germs are in poop, so anything that gets contaminated by poop can potentially
spread  the  germs.  Shigella  can  spread  from  one  person  to  another  or  through
contaminated water, food, surfaces, or objects. You can take steps to avoid getting or
spreading  Shigella.  People  who  have  shigellosis  usually  get  better  without  antibiotic
treatment in 5 to 7 days. People with mild shigellosis may need only fluids and rest. 
Your healthcare provider may prescribe medicine to treat illness caused by Shigella. If
you  have  diarrhea,  drink  a  lot  of  water  or  other  fluids  to  avoid  dehydration  (loss  of
fluids).  Shigella  bacteria  cause  an  infection  called  shigellosis  that  can  spread  easily
from  one  person  to  another.  Languages  Language  Assistance  Languages   Language
