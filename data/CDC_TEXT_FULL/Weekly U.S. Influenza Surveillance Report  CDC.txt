Surveillance Methods | FluView Interactive: National, Regional, and State Data or Age
Data Four additional human infections with an influenza A(H5) virus were reported by
the  Colorado  Department  of  Public  Health  and  Environment.  Four  individuals  in
Colorado, all aged >18 years, have tested positive for influenza A(H5) virus infection.
All  four  individuals  had  performed  disposal  and  culling  operations  prior  to  symptom
onset at one of two Colorado poultry facilities where highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) A(H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13, was detected in poultry. All four
individuals reported their symptoms to the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment during regular active monitoring on the farm conducted by public health
staff. Specimens were collected from the individuals. Specimens were initially tested at
the Colorado State Public Health Laboratory using the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention  (CDC)  influenza  A(H5)  assay  before  being  sent  to  CDC  for  further  testing.
Specimens from all four individuals were positive for influenza A and A(H5) virus using
diagnostic  rRT-PCR  at  CDC.  Additional  analysis  including  genetic  sequencing  is
underway.  In  response  to  these  detections,  additional  case  investigations  and
surveillance  activities  are  being  conducted  by  public  health  officials,  including  the
collection of additional specimens from symptomatic individuals at these farms. Further
symptom  screening  will  also  continue.  A  total  of  14  people  have  tested  positive  for
influenza A(H5) virus in the United States since 2022. The first case occurred in April
2022  in  Colorado  in  an  individual  who  had  performed  poultry  culling.  The  next  four
cases occurred April-June 2024 in Texas (one case), Michigan (two cases), and Colorado
(one case) in individuals who worked with dairy cows, followed by nine cases in persons
associated with poultry disposal and culling operations in Colorado in July 2024. Interim

novel  influenza  A  viruses:  Surveillance  Methods   |   FluView  Interactive  CDC  performs
genetic  and  antigenic  characterization  of  U.S.  viruses  submitted  from  state  and  local
public  health  laboratories  according  to  the  Right  Size  Roadmap  submission  guidance.
These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses
are  to  the  reference  viruses  representing  viruses  contained  in  the  current  influenza
vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur
in  influenza  viruses  circulating  in  humans.  CDC  also  tests  susceptibility  of  circulating
influenza  viruses  to  antiviral  medications  including  the  neuraminidase  inhibitors
(oseltamivir,  zanamivir,  and  peramivir)  and  the  PA  endonuclease  inhibitor  baloxavir.
CDC  has  genetically  characterized  5,077  influenza  viruses  collected  since  October  1,
2023. CDC antigenically characterizes influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition
(HI)  (H1N1pdm09,  H3N2,  B/Victoria,  and  B/Yamagata  viruses)  or  neutralization-based
HINT  (H3N2  viruses)  using  antisera  that  ferrets  make  after  being  infected  with
reference viruses representing the 2023-2024 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell
or  recombinant-based  vaccine  viruses.  Antigenic  differences  between  viruses  are
determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference
viruses  recognize  the  circulating  viruses  that  have  been  grown  in  cell  culture.  Ferret
antisera  are  useful  because  antibodies  raised  against  a  particular  virus  can  often
recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses
with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to
4-fold  when  compared  to  the  reference  (vaccine)  virus.  In  HINT,  viruses  with  similar
antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal
to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the
genetic  changes  in  the  surface  proteins  seen  in  genetically  characterized  viruses.
Influenza  A  Viruses  Influenza  B  Viruses  Assessment  of  Virus  Susceptibility  to  Antiviral
Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications
including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the
PA  endonuclease  inhibitor  baloxavir  using  next  generation  sequence  analysis
supplemented  by  laboratory  assays.  Information  about  antiviral  susceptibility  test
methods  can  be  found  at  U.S.  Influenza  Surveillance:  Purpose  and  Methods  |  CDC.
Viruses  collected  in  the  U.S.  since  October  1,  2023,  were  tested  for  antiviral
susceptibility  as  follows:  Four  A(H1N1)pdm09  viruses  had  NA-H275Y  amino  acid
substitution and one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-H275Y/H, conferring highly reduced
inhibition  by  oseltamivir  and  peramivir.  One  (H1N1)pdm09  virus  had  NA-I223V  and
NA-S247N amino acid substitutions and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two
B  viruses  had  NA-A245G  amino  acid  substitution  and  showed  reduced  inhibition  by
peramivir.  One  B  virus  had  NA-D197N  amino  acid  substitution  and  showed  reduced
inhibition  by  zanamivir  and  peramivir.  One  B  virus  had  NA-H273Y  amino  acid
substitution and showed highly reduced inhibition by peramivir. One A(H3N2) virus had
PA-I38T  amino  acid  substitution  and  showed  reduced  susceptibility  to  baloxavir.  High
levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among
influenza  A(H1N1)pdm09  and  influenza  A(H3N2)  viruses  (the  adamantanes  are  not
effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment
and  prevention  of  influenza  A  virus  infection  is  not  recommended  and  data  from
adamantane  resistance  testing  are  not  presented.  The  U.S.  Outpatient  Influenza-like
Illness  Surveillance  Network  (ILINet)  monitors  outpatient  visits  for  respiratory  illness
referred  to  as  influenza-like  illness  [ILI  (fever  plus  cough  or  sore  throat)],  not
laboratory-confirmed influenza and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due
to infection with pathogens that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza
viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data,
including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain
a more complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory
virus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19, influenza, and
RSV activity on a website that is updated weekly. Information about other respiratory
virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance
System  (NREVSS)  website.  Nationally,  the  percentage  of  visits  for  respiratory  illness
that were reported through ILINet remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points)
compared to the previous week and is below the national baseline. All 10 regions are
below their region-specific baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and
the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location.   * Effective
October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer
includes  “without  a  known  cause  other  than  influenza.”   About  70%  of  ILINet
participants  provide  both  the  number  of  patient  visits  for  respiratory  illness  and  the
total  number  of  patient  visits  for  the  week  broken  out  by  age  group.  Data  from  this
subset  of  providers  are  used  to  calculate  the  percentages  of  patient  visits  for
respiratory illness by age group. The percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported
in ILINet decreased in the 0-4 years age group and remained stable for all other age
groups in Week 29 compared to Week 28.   View Chart Data | View Full Screen Data
collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI activity* by state/jurisdiction
and  Core  Based  Statistical  Areas  (CBSA).     *Data  collected  in  ILINet  may
disproportionally  represent  certain  populations  within  a  jurisdiction  or  CBSA,  and
therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of influenza activity for the entire
jurisdiction or CBSA. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently
by some health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with
data  presented  by  the  health  department  likely  being  the  more  complete.  Additional
