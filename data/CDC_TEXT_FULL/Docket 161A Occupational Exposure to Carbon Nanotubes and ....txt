Bulletin 65: Occupational Exposure to Carbon Nanotubes and Nanofibers, in April 2013.
The final document and the NIOSH responses to the peer and public/stakeholder review
comments are provided below. Previously, a public meeting was held in Cincinnati, Ohio
on February 3, 2011 to discuss the purpose and content of the draft document and to
give  the  public  an  opportunity  to  ask  questions  and  comment  on  the  document.  The
document contains an evaluation of the toxicological data associated with exposure to
carbon  nanotubes  and  nanofibers  and  provides  recommendations  for  minimizing
adverse  health  effects  to  exposed  workers  including  a  recommendation  for  an
occupational exposure limit. Information about the public meeting, the external review
draft document, and the peer reviewer, and public/stakeholder comments received are
also  provided  below.  Notice  of  availability  of  guidance  document;  78FR25454;  5/1/13
