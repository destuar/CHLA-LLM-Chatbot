This  Quick  Learn  Lesson  will  take  approximately  15  minutes  to  complete.  When  you
have  completed  this  lesson,  you  will  be  able  to  recognize  characteristics  of  the  four
biological  safety  levels.  Suppose  you  are  a  laboratory  microbiologist  working  with  a
potentially harmful microbe. Precautions must be taken in the laboratory to make sure
you  and  others  are  not  infected.  These  are  just  a  few  of  the  questions  that  can  be
answered through an understanding of biosafety and the four biosafety levels (BSLs).
Microbe Microbes are organisms, such as bacteria and viruses that are too small to be
seen by the naked eye. What is Biosafety? 
Biosafety is the application of safety precautions that reduce a laboratorianâ€™s
risk of exposure to a potentially infectious microbe and limit contamination of the work
environment and, ultimately, the community. What are Biosafety Levels (BSLs)?
There  are  four  biosafety  levels.  Each  level  has  specific  controls  for  containment  of
microbes and biological agents. The primary risks that determine levels of containment
are  infectivity,  severity  of  disease,  transmissibility,  and  the  nature  of  the  work
conducted. Origin of the microbe, or the agent in question, and the route of exposure
are also important. Each biosafety level has its own specific containment controls that
are  required  for  the  following:  Route  of  Exposure  Route  of  exposure  is  the  way  a
microbe gains access to a living organism. There are four main routes of exposure The
biosafety levels range from BSL-1 to BSL-4. Each biosafety level builds on the controls
of  the  level  before  it.  Every  microbiology  laboratory,  regardless  of  biosafety  level,
follows  standard  microbiological  practices.  You  will  learn  about  each  level  on  the
following screens.
 Standard  Microbiological  Practices  Standard  microbiological  practices  are  those
practices that are common to all laboratories. These practices may include If you work
in a lab that is designated a BSL-1, the microbes there are not known to consistently
cause disease in healthy adults and present minimal potential hazard to laboratorians
and the environment. An example of a microbe that is typically worked with at a BSL-1
is  a  nonpathogenic  strain  of  E.  coli.  Specific  considerations  for  a  BSL-1  laboratory
include  the  following:   Laboratory  practices  Safety  equipment  Facility  construction
Nonpathogenic A nonpathogenic microbe is one that is not capable of causing disease.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) 
Equipment worn to minimize exposure to a variety of hazards. Examples of PPE include
laboratory  coats,  gowns,  gloves,  eye  protection,  face  shields,  shoe  covers,  and
respirators. BSL-2 builds upon BSL-1.  If you work in a lab that is designated a BSL-2,
the microbes there pose moderate hazards to laboratorians and the environment.  The
microbes are typically indigenous and associated with diseases of varying severity. An
example  of  a  microbe  that  is  typically  worked  with  at  a  BSL-2  laboratory  is
Staphylococcus aureus. Indigenous Indigenous microbes are those that are commonly
found in the geographic region. In addition to BSL-1 considerations,  BSL-2 laboratories
have  the  following  containment  requirements:  Laboratory  practices  Safety  equipment
Facility construction Autoclave Equipment used to decontaminate biological hazardous
waste or to sterilize equipment and supplies by subjecting them to high pressure and
saturated  steam  Biological  Safety  Cabinet  (BSC)  A  ventilated  cabinet  designed  to
provide  personnel,  product,  and  environmental  protection  when  appropriate  practices
and procedures are followed Eyewash An apparatus used to physically wash the eyes if
they  are  contaminated  by  infectious  microbes,  foreign  materials,  or  other  substances
Face Shields A protective device commonly used to shield the wearer's face and eyes
from  hazards  such  as  the  splashing,  spraying,  or  splattering  of  potentially  harmful
infectious materials BSL-3 builds upon the containment requirements of BSL-2. If you
work in a lab that is designated BSL-3, the microbes there can be either indigenous or
exotic,  and  they  can  cause  serious  or  potentially  lethal  disease  through  respiratory
transmission. Respiratory transmission is the inhalation route of exposure. One example
of  a  microbe  that  is  typically  worked  with  in  a  BSL-3  laboratory  is  Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. In addition to BSL-2 considerations, 
BSL-3 laboratories have the following containment requirements: Laboratory practices
Safety  equipment  Facility  construction  Respirator  A  protective  device  that  covers  the
nose  and  mouth  or  the  entire  face  or  head.   Lab  respirators  filter  out  infectious  or
harmful  particles;  some  supply  the  wearer  with  HEPA-filtered  air.  Appropriate
respirators are chosen based on the type of work being performed. BSL-4 builds upon
the  containment  requirements  of  BSL-3  and  is  the  highest  level  of  biological  safety.
There are a small number of BSL-4 labs in the United States and around the world. The
microbes  in  a  BSL-4  lab  are  dangerous  and  exotic,  posing  a  high  risk  of
aerosol-transmitted infections. Infections caused by these microbes are frequently fatal
and without treatment or vaccines. Two examples of microbes worked with in a BSL-4
laboratory  include  Ebola  and  Marburg  viruses.  In  addition  to  BSL-3  considerations,  
BSL-4 laboratories have the following containment requirements: Laboratory practices
Safety equipment Facility construction Class III BSC A gas-tight sealed container that is
designed to allow for the manipulation of objects, hazardous substances, or infectious
disease agents. Class III BSCs have a HEPA filtered air supply and double HEPA filtered
exhaust.   They  provide  the  ultimate  protection  for  personnel,  product,  and  the
environment.
 Positive  Pressure  Protective  Suit  Highly  specialized,  totally  encapsulating  industrial
protection garments worn only within special biocontainment or maximum containment
(BSL-4) laboratory facilities. The positive pressure in the suit will force air to flow out if
the  suit  is  damaged.  Now  that  you  have  learned  about  the  four  biosafety  levels,  it's
