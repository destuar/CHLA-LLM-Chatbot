contaminated food or drink, the event is called a foodborne disease outbreak. The list
on  this  page  primarily  represents  multistate  foodborne  outbreak  investigations
involving Listeria in which CDC was the lead public health agency. CDCâ€™s online data
tool, NORS Dashboard, contains a more complete listing of Listeria outbreaks reported
to  CDC  since  1998.  Public  health  officials  investigate  outbreaks  to  control  them,  so
more  people  do  not  get  sick,  and  to  learn  how  to  prevent  similar  outbreaks  from
happening in the future.  Sign up for RSS Feed
