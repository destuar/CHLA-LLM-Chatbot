Abstract
Introduction: In January 2003, the Westchester County Department of Health (WCDH)
began conducting 
electronic  syndromic  surveillance  of  hospital  emergency  department  (ED)  chief
complaints.  Although  methods  for  data  collection  and  analysis  used  in  syndromic
surveillance have been described previously, minimal information exists regarding the
responses 
to and investigations of signals detected by such systems. This paper describes WCDH's
experience  in  responding  to  syndromic  surveillance  signals  during  the  first  9  months
after the system was implemented.
Objectives:  The  objectives  of  this  analysis  were  to  examine  WCDH's  responses  to
signals detected by the county's syndromic surveillance system. Specific goals were to
1) review the actual complaints reported by hospital EDs to determine 
whether  complaint  data  were  accurately  identified  and  classified  into  syndrome
categories, and provide feedback from this review to data collection and analysis staff
to refine text terms or filters used to identify and classify chief complaints; 2) 
develop  procedures  and  response  algorithms  for  investigating  signals;  3)  determine
whether signals correlated with 
reportable  communicable  diseases  or  other  incidents  of  public  health  significance
requiring investigation and intervention; and 4) quantify the staffing resources and time
required to investigate signals.
Methods:
 During
 January
 27--October
 31,
 2003,
 electronic
 files
 containing
chief-complaint data from seven of the 
county's  13  EDs  were  collected  daily.  Complaints  were  classified  into  syndrome
categories  and  analyzed  for  statistically  significant  increases.  A  line  listing  of  each
complaint comprising each signal detected was reviewed for exact complaint, number,
location, patient demographics, and requirement for hospital admission.
Results:  A  total  of  59  signals  were  detected  in  eight  syndrome  categories:
fever/influenza (11), respiratory (6), vomiting (11), gastrointestinal illness/diarrhea (8),
sepsis  (7),  rash  (7),  hemorrhagic  events  (3),  and  neurologic  (6).  Line-listing  review
indicated that complaints routinely were incorrectly identified and included in syndrome
categories and that as few as three 
complaints  could  produce  a  signal.  On  the  basis  of  hospital,  geographic,  age,  or  sex
clustering of complaints, whether the complaint indicated a reportable condition (e.g.,
meningitis) or potentially represented an unusual medical event, and whether rates of
hospital  admission  were  consistent  with  medical  conditions,  34  of  59  signals  were
determined to require further investigation 
(i.e., obtaining additional information from ED staff or medical providers). Investigation
did not identify any reportable communicable disease or other incidents of public health
significance that would have been missed by existing 
traditional  surveillance  systems.  Nine  staff  members  spent  3  hours/week  collectively
investigating signals detected by syndromic surveillance. 
Conclusions: Standardized sets of text terms used to identify and classify hospital ED
chief complaints into 
syndrome categories might require modification on the basis of hospital idiosyncrasies
in recording chief complaints. Signal 
investigations  could  be  reasonably  conducted  by  using  local  health  department
resources.  Although  no  communicable  disease  events  were  identified,  the  system
provided  baseline  and  timely  objective  data  for  hospital  visits  and  improved
communication 
among county health department and hospital ED staff.
Introduction
Westchester  County  (2000  population:  923,459)  is  located  directly  north  of  New  York
City  and  is  served  by  13  acute-care  hospitals  with  emergency  departments  (EDs).
Existing communicable disease surveillance systems include passive 
surveillance  based  on  notification  by  physicians  or  laboratories  of  reportable
communicable diseases and reports from schools and health-care facilities. WCDH has
routinely  conducted  active  surveillance  for  specific  diseases  or  situations  (e.g.,
telephoning hospitals to identify possible cases of West Nile virus after the advent of
this disease in 1999). Increasing concern about 
potential  incidents  of  biologic  terrorism  has  highlighted  the  need  for  surveillance
systems to permit the earliest possible detection of such an incident. Efforts to develop
an electronic syndromic surveillance system in Westchester County were initiated 
before  the  September  11,  2001,  terrorist  attacks;  the  system  was  implemented  in
January  2003.  Although  methods  for  data  collection  and  analysis  used  in  syndromic
surveillance systems have been described 
previously (1,2), minimal information exists 
about  the  responses  to  and  investigations  of  signals  detected  by  such  surveillance
systems.  This  paper  describes  responses  by  WCDH  disease  investigative  staff  to
syndromic  surveillance  signals.  The  data  collection  and  analysis  methods  used  have
been described previously (1,3).
Westchester County's Syndromic Surveillance System
On  the  basis  of  similar  systems  developed  and  implemented  by  other  local  health
departments 
(2,4), WCDH implemented an electronic syndromic surveillance system in January 2003
in  four  of  the  county's  13  hospital  EDs.  By  October  2003,  the  system  had  been
expanded to include seven hospitals. Data from the seven EDs captured approximately
600 daily ED 
visits,  which  represented  approximately  70%  of  total  daily  ED  visits  to  all  13  county
hospitals. Data collected on 
each  patient  included  the  chief  complaint  for  which  the  patient  was  seeking  medical
attention, hospital name, patient age, 
sex, medical record number, municipality and zip code of residence, ED visit date, and
whether the patient was 
subsequently 
discharged from the ED or admitted to the hospital. On the basis of text search terms
and syndrome categories developed 
by other local health departments and CDC 
(5), chief complaints were classified into eight syndrome categories: 
1)  fever/influenza  in  patients  aged  >13  years,  2)  respiratory  complaints  in  patients
aged >13 years, 3) vomiting, 4) 
gastrointestinal  illness/diarrhea,  5)  sepsis,  6)  rash,  7)  hemorrhagic  events,  and  8)
neurologic events.
For each syndrome category, the number of complaints or visits for each category was
analyzed to identify any 
statistically significant increases in visits. The 
cumulative sum method (CUSUM) was used for statistical analysis 
(1); three possible signal types (C1, C2, or C3) could be generated for each of the eight
syndrome categories 
(3).  A  C1  signal  was  generated  when  the  number  of  visits  from  the  previous  day
exceeded the mean number of visits for the previous 7 days by 3 standard deviations. A
C2 signal was generated when the number of visits from the previous day exceeded the
mean number of visits for the 7 
days beginning 9 days before the day being analyzed (excluding the mean number of
visits for the 2 days immediately preceding 
the day being analyzed to smooth the data from any recent aberrations) by 3 standard
deviations.  A  C3  signal  was  generated  when  an  increase  in  the  number  of  visits/day
occurred on >1 of the 3 preceding consecutive days 
(1, L. Hutwagner, M.S., CDC, personal communication, 2004). Each time a signal was 
detected, WCDH disease investigative staff were notified 
and provided with a line listing of complaints comprising the signal and containing the
data elements listed previously. 
Objectives
The objective of this analysis was to examine WCDH's 
responses to signals detected by a syndromic surveillance 
system. Specific goals were as follows:
review the actual complaints submitted by reporting hospital EDs to determine whether
complaints were 
accurately identified and classified into syndrome categories;
provide  feedback  from  this  review  to  data  collection  and  analysis  staff  to  refine  text
terms or filters used to identify and classify chief complaints into syndrome categories;
develop procedures and response algorithms for investigating signals;
determine  whether  signals  correlated  with  reportable  communicable  disease  or  other
incidents of public health significance requiring investigation and intervention; and
quantify the staffing resources and time required to 
investigate signals.

Introduction
 Westchester County (2000 population: 923,459) is located directly north of New York
City  and  is  served  by  13  acute-care  hospitals  with  emergency  departments  (EDs).
Existing communicable disease surveillance systems include passive 
surveillance  based  on  notification  by  physicians  or  laboratories  of  reportable
communicable diseases and reports from schools and health-care facilities. WCDH has
routinely  conducted  active  surveillance  for  specific  diseases  or  situations  (e.g.,
telephoning hospitals to identify possible cases of West Nile virus after the advent of
this disease in 1999). Increasing concern about 
potential  incidents  of  biologic  terrorism  has  highlighted  the  need  for  surveillance
systems to permit the earliest possible detection of such an incident. Efforts to develop
an electronic syndromic surveillance system in Westchester County were initiated 
before  the  September  11,  2001,  terrorist  attacks;  the  system  was  implemented  in
January  2003.  Although  methods  for  data  collection  and  analysis  used  in  syndromic
surveillance systems have been described 
previously (1,2), minimal information exists 
about  the  responses  to  and  investigations  of  signals  detected  by  such  surveillance
systems.  This  paper  describes  responses  by  WCDH  disease  investigative  staff  to
syndromic  surveillance  signals.  The  data  collection  and  analysis  methods  used  have
been described previously (1,3).
Westchester County's Syndromic Surveillance System
 On  the  basis  of  similar  systems  developed  and  implemented  by  other  local  health
departments 
(2,4), WCDH implemented an electronic syndromic surveillance system in January 2003
in  four  of  the  county's  13  hospital  EDs.  By  October  2003,  the  system  had  been
expanded to include seven hospitals. Data from the seven EDs captured approximately
600 daily ED 
visits,  which  represented  approximately  70%  of  total  daily  ED  visits  to  all  13  county
hospitals. Data collected on 
each  patient  included  the  chief  complaint  for  which  the  patient  was  seeking  medical
attention, hospital name, patient age, 
sex, medical record number, municipality and zip code of residence, ED visit date, and
whether the patient was 
subsequently 
discharged from the ED or admitted to the hospital. On the basis of text search terms
and syndrome categories developed 
by other local health departments and CDC 
(5), chief complaints were classified into eight syndrome categories: 
1)  fever/influenza  in  patients  aged  >13  years,  2)  respiratory  complaints  in  patients
aged >13 years, 3) vomiting, 4) 
gastrointestinal  illness/diarrhea,  5)  sepsis,  6)  rash,  7)  hemorrhagic  events,  and  8)
neurologic events.
 For each syndrome category, the number of complaints or visits for each category was
analyzed to identify any 
statistically significant increases in visits. The 
cumulative sum method (CUSUM) was used for statistical analysis 
(1); three possible signal types (C1, C2, or C3) could be generated for each of the eight
syndrome categories 
(3).  A  C1  signal  was  generated  when  the  number  of  visits  from  the  previous  day
exceeded the mean number of visits for the previous 7 days by 3 standard deviations. A
C2 signal was generated when the number of visits from the previous day exceeded the
mean number of visits for the 7 
days beginning 9 days before the day being analyzed (excluding the mean number of
visits for the 2 days immediately preceding 
the day being analyzed to smooth the data from any recent aberrations) by 3 standard
deviations.  A  C3  signal  was  generated  when  an  increase  in  the  number  of  visits/day
occurred on >1 of the 3 preceding consecutive days 
(1, L. Hutwagner, M.S., CDC, personal communication, 2004). Each time a signal was 
detected, WCDH disease investigative staff were notified 
and provided with a line listing of complaints comprising the signal and containing the
data elements listed previously. 
Objectives
 The objective of this analysis was to examine WCDH's 
responses to signals detected by a syndromic surveillance 
system. Specific goals were as follows:
 During January 27--October 31, 2003, electronic files containing chief-complaint data
from participating hospital 
EDs were collected daily (four EDs in January, expanding to six EDs in April and seven in
July). On eight occasions, data 
transfers were not received from the hospitals but were transmitted the following day,
and analyses were performed 
retrospectively. During the 277-day study period, 59 statistically significant increases or
signals were detected on 57 separate days (two signals occurred on 2 days) in eight
different syndrome categories (Table). The number of complaints or visits required to
produce 
a  signal  varied  by  syndrome  category.  For  the  sepsis  and  neurologic  categories,  the
number of complaints required to generate a signal ranged from three to 10. For other
syndrome  categories  (e.g.,  gastrointestinal  illness/diarrhea  and  fever/influenza),  the
number of complaints 
required to generate a signal ranged from 12 to 20.
 Each  time  a  C1,  C2,  or  C3  signal  was  generated  in  any  of  the  eight  syndrome
categories, disease-investigation staff (including an infectious-diseases physician and a
nonphysician epidemiologist) reviewed a line listing of the 
individual  complaints  comprising  the  signal.  This  line  listing  contained  the  absolute
number  of  visits  comprising  the  signal,  the  chief-complaint  text  for  which  the  patient
was seeking medical 
attention, hospital name, patient age, sex, municipality and zip 
code of residence, ED visit date, and whether the patient was subsequently discharged
from the ED or admitted to the 
hospital.  The  number  of  complaints  resulting  in  a  signal  and  thus  contained  in  line
listings varied by 
syndrome (range: 3--103).
Terms Used To Identify and Classify Complaints into Syndrome Categories
 By using a system developed by the New York City Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene 
(2,4),  WCDH  staff  collected  data  files  from  hospital  EDs  containing  fields  of  free  text
describing  the  patient's  chief  complaint.  These  text  fields  were  searched  for  specific
terms that were then used to classify complaints by syndrome category. For example,
terms used 
to identify and classify ED visits into a fever/influenza syndrome category included 
fever, temp, hot, and 
aches,  among  others.  Specific  terms  were  also  designated  for  exclusion  from  a
syndrome  category  (e.g.,  chief  complaints  of  nausea  or  vomiting  including  the  terms
pregnant or 
pregnancy were excluded from the vomiting syndrome category).
 An  infectious-diseases  physician  and  a  nonphysician  epidemiologist  compared  text
terms used to identify and 
classify complaints into syndrome categories with the actual text submitted by hospital
EDs. Although they were not 
systematically quantified, the majority of terms used to identify and classify complaints
into syndrome categories and terms used to 
exclude  complaints  from  syndrome  categories  were  determined  to  be  correct.  For
example, the terms 
temp  and  hot  correctly  identified  and  classified  the  majority  of  complaints  into  a
fever/influenza syndrome category, but such terms as attempted suicide and gunshot
were  also  identified  and  included  in  the  complaints  for  a  fever/influenza  syndrome
category because they each contain the text of interest (temp and 
hot) within the larger text. Detection of the first 10--15 signals and subsequent 
line-listing reviews of complaints comprising these signals indicated that 
<3 complaints could result in a signal (C1 or C2, as 
described  previously)  for  certain  syndrome  categories,  meaning  that  incorrect
identification of a limited number of complaints 
could  result  in  a  false-positive  signal  and  trigger  additional  investigation.  During
reviews  of  line  listings  comprising  signals,  at  least  one  term  that  could  result  in  a
complaint  being  classified  incorrectly  into  one  of  the  syndrome  categories  was
identified 
in every line listing. Whenever this occurred, the data collection and analysis staff were
instructed  to  exclude  such  terms  to  prevent  future  false-positive  signals.  Line-listing
reviews also indicated that certain EDs recorded chief complaints 
by specifying complaints that patients did 
not have (e.g., denies shortness of 
breath or denies fever). As a result, certain 
chief-complaint  terms  detected  by  the  system  did  not  represent  true  cases  of  a
particular  syndrome.  With  repeated  reviews,  the  number  of  complaints  incorrectly
identified or classified into syndrome categories decreased. On the basis of this limited
experience,  a  standard  set  of  text  terms  might  not  be  universally  applicable  for
syndromic surveillance systems but 
might require modifications based on idiosyncrasies in the text or words used to record
chief complaints by individual hospital ED staff.
Investigation of Detected Signals
 An algorithm was developed for responding to different types of signals detected by
the syndromic surveillance 
system  (Figure).  In  addition  to  determining  whether  patient  visits  might  have  been
incorrectly included in a syndrome category in response to a C1, C2, or C3 signal, an
infectious-diseases physician and a nonphysician epidemiologist reviewed the 
line  listing  of  complaints  comprising  a  signal  to  determine  the  need  for  additional
investigation  based  on  any  clustering  by  hospital,  patient  municipality  or  zip  code  of
residence, age, or sex, or whether the specific nature of a complaint was reportable in
New York State. The complaints comprising a signal 
occurred in at least two to three hospitals and municipalities; in 
no instances did all of the complaints originate from a single hospital or municipality. To
determine the need for 
further investigation, staff also assessed complaints for their potential to represent an
unusual medical event and examined whether hospital-admission rates were consistent
with the medical condition. For example, urosepsis in an elderly resident of a nursing
home would be less an indication for further investigation than altered mental status in
a young adult requiring hospital admission. Similarly, the percentage of visits requiring
hospital admission varied depending on the complaint and 
the absolute number of visits. Hospital-admission rates not consistent with the medical
condition were also an indication 
for further investigation. For example, three or four complaints or ED visits for seizures
requiring hospital admission would be less of an indication for further investigation than
70--80  visits  for  diarrhea,  of  which  25%  required  hospital  admission.  No  standard
threshold percentage of visits requiring hospital admission could be used to determine
the need for 
additional investigation; review and clinical judgment were 
required to make this assessment.
 If  the  line-listing  review  identified  no  obvious  cases  or  clusters  of  concern  or  cases
potentially  representing  a  reportable  or  unusual  medical  event,  disease-investigation
staff awaited results of the next day's data analysis to determine whether the 
signal was sustained and whether investigation was needed. If any cases or clustering
of concern were noted, disease investigative staff obtained further information. On the
basis of the line-listing review, 29 of the 56 C1 or C2 signals detected by 
syndromic 
surveillance  required  further  investigation.  All  C3  signals  were  investigated  further.
Follow-up investigation was conducted 
by telephone calls to hospital ED physicians, 
infection-control practitioners, or treating physicians and by requesting facsimiles 
of relevant laboratory and diagnostic tests results or medical records. The information
obtained was sufficient to assess 
each situation, and no on-site hospital ED visits or chart reviews were conducted.
 Because  increases  in  ED  visits  in  a  given  syndrome  category  on  a  single  day  could
result in a C1 or C2 signal but 
an increase in ED visits in a given syndrome category on >1 of 3 consecutive days was
required to generate a C3 signal, a 
C3  signal  was  believed  to  have  an  increased  potential  for  an  event  of  concern.
Therefore, in response to the three C3 
signals  detected,  all  the  investigative  procedures  described  previously  were  followed,
but further investigation was conducted regardless of the results of the line-listing 
review. WCDH staff contacted ED and infection-control staff at all 13 hospitals 
to notify them that the syndromic surveillance system had 
detected an increase in a particular syndrome (e.g., 
gastrointestinal illness/diarrhea) and to ask whether any 
increase in the syndrome of interest had been noted during or since the 
time  encompassed  by  the  most  recent  complaint  data  submitted,  or  whether  any
concern existed. If hospital ED or 
infection-control  staff  perceived  no  increases  and  expressed  no  concern,  they  were
asked to report any perceived increase in ED visits for the syndrome of concern for the
current day, and results of data analysis of complaints for the subsequent day were 
reviewed.  Hospital  staff  perceived  no  increases  or  need  for  concern  after  any  of  the
three  C3  signals.  Had  such  increases  or  concern  been  perceived,  data  collection  and
analysis staff were instructed to request, from all hospital EDs participating in 
syndromic  surveillance,  electronic  files  containing  chief-complaint  data  encompassing
the 12 hours subsequent to the last routine file transfer. None of the three C3 signals
warranted 
this level of response. 
Correlation of Signals with Reportable Communicable Disease or Other 
Incidents of Public Health Significance
 After  the  response  and  investigation  of  syndromic  surveillance  signals,  no  events  of
concern or that were detected 
through  other  existing  surveillance  mechanisms  were  identified.  On  one  occasion  a
complaint of encephalitis and on 11 
occasions  complaints  of  meningitis  were  noted  on  line  listings  comprising  a  signal.
Because  all  types  of  meningitis  and  encephalitis  are  notifiable  diseases  in  New  York
State and cases of meningococcal meningitis usually require intervention (e.g., 
postexposure prophylaxis of contacts), these cases were investigated by contacting the
treating  physician  or  hospital  staff.  In  all  cases,  patients  had  received  alternate
diagnoses.  Because  line  listings  were  reviewed  only  when  a  signal  was  detected,
persons 
with meningitis might have reported to EDs on days on which no signal was detected
and therefore would not have been detected through this mechanism. Although other
clusters  or  reportable  events  were  detected  through  telephone  calls  from  medical
providers or affected facilities during the 
9-month period, the affected hospitals were not participating in 
syndromic surveillance, making correlation impossible. No cases of meningitis or other
reportable diseases or events that had not 
been detected through otherwise existing surveillance mechanisms (typically telephone
notification from hospital ED 
staff,  infection-control  staff,  or  treating  physician,  or  by  a  New  York  State  electronic
laboratory reporting system) were detected through syndromic surveillance.
Efforts Required for Signal Follow-Up
 Nine disease-investigation staff members spent a portion of their time responding to
syndromic surveillance signals. 
An  infectious-disease  physician  and  a  communicable-disease  epidemiologist  routinely
reviewed  the  line  listings,  and  seven  public  health  nurses  participated  in  follow-up
investigations as described previously. The time and effort required for these activities
varied depending on the number of signals received on a given day (1--2 signals/day)
and the number of complaints on 
the  line  listing  for  each  signal  requiring  additional  investigation  (range:  1--10
complaints/signal). Staff were asked to track for 1 month the time spent on follow-up.
Signal and line-listing reviews typically required approximately 15 minutes and 
were  performed  by  a  physician  and  an  epidemiologist.  Telephone  calls  to  medical
providers and reviews of medical records received by facsimile for a single complaint
typically  required  30  minutes,  including  the  time  needed  to  reach  and  speak  with  a
knowledgeable hospital staff member or for such staff to obtain relevant information.
On average, disease-investigation staff collectively spent approximately 3 hours/week
to  investigate  signals  generated  by  the  syndromic  surveillance  system,  not  including
time required by data collection and analysis staff 
(3). Because information obtained through telephone calls 
and 
review  of  faxed  medical  records  was  sufficient  to  assess  each  of  these  situations,  no
on-site hospital ED visits or chart reviews were necessary.
Discussion and Conclusions 
  The information presented in this paper is primarily 
descriptive and encompasses only 9 months, during which time 
only  four  to  seven  of  13  hospital  EDs  in  the  county  participated  in  syndromic
surveillance. Despite these limitations, the research identified areas that might benefit
from  further  evaluation,  and  Westchester  County's  experiences  might  be  useful  for
others implementing syndromic surveillance.
 Complaints identified by text terms developed for use in syndromic surveillance 
(5) routinely were incorrectly identified 
and classified into syndrome categories of interest. Standardized text terms to identify
and classify hospital ED chief 
complaints into syndrome categories might not be broadly applicable but might require
modification  because  of  hospital  idiosyncrasies  in  recording  chief  complaints.
Assessment  of  signals  by  medical  or  clinical  professionals  was  required  to  determine
the need 
for further investigation.
 The procedures used to assess and investigate syndromic surveillance signals could be
reasonably conducted by using 
the  resources  of  a  local  health  department.  No  reportable  or  other  disease  events  or
events that required further investigation 
or intervention in addition to those detected by existing traditional surveillance systems
were identified through the 
59  syndromic  surveillance  signals  detected  and  investigated  during  this  9-month
period. Because 
<3  complaints  were  required  to  generate  a  signal,  a  limited  number  of  incorrectly
identified complaints could result in a signal and trigger additional investigation.
 Further  evaluation  is  required  to  establish  the  conditions  in  which  syndromic
surveillance is most useful. A jurisdiction 
of  the  size  and  complexity  served  by  WCDH  might  represent  the  smaller  end  of  the
spectrum in which such systems are likely 
to be useful, and the disease events that occurred were not the type of events intended
to be detected by syndromic surveillance.  Finally, the implementation of this system
and investigation of detected signals provided additional 
benefits. Communications, working relationships, and personal familiarity among WCDH
and hospital ED staff improved. ED 
staff  awareness  that  WCDH  staff  were  available  24  hours/day,  7  days/week  as  a
resource increased. Physicians and hospital staff expressed appreciation for feedback
provided by WCDH 
regarding potential disease activity of concern. A substantial 
number  of  the  reportable  or  unusual  events  that  occurred  during  the  9-month  study
period were detected through telephone calls from ED staff. This fact underscores the
importance to disease surveillance of communication with local ED staff and indicates
that  syndromic  surveillance  should  complement  and  not  replace  traditional  reporting
and surveillance systems. The 
system provided baseline and timely objective data for hospital visits and might provide
a basis for future monitoring of other conditions of interest.
