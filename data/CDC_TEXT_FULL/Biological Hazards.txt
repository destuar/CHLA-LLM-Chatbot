that  can  be  transmitted  to  individuals  through  various  routes  of  exposure  (modes  of
transmission).  Exposure  to  these  hazards  may  result  in  acute  or  chronic  health
conditions. Examples of Pathogens and Common Modes of Transmission  The modes of
transmission  depend  on  where  the  microbe  resides  (the  source/reservoir)  and  how  it
exits  the  source/reservoir  (Association  for  Professionals  in  Infection  Control,  2016;
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006/2012). Components to the mode of
transmission are called the chain of infection.
