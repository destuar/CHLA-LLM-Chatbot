Workbook  to  help  healthcare  facilities  prevent  needlesticks  and  other  sharps-related
injuries to healthcare personnel.  Occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens from
needlesticks and other sharps injuries is a serious problem, resulting in approximately
385,000  needlesticks  and  other  sharps-related  injuries  to  hospital-based  healthcare
personnel each year. Similar injuries occur in other healthcare settings, such as nursing
homes,  clinics,  emergency  care  services,  and  private  homes.  Sharps  injuries  are
primarily associated with occupational transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis
C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but they have been implicated
in  the  transmission  of  more  than  20  other  pathogens.   CDC  provides  information  on
infection  control  and  clinical  safety  to  help  reduce  the  risk  of  infections  among
healthcare workers, patients, and visitors. Languages Language Assistance Languages
