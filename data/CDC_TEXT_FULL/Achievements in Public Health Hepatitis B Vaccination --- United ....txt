and  the  title  of  the  report  in  the  subject  line  of  e-mail.  This  year  marks  the  20th
anniversary of the implementation in the United States of the world's first vaccine 
against hepatitis B virus (HBV). In addition to acute disease, persons infected with HBV
are at risk for chronic HBV infection 
and severe morbidity and mortality from cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Before
1982, an estimated 
200,000--300,000  persons  in  the  United  States  were  infected  annually  with  HBV,
including approximately 20,000 children 
(1).  No  practical  method  of  pre-exposure  prophylaxis  for  HBV  existed,  and  the  only
postexposure prophylaxis available was injection 
with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). 
 Since 1982, substantial progress has been made toward eliminating HBV transmission
in children and reducing the risk 
for  HBV  infection  in  adults.  During  1982--2002,  an  estimated  40  million  infants  and
children and 30 million adults 
received  hepatitis  B  vaccine.  Because  of  vaccination  and  changes  in  risk-reduction
behaviors among at-risk populations in response 
to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the number of persons infected in the United States declined
to an estimated 79,000 in 2001. 
To 
eliminate  HBV  transmission,  high  vaccine-coverage  rates  must  be  sustained  among
infants, children, and adolescents, 
and programs to vaccinate adults at high risk for HBV infection must be expanded. 
Evolving Vaccination Strategy 
In June 1982, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) published the
first official recommendations 
on the use of hepatitis B vaccine (Table) 
(2). ACIP recommended pre-exposure vaccination initially for groups with a high 
risk  for  HBV  infection.*  However,  by  1989,  it  had  become  evident  that  members  of
these groups (e.g., men who have sex 
with  men  [MSM],  injection-drug  users  [IDUs],  and  heterosexual  persons  with  multiple
partners) were not being vaccinated 
in substantial numbers. Some persons did not recognize the risk for HBV infection, and
others did not know about the 
vaccine or were unable to purchase it. In addition, health-care providers often did not
identify candidates for vaccination 
(CDC,  unpublished  data,  1987).  Health-care  workers  comprised  80%  of  the
approximately 2.5 million 
persons  vaccinated  during  the  1980s;  however,  only  5%  of  acute  hepatitis  B  cases
occurred among health-care workers 
(3).
In  1991,  recognizing  the  difficulty  of  vaccinating  high-risk  adults  and  the  substantial
burden of HBV-related 
disease  acquired  from  infections  in  childhood,  ACIP  recommended  a  comprehensive
strategy to eliminate HBV transmission in 
the  United  States  (4).  The  strategy  focused  on  universal  childhood  vaccination,
prevention of perinatal HBV 
transmission,  vaccination  of  adolescents  and  adults  in  high-risk  groups,  and  catch-up
vaccinations for susceptible children in 
high-risk  populations.  In  1995,  ACIP  recommended  the  routine  vaccination  of  all
adolescents aged 11--12 years who had not 
been vaccinated previously (5), and in 1999, ACIP recommended that all unvaccinated
children aged <19 years be vaccinated 
(6).  The  ACIP  vaccination  strategies  for  children  and  adolescents  have  been
implemented successfully in the United States, 
and  hepatitis  B  vaccine  is  now  considered  part  of  the  routine  childhood  vaccination
schedule. During 1993--2000, the 
national  coverage  rate  for  hepatitis  B  vaccine  among  children  aged  19--35  months
increased from 16% to 90%, and the coverage 
rate for U.S. adolescents aged 13--15 years increased from near zero to 67%.
Part of the success of these strategies can be attributed to the availability of expanded
funding for childhood 
vaccinations  and  to  laws  requiring  vaccination  of  school  children.  In  1994,  Congress
enacted Vaccines for Children, a national program 
to  purchase  ACIP-recommended  vaccines  for  eligible  children  aged  <19  years.  Laws
have been enacted in 44 states 
mandating  hepatitis  B  vaccination  for  children  entering  elementary  schools  and
childcare centers and in 34 states requiring 
vaccination for adolescents in middle school 
(7).
Substantial declines in the incidence of acute hepatitis B have occurred among highly
vaccinated populations, such as 
young children and health-care workers. During 1986--2000, the rate of acute hepatitis
B among children aged 1--9 years 
declined  >80%  (Figure).  During  1983--1995,  the  rate  of  HBV  infection  in  health-care
workers declined 95% and is now lower 
than the rate for the general U.S. population 
(8).
Since  hepatitis  B  vaccination  began  in  1982,  the  prevalence  of  chronic  HBV  infection
has been reduced substantially 
among populations whose infection rates previously were high. For example, in 1994,
the prevalence of chronic HBV 
infection  among  Alaska  Natives  aged  <10  years  (i.e.,  children  born  after  routine
vaccination began) was zero, compared with 
16% among Alaska Natives aged 11--30 years 
(9).
Preventing Perinatal HBV Transmission
Since 1982, the control of perinatal infection has been a crucial part of ACIP's evolving
HBV vaccination strategy. In 
1984, ACIP recommended hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening for pregnant
women in groups at high risk for 
acquiring HBV infection and postexposure immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine
and HBIG for all infants born to 
HBsAg-positive  mothers  (10).  However,  within  a  few  years,  studies  showed  that
screening women in high-risk groups failed 
to identify 35%--65% of HBsAg-positive pregnant women 
(11,12). Consequently, in 1988, ACIP recommended that 
all pregnant women be screened routinely for HBsAg 
(13). 
In  1990,  the  federal  government  began  funding  perinatal  hepatitis  B  prevention
programs to promote prenatal screening 
of  all  pregnant  women  for  HBsAg  and  tracking  of  infants  born  to  HBsAg-positive
mothers to ensure that the infants 
receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. These programs have been implemented
successfully. A survey of birthing 
hospitals conducted in 2000 in 14 states showed that 96.5% of pregnant women had
been screened for HBsAg (CDC, 
unpublished data, 2000). During 2000, state health departments identified and tracked
10,192 infants born to HBsAg-positive 
mothers  (CDC,  unpublished  data,  2000).  Of  these  infants,  90%  received  hepatitis  B
vaccine and HBIG before hospital discharge. 
At 
age 6--8 months, 71% of these infants had completed the 3-dose hepatitis B vaccine
series. On the basis of these 
coverage  rates,  CDC  estimates  that  perinatal  HBV  infection  in  the  United  States
declined 75% during 1987--2000 
(CDC, unpublished data, 2000).
Implementation Challenges
Since  its  inception  in  1982,  the  U.S.  hepatitis  B  vaccination  effort  has  faced  several
challenges. In the mid-1980s, 
concern was expressed about the possible risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
transmission by the original 
plasma-derived  vaccine;  however,  no  transmission  of  any  microbial  agent  was
demonstrated, and the safety of the vaccine was reaffirmed 
(14). Plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccines are no longer used in the United States, but
their use continues safely in other 
countries.  The  vaccines  currently  available  in  the  United  States  are  produced  by
recombinant DNA technology.
In  1991,  some  pediatric-care  providers  were  reluctant  to  accept  the  ACIP
recommendation that all U.S. infants 
be vaccinated. However, by 1996, comprehensive efforts to educate 
providers and parents about hepatitis B and the benefit 
of vaccination had resulted in broad acceptance of the vaccine 
(15).
In  June  1999,  concerns  were  expressed  about  the  risk  to  young  children  of  mercury
exposure from thimerosal, a 
preservative used in childhood vaccines, including hepatitis B vaccine. As a precaution,
the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), 
the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics  (AAP),  and  the  American  Academy  of  Family
Physicians (AAFP) recommended 
postponing  the  first  dose  of  hepatitis  B  vaccine  from  birth  until  age  2--6  months  for
infants born to HBsAg-negative mothers. 
These  groups  also  recommended  eliminating  thimerosal  from  childhood  vaccines  as
soon as possible. By 2000, the two 
companies  that  manufacture  hepatitis  B  vaccine  in  the  United  States  had  eliminated
thimerosal as a preservative from these vaccines, 
and  PHS,  AAP,  and  AAFP  urged  the  resumption  of  hepatitis  B  vaccination  at  birth.
However, the temporary postponement 
of  hepatitis  B  vaccine  at  birth  resulted  in  the  failure  of  some  hospitals  to  immunize
high-risk infants appropriately. This 
situation  persisted  after  vaccines  that  do  not  contain  thimerosal  as  a  preservative
became available 
(16).
Although  concerns  have  been  expressed  over  the  past  20  years  that  certain  chronic
illnesses might be caused by hepatitis 
B vaccine, no evidence exists that any of these diseases is caused by the vaccine. For
example, in the mid-1990s, concerns 
were expressed that the vaccine might cause multiple sclerosis. However, a report by
the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found 
no evidence of a causal relation between hepatitis B vaccination in adults and multiple
sclerosis 
(17).  The  vaccine  continues  to  be  considered  safe  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug
Administration, ACIP, IOM, and other national professional vaccination 
advisory groups.
Challenges for the 21st Century
Despite  progress  in  vaccinating  children  and  adults  in  some  occupational  and
racial/ethnic groups, approximately 
1.2 million persons in the United States have chronic HBV infection, and an estimated
4,000--5,000 persons die each year 
from HBV-related liver diseases. The goal of eliminating HBV transmission in the United
States can be achieved only by 
sustaining  a  high  level  of  immunity  against  HBV  infection  in  all  age  groups.  The
prospect for achieving immunity in children is 
already within reach; 90% of U.S. children aged 2 years receive 3 doses of hepatitis B
vaccine, a coverage rate that 
meets  national  health  goals.  To  maintain  high  hepatitis  B  vaccine  coverage,  public
health professionals must ensure that the safety of hepatitis 
B vaccine is monitored appropriately through credible scientific studies that assure 
the public that vaccines are safe. 
Two  important  challenges  for  health  departments  and  health-care  providers  are
maintaining high screening rates 
among pregnant women for HBsAg and ensuring that newborn infants receive proper
immunoprophylaxis. Although high 
screening rates have been achieved among pregnant women, current efforts to identify
and track infants born to 
HBsAg-positive  mothers  are  inadequate.  Advances  in  the  prevention  of  perinatal  HBV
transmission will depend on improved 
health  department  identification,  tracking,  and  case  management  of  infants  born  to
HBsAg-positive mothers 
(18).
Routine vaccination of adolescents must be increased and aggressive efforts made to
vaccinate adults at high risk for 
HBV  infection.  Adolescent  vaccination  will  remain  an  important  goal  for  the  next
decade, until the cohort of vaccinated 
infants  reaches  adolescence.  State  laws  mandating  hepatitis  B  vaccination  for
middle-school children are effective in achieving 
high  coverage  rates  (7).  Adoption  of  these  laws  by  more  states  will  increase  the
adolescent vaccination rate. 
The  greatest  remaining  challenge  for  hepatitis  B  prevention  is  the  vaccination  of
high-risk adults. The rate of hepatitis 
B  vaccination  in  this  group  has  remained  low,  in  part  because  of  the  difficulty  in
identifying candidates for vaccination 
before  they  become  infected  and  limited  public  funding  for  adult  vaccination.  In
serosurveys of MSM aged 15--22 years recruited 
at 
public  venues  in  seven  U.S.  metropolitan  areas  during  1994--1998,  only  9%  had
serologic evidence of hepatitis B 
vaccination  (19).  Among  IDUs  attending  sexually  transmitted  disease  (STD)  clinics  in
San Diego from 1998--2001, only 6% 
reported previous hepatitis B vaccination (CDC, unpublished data, 2002).
The  national  health  objectives  for  2010  call  for  a  reduction  of  75%--90%  in  acute
hepatitis B cases among high-risk 
adults (20). To achieve this goal, adults with behavioral risk factors for HBV infection
must be identified and vaccinated. 
Many
 opportunities
 to
 vaccinate
 high-risk
 adults
 are
 missed.
 For
 example,
approximately 56% of adults with acute hepatitis B 
have received care previously in correctional facilities or STD treatment clinics, where
vaccination could have been offered 
(21).  The  most  effective  approach  to  vaccinating  high-risk  adults  is  to  integrate
hepatitis B vaccination into programs that 
provide  services  to  persons  with  risk  factors  for  HBV  infection  (e.g.,  STD  clinics,  HIV
counseling and testing sites, 
correctional facilities, and drug treatment clinics). CDC is working with state and local
public health departments to 
integrate  comprehensive  hepatitis  prevention  measures,  including  hepatitis  B
vaccination, into programs providing services to 
persons at risk for HBV infection. In addition, CDC has funded cooperative agreements
at 18 sites around the country to identify 
the  most  effective  approaches  to  achieve  integration  of  hepatitis  B  vaccination  into
these programs.
Sustaining  high  vaccine-coverage  rates  among  infants,  children,  and  adolescents  will
ensure that future generations 
are  protected  from  HBV  infection  and  its  consequences.  However,  unless  efforts  to
vaccinate adults at increased risk for 
HBV  infection  are  greatly  expanded,  complete  elimination  of  HBV  transmission  might
take another 20 years to achieve.

 In June 1982, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) published the
first official recommendations 
on the use of hepatitis B vaccine (Table) 
(2). ACIP recommended pre-exposure vaccination initially for groups with a high 
risk  for  HBV  infection.*  However,  by  1989,  it  had  become  evident  that  members  of
these groups (e.g., men who have sex 
with  men  [MSM],  injection-drug  users  [IDUs],  and  heterosexual  persons  with  multiple
partners) were not being vaccinated 
in substantial numbers. Some persons did not recognize the risk for HBV infection, and
others did not know about the 
vaccine or were unable to purchase it. In addition, health-care providers often did not
identify candidates for vaccination 
(CDC,  unpublished  data,  1987).  Health-care  workers  comprised  80%  of  the
approximately 2.5 million 
persons  vaccinated  during  the  1980s;  however,  only  5%  of  acute  hepatitis  B  cases
occurred among health-care workers 
(3).
 In  1991,  recognizing  the  difficulty  of  vaccinating  high-risk  adults  and  the  substantial
burden of HBV-related 
disease  acquired  from  infections  in  childhood,  ACIP  recommended  a  comprehensive
strategy to eliminate HBV transmission in 
the  United  States  (4).  The  strategy  focused  on  universal  childhood  vaccination,
prevention of perinatal HBV 
transmission,  vaccination  of  adolescents  and  adults  in  high-risk  groups,  and  catch-up
vaccinations for susceptible children in 
high-risk  populations.  In  1995,  ACIP  recommended  the  routine  vaccination  of  all
adolescents aged 11--12 years who had not 
been vaccinated previously (5), and in 1999, ACIP recommended that all unvaccinated
children aged <19 years be vaccinated 
(6).  The  ACIP  vaccination  strategies  for  children  and  adolescents  have  been
implemented successfully in the United States, 
and  hepatitis  B  vaccine  is  now  considered  part  of  the  routine  childhood  vaccination
schedule. During 1993--2000, the 
national  coverage  rate  for  hepatitis  B  vaccine  among  children  aged  19--35  months
increased from 16% to 90%, and the coverage 
rate for U.S. adolescents aged 13--15 years increased from near zero to 67%.
 Part of the success of these strategies can be attributed to the availability of expanded
funding for childhood 
vaccinations  and  to  laws  requiring  vaccination  of  school  children.  In  1994,  Congress
enacted Vaccines for Children, a national program 
to  purchase  ACIP-recommended  vaccines  for  eligible  children  aged  <19  years.  Laws
have been enacted in 44 states 
mandating  hepatitis  B  vaccination  for  children  entering  elementary  schools  and
childcare centers and in 34 states requiring 
vaccination for adolescents in middle school 
(7).
 Substantial declines in the incidence of acute hepatitis B have occurred among highly
vaccinated populations, such as 
young children and health-care workers. During 1986--2000, the rate of acute hepatitis
B among children aged 1--9 years 
declined  >80%  (Figure).  During  1983--1995,  the  rate  of  HBV  infection  in  health-care
workers declined 95% and is now lower 
than the rate for the general U.S. population 
(8).
 Since hepatitis B vaccination began in 1982, the prevalence of chronic HBV infection
has been reduced substantially 
among populations whose infection rates previously were high. For example, in 1994,
the prevalence of chronic HBV 
infection  among  Alaska  Natives  aged  <10  years  (i.e.,  children  born  after  routine
vaccination began) was zero, compared with 
16% among Alaska Natives aged 11--30 years 
(9).
Preventing Perinatal HBV Transmission
Since 1982, the control of perinatal infection has been a crucial part of ACIP's evolving
HBV vaccination strategy. In 
1984, ACIP recommended hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening for pregnant
women in groups at high risk for 
acquiring HBV infection and postexposure immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine
and HBIG for all infants born to 
HBsAg-positive  mothers  (10).  However,  within  a  few  years,  studies  showed  that
screening women in high-risk groups failed 
to identify 35%--65% of HBsAg-positive pregnant women 
(11,12). Consequently, in 1988, ACIP recommended that 
all pregnant women be screened routinely for HBsAg 
(13). 
In  1990,  the  federal  government  began  funding  perinatal  hepatitis  B  prevention
programs to promote prenatal screening 
of  all  pregnant  women  for  HBsAg  and  tracking  of  infants  born  to  HBsAg-positive
mothers to ensure that the infants 
receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. These programs have been implemented
successfully. A survey of birthing 
hospitals conducted in 2000 in 14 states showed that 96.5% of pregnant women had
been screened for HBsAg (CDC, 
unpublished data, 2000). During 2000, state health departments identified and tracked
10,192 infants born to HBsAg-positive 
mothers  (CDC,  unpublished  data,  2000).  Of  these  infants,  90%  received  hepatitis  B
vaccine and HBIG before hospital discharge. 
At 
age 6--8 months, 71% of these infants had completed the 3-dose hepatitis B vaccine
series. On the basis of these 
coverage  rates,  CDC  estimates  that  perinatal  HBV  infection  in  the  United  States
declined 75% during 1987--2000 
(CDC, unpublished data, 2000).

were expressed that the vaccine might cause multiple sclerosis. However, a report by
the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found 
no evidence of a causal relation between hepatitis B vaccination in adults and multiple
sclerosis 
(17).  The  vaccine  continues  to  be  considered  safe  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug
Administration, ACIP, IOM, and other national professional vaccination 
advisory groups.
Challenges for the 21st Century
Despite  progress  in  vaccinating  children  and  adults  in  some  occupational  and
racial/ethnic groups, approximately 
1.2 million persons in the United States have chronic HBV infection, and an estimated
4,000--5,000 persons die each year 
from HBV-related liver diseases. The goal of eliminating HBV transmission in the United
States can be achieved only by 
sustaining  a  high  level  of  immunity  against  HBV  infection  in  all  age  groups.  The
prospect for achieving immunity in children is 
already within reach; 90% of U.S. children aged 2 years receive 3 doses of hepatitis B
vaccine, a coverage rate that 
meets  national  health  goals.  To  maintain  high  hepatitis  B  vaccine  coverage,  public
health professionals must ensure that the safety of hepatitis 
B vaccine is monitored appropriately through credible scientific studies that assure 
the public that vaccines are safe. 
Two  important  challenges  for  health  departments  and  health-care  providers  are
maintaining high screening rates 
among pregnant women for HBsAg and ensuring that newborn infants receive proper
immunoprophylaxis. Although high 
screening rates have been achieved among pregnant women, current efforts to identify
and track infants born to 
HBsAg-positive  mothers  are  inadequate.  Advances  in  the  prevention  of  perinatal  HBV
transmission will depend on improved 
health  department  identification,  tracking,  and  case  management  of  infants  born  to
HBsAg-positive mothers 
(18).
Routine vaccination of adolescents must be increased and aggressive efforts made to
vaccinate adults at high risk for 
HBV  infection.  Adolescent  vaccination  will  remain  an  important  goal  for  the  next
decade, until the cohort of vaccinated 
infants  reaches  adolescence.  State  laws  mandating  hepatitis  B  vaccination  for
middle-school children are effective in achieving 
high  coverage  rates  (7).  Adoption  of  these  laws  by  more  states  will  increase  the
adolescent vaccination rate. 
The  greatest  remaining  challenge  for  hepatitis  B  prevention  is  the  vaccination  of
high-risk adults. The rate of hepatitis 
B  vaccination  in  this  group  has  remained  low,  in  part  because  of  the  difficulty  in
identifying candidates for vaccination 
before  they  become  infected  and  limited  public  funding  for  adult  vaccination.  In
serosurveys of MSM aged 15--22 years recruited 
at 
public  venues  in  seven  U.S.  metropolitan  areas  during  1994--1998,  only  9%  had
serologic evidence of hepatitis B 
vaccination  (19).  Among  IDUs  attending  sexually  transmitted  disease  (STD)  clinics  in
San Diego from 1998--2001, only 6% 
reported previous hepatitis B vaccination (CDC, unpublished data, 2002).
The  national  health  objectives  for  2010  call  for  a  reduction  of  75%--90%  in  acute
hepatitis B cases among high-risk 
adults (20). To achieve this goal, adults with behavioral risk factors for HBV infection
must be identified and vaccinated. 
Many
 opportunities
 to
 vaccinate
 high-risk
 adults
 are
 missed.
 For
 example,
approximately 56% of adults with acute hepatitis B 
have received care previously in correctional facilities or STD treatment clinics, where
vaccination could have been offered 
(21).  The  most  effective  approach  to  vaccinating  high-risk  adults  is  to  integrate
hepatitis B vaccination into programs that 
provide  services  to  persons  with  risk  factors  for  HBV  infection  (e.g.,  STD  clinics,  HIV
counseling and testing sites, 
correctional facilities, and drug treatment clinics). CDC is working with state and local
public health departments to 
integrate  comprehensive  hepatitis  prevention  measures,  including  hepatitis  B
vaccination, into programs providing services to 
persons at risk for HBV infection. In addition, CDC has funded cooperative agreements
at 18 sites around the country to identify 
the  most  effective  approaches  to  achieve  integration  of  hepatitis  B  vaccination  into
these programs.
Sustaining  high  vaccine-coverage  rates  among  infants,  children,  and  adolescents  will
ensure that future generations 
are  protected  from  HBV  infection  and  its  consequences.  However,  unless  efforts  to
vaccinate adults at increased risk for 
HBV  infection  are  greatly  expanded,  complete  elimination  of  HBV  transmission  might
take another 20 years to achieve.

 Since 1982, the control of perinatal infection has been a crucial part of ACIP's evolving
HBV vaccination strategy. In 
1984, ACIP recommended hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening for pregnant
women in groups at high risk for 
acquiring HBV infection and postexposure immunoprophylaxis with hepatitis B vaccine
and HBIG for all infants born to 
HBsAg-positive  mothers  (10).  However,  within  a  few  years,  studies  showed  that
screening women in high-risk groups failed 
to identify 35%--65% of HBsAg-positive pregnant women 
(11,12). Consequently, in 1988, ACIP recommended that 
all pregnant women be screened routinely for HBsAg 
(13). 
 In  1990,  the  federal  government  began  funding  perinatal  hepatitis  B  prevention
programs to promote prenatal screening 
of  all  pregnant  women  for  HBsAg  and  tracking  of  infants  born  to  HBsAg-positive
mothers to ensure that the infants 
receive appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. These programs have been implemented
successfully. A survey of birthing 
hospitals conducted in 2000 in 14 states showed that 96.5% of pregnant women had
been screened for HBsAg (CDC, 
unpublished data, 2000). During 2000, state health departments identified and tracked
10,192 infants born to HBsAg-positive 
mothers  (CDC,  unpublished  data,  2000).  Of  these  infants,  90%  received  hepatitis  B
vaccine and HBIG before hospital discharge. 
At 
age 6--8 months, 71% of these infants had completed the 3-dose hepatitis B vaccine
series. On the basis of these 
coverage  rates,  CDC  estimates  that  perinatal  HBV  infection  in  the  United  States
declined 75% during 1987--2000 
(CDC, unpublished data, 2000).
Implementation Challenges
Since  its  inception  in  1982,  the  U.S.  hepatitis  B  vaccination  effort  has  faced  several
challenges. In the mid-1980s, 
concern was expressed about the possible risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
transmission by the original 
plasma-derived  vaccine;  however,  no  transmission  of  any  microbial  agent  was
demonstrated, and the safety of the vaccine was reaffirmed 
(14). Plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccines are no longer used in the United States, but
their use continues safely in other 
countries.  The  vaccines  currently  available  in  the  United  States  are  produced  by
recombinant DNA technology.
In  1991,  some  pediatric-care  providers  were  reluctant  to  accept  the  ACIP
recommendation that all U.S. infants 
be vaccinated. However, by 1996, comprehensive efforts to educate 
providers and parents about hepatitis B and the benefit 
of vaccination had resulted in broad acceptance of the vaccine 
(15).
In  June  1999,  concerns  were  expressed  about  the  risk  to  young  children  of  mercury
exposure from thimerosal, a 
preservative used in childhood vaccines, including hepatitis B vaccine. As a precaution,
the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), 
the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics  (AAP),  and  the  American  Academy  of  Family
Physicians (AAFP) recommended 
postponing  the  first  dose  of  hepatitis  B  vaccine  from  birth  until  age  2--6  months  for
infants born to HBsAg-negative mothers. 
These  groups  also  recommended  eliminating  thimerosal  from  childhood  vaccines  as
soon as possible. By 2000, the two 
companies  that  manufacture  hepatitis  B  vaccine  in  the  United  States  had  eliminated
thimerosal as a preservative from these vaccines, 
and  PHS,  AAP,  and  AAFP  urged  the  resumption  of  hepatitis  B  vaccination  at  birth.
However, the temporary postponement 
of  hepatitis  B  vaccine  at  birth  resulted  in  the  failure  of  some  hospitals  to  immunize
high-risk infants appropriately. This 
situation  persisted  after  vaccines  that  do  not  contain  thimerosal  as  a  preservative
became available 
(16).
Although  concerns  have  been  expressed  over  the  past  20  years  that  certain  chronic
illnesses might be caused by hepatitis 
B vaccine, no evidence exists that any of these diseases is caused by the vaccine. For
example, in the mid-1990s, concerns 
were expressed that the vaccine might cause multiple sclerosis. However, a report by
the Institute of Medicine (IOM) found 
no evidence of a causal relation between hepatitis B vaccination in adults and multiple
sclerosis 
(17).  The  vaccine  continues  to  be  considered  safe  by  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug
Administration, ACIP, IOM, and other national professional vaccination 
advisory groups.

4,000--5,000 persons die each year 
from HBV-related liver diseases. The goal of eliminating HBV transmission in the United
States can be achieved only by 
sustaining  a  high  level  of  immunity  against  HBV  infection  in  all  age  groups.  The
prospect for achieving immunity in children is 
already within reach; 90% of U.S. children aged 2 years receive 3 doses of hepatitis B
vaccine, a coverage rate that 
meets  national  health  goals.  To  maintain  high  hepatitis  B  vaccine  coverage,  public
health professionals must ensure that the safety of hepatitis 
B vaccine is monitored appropriately through credible scientific studies that assure 
the public that vaccines are safe. 
Two  important  challenges  for  health  departments  and  health-care  providers  are
maintaining high screening rates 
among pregnant women for HBsAg and ensuring that newborn infants receive proper
immunoprophylaxis. Although high 
screening rates have been achieved among pregnant women, current efforts to identify
and track infants born to 
HBsAg-positive  mothers  are  inadequate.  Advances  in  the  prevention  of  perinatal  HBV
transmission will depend on improved 
health  department  identification,  tracking,  and  case  management  of  infants  born  to
HBsAg-positive mothers 
(18).
Routine vaccination of adolescents must be increased and aggressive efforts made to
vaccinate adults at high risk for 
HBV  infection.  Adolescent  vaccination  will  remain  an  important  goal  for  the  next
decade, until the cohort of vaccinated 
infants  reaches  adolescence.  State  laws  mandating  hepatitis  B  vaccination  for
middle-school children are effective in achieving 
high  coverage  rates  (7).  Adoption  of  these  laws  by  more  states  will  increase  the
adolescent vaccination rate. 
The  greatest  remaining  challenge  for  hepatitis  B  prevention  is  the  vaccination  of
high-risk adults. The rate of hepatitis 
B  vaccination  in  this  group  has  remained  low,  in  part  because  of  the  difficulty  in
identifying candidates for vaccination 
before  they  become  infected  and  limited  public  funding  for  adult  vaccination.  In
serosurveys of MSM aged 15--22 years recruited 
at 
public  venues  in  seven  U.S.  metropolitan  areas  during  1994--1998,  only  9%  had
serologic evidence of hepatitis B 
vaccination  (19).  Among  IDUs  attending  sexually  transmitted  disease  (STD)  clinics  in
San Diego from 1998--2001, only 6% 
reported previous hepatitis B vaccination (CDC, unpublished data, 2002).
The  national  health  objectives  for  2010  call  for  a  reduction  of  75%--90%  in  acute
hepatitis B cases among high-risk 
adults (20). To achieve this goal, adults with behavioral risk factors for HBV infection
must be identified and vaccinated. 
Many
 opportunities
 to
 vaccinate
 high-risk
 adults
 are
 missed.
 For
 example,
approximately 56% of adults with acute hepatitis B 
have received care previously in correctional facilities or STD treatment clinics, where
vaccination could have been offered 
(21).  The  most  effective  approach  to  vaccinating  high-risk  adults  is  to  integrate
hepatitis B vaccination into programs that 
provide  services  to  persons  with  risk  factors  for  HBV  infection  (e.g.,  STD  clinics,  HIV
counseling and testing sites, 
correctional facilities, and drug treatment clinics). CDC is working with state and local
public health departments to 
integrate  comprehensive  hepatitis  prevention  measures,  including  hepatitis  B
vaccination, into programs providing services to 
persons at risk for HBV infection. In addition, CDC has funded cooperative agreements
at 18 sites around the country to identify 
the  most  effective  approaches  to  achieve  integration  of  hepatitis  B  vaccination  into
these programs.
Sustaining  high  vaccine-coverage  rates  among  infants,  children,  and  adolescents  will
ensure that future generations 
are  protected  from  HBV  infection  and  its  consequences.  However,  unless  efforts  to
vaccinate adults at increased risk for 
HBV  infection  are  greatly  expanded,  complete  elimination  of  HBV  transmission  might
take another 20 years to achieve.
