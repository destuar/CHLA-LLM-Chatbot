this  report  was  posted  online  as  an  MMWR  Early  Release.  CDC  COVID-19  Vaccine
Breakthrough  Case  Investigations  Team  (View  author  affiliations)  Views  equals  page
views  plus  PDF  downloads  COVID-19  vaccines  are  a  critical  tool  for  controlling  the
ongoing  global  pandemic.  The  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  has  issued
Emergency  Use  Authorizations  for  three  COVID-19  vaccines  for  use  in  the  United
States.* In large, randomized-controlled trials, each vaccine was found to be safe and
efficacious  in  preventing  symptomatic,  laboratory-confirmed  COVID-19  (1–3).  Despite
the high level of vaccine efficacy, a small percentage of fully vaccinated persons (i.e.
received all recommended doses of an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine) will develop
symptomatic  or  asymptomatic  infections  with  SARS-CoV-2,  the  virus  that  causes
COVID-19  (2–8).  CDC  is  working  with  state  and  territorial  health  departments  to
investigate  SARS-CoV-2  infections  among  persons  who  are  fully  vaccinated  and  to
monitor trends in case characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 variants identified from persons
with these infections. For this surveillance, a vaccine breakthrough infection is defined
as the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen in a respiratory specimen collected from
a  person  ≥14  days  after  receipt  of  all  recommended  doses  of  an  FDA-authorized
COVID-19  vaccine.  State  health  departments  voluntarily  report  vaccine  breakthrough
infections  to  CDC.†  When  possible,  genomic  sequencing  is  performed  on  respiratory
specimens  that  test  positive  for  SARS-CoV-2  RNA  (9).  A  total  of  10,262  SARS-CoV-2
vaccine breakthrough infections had been reported from 46 U.S. states and territories
as  of  April  30,  2021.  Among  these  cases,  6,446  (63%)  occurred  in  females,  and  the
median  patient  age  was  58  years  (interquartile  range  =  40–74  years).  Based  on
preliminary data, 2,725 (27%) vaccine breakthrough infections were asymptomatic, 995
(10%) patients were known to be hospitalized, and 160 (2%) patients died. Among the
995 hospitalized patients, 289 (29%) were asymptomatic or hospitalized for a reason
unrelated  to  COVID-19.  The  median  age  of  patients  who  died  was  82  years
(interquartile  range  =  71–89  years);  28  (18%)  decedents  were  asymptomatic  or  died
from  a  cause  unrelated  to  COVID-19.  Sequence  data  were  available  from  555  (5%)
reported cases, 356 (64%) of which were identified as SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern,§
including B.1.1.7 (199; 56%), B.1.429 (88; 25%), B.1.427 (28; 8%), P.1 (28; 8%), and
B.1.351 (13; 4%). As of April 30, 2021, approximately 101 million persons in the United
States had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.¶ However, during the surveillance
period, SARS-CoV-2 transmission continued at high levels in many parts of the country,
with  approximately  355,000  COVID-19  cases  reported  nationally  during  the  week  of
April  24–30,  2021.**  Even  though  FDA-authorized  vaccines  are  highly  effective,
breakthrough  cases  are  expected,  especially  before  population  immunity  reaches
sufficient  levels  to  further  decrease  transmission.  However,  vaccine  breakthrough
infections  occur  in  only  a  small  fraction  of  all  vaccinated  persons  and  account  for  a
small  percentage  of  all  COVID-19  cases  (5–8).  The  number  of  COVID-19  cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths that will be prevented among vaccinated persons will far
exceed  the  number  of  vaccine  breakthrough  cases.  To  date,  the  age  and  sex
distribution  of  reported  vaccine  breakthrough  infections  reflects  the  fully  vaccinated
U.S. population.†† The proportion of reported vaccine breakthrough infections attributed
to  variants  of  concern  has  also  been  similar  to  the  proportion  of  these  variants
circulating  throughout  the  United  States.  During  March  28–April  10,  2021,  the
aforementioned  variants  of  concern  accounted  for  70%  of  the  weighted  estimates  of
SARS-CoV-2 lineages submitted to CDC’s national genomic surveillance.§§ The findings
in  this  report  are  subject  to  at  least  two  limitations.  First,  the  number  of  reported
COVID-19  vaccine  breakthrough  cases  is  likely  a  substantial  undercount  of  all
SARS-CoV-2  infections  among  fully  vaccinated  persons.  The  national  surveillance
system relies on passive and voluntary reporting, and data might not be complete or
representative.  Many  persons  with  vaccine  breakthrough  infections,  especially  those
who are asymptomatic or who experience mild illness, might not seek testing. Second,
SARS-CoV-2  sequence  data  are  available  for  only  a  small  proportion  of  the  reported
cases. Beginning May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported COVID-19
vaccine  breakthrough  infections  to  investigating  only  those  among  patients  who  are
hospitalized or die, thereby focusing on the cases of highest clinical and public health
significance. CDC will continue to lead studies in multiple U.S. sites to evaluate vaccine
effectiveness and collect information on all COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections
regardless of clinical status. Additional information and resources to help public health
departments  and  laboratories  investigate  and  report  COVID-19  vaccine  breakthrough
cases

FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective (1–8). CDC recommends that
all persons aged ≥12 years be vaccinated with an FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine¶¶
