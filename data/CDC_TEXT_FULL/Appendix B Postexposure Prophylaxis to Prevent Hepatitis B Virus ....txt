guidelines for management of 
persons with nonoccupational exposure to hepatitis B virus 
(HBV)  through  a  discrete,  identifiable  exposure  to  blood  or  body  fluids  (Table).

of occupational exposures have been published separately

testing  is  recommended  for  certain  employees  (see  Appendix  A,  Postvaccination
Testing for 
Serologic  Response)  and  in  which  programs  are  available  to  implement  testing  and
follow-up algorithms. Recommendations for management of infants born 
to  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  (HBsAg)--positive  mothers  also  have  been  published
separately 
(2).
