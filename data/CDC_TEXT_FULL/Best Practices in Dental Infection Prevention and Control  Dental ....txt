information only on official, secure websites. These best practices provide information
on  a  range  of  topics  relevant  to  clinical  dentistry.   More  about  the  information
presented  can  be  found  in  the  Guidelines  for  Infection  Control  in  Dental  Health-Care
Settingsâ€”2003, the Summary of Infection Prevention Practices in Dental Settings: Basic
Expectations for Safe Care, and other CDC guidelines.  These guidelines are applicable
wherever  dental  care  is  provided.  This  includes  traditional  settings  such  as  private
dental  practices,  dental  clinics,  dental  schools  and  educational  programs  (including
dental assisting, dental hygiene, and laboratory), as well as nontraditional settings that
often  use  portable  dental  equipment,  such  as  clinics  held  in  schools  for  sealant  and
fluoride  placement  and  in  other  sites  for  humanitarian  dental  missions.  Following
recommended infection prevention and control procedures can prevent transmission of
infectious organisms among patients and dental health care personnel. This video, from
CDC's Foundations: Building the Safest Dental Visit training, shows how both patients
and  dental  health  care  personnel  can  be  exposed  to  a  variety  of  infections  during
dental treatment.  Best Practices for Dental Handpieces Best Practices for Dental Unit
