 People get Bartonella quintana through the bite of the human body louse. Body lice
spread from person to person by close physical contact or through shared clothing or
bedding.  B.  quintana  infection  is  most  commonly  associated  with  body  louse
infestations  in  areas  of  high  population  density  and  poor  sanitation.  People
experiencing  homelessness  are  at  increased  risk  of  developing  infection  with  B.
quintana  because  of  limited  access  to  shower  and  laundry  facilities.  B.  quintana
infection occurs worldwide. During the first World War, infection with B. quintana was
referred  to  as  "trench  fever"  due  to  the  many  cases  among  soldiers  who  lived  in
crowded trenches under poor hygienic conditions. As with many Bartonella species, B.
quintana  can  sometimes  cause  infection  of  the  heart  valves  (endocarditis).  In  many
cases,  blood  cultures  might  be  negative  (culture-negative  endocarditis),  which  can
make  the  diagnosis  more  challenging.  Several  species  of  Bartonella  bacteria  cause
disease in people. Languages Language Assistance Languages  Language Assistance
