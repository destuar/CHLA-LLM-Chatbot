the EIS Alumni Association to recognize a current EIS officer or first-year alumnus for
excellence in a scientific manuscript. The prize is awarded based on the public health
significance  and  impact  of  the  manuscript,  as  well  as  the  use  of  epidemiology  in  the
investigation and analysis. Since 1998, the Langmuir Prize has been sponsored by EIS
alumna Joanna Buffington (â€™90) in partnership with the CDC Foundation. The fellowship
application period and host site application period are closed. For questions about the
EIS program, please contact us directly at EISApplication@cdc.gov.
