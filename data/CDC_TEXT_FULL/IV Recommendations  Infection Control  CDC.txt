Isolation  Precautions:  Preventing  Transmission  of  Infectious  Agents  in  Healthcare
Settings  (2007).  These  recommendations  are  designed  to  prevent  transmission  of
infectious agents among patients and healthcare personnel inpatients with suspected
or  proven  SARS  all  settings  where  healthcare  is  delivered.  As  in  other  CDC/HICPAC
guidelines, each recommendation is categorized on the basis of existing scientific data,
theoretical  rationale,  applicability,  and  when  possible,  economic  impact.  The
CDC/HICPAC  system  for  categorizing  recommendations  is  as  follows:  Category  IA
Strongly  recommended  for  implementation  and  strongly  supported  by  well-designed
experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies. Category IB Strongly recommended for
implementation and supported by some experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies
and  a  strong  theoretical  rationale.  Category  IC  Required  for  implementation,  as
mandated  by  federal  and/or  state  regulation  or  standard.  Category  II  Suggested  for
implementation  and  supported  by  suggestive  clinical  or  epidemiologic  studies  or  a
theoretical  rationale.  No  recommendation;  unresolved  issue.  Practices  for  which
insufficient evidence or no consensus regarding efficacy exists. Healthcare organization
administrators should ensure the implementation of recommendations in this section.

590, 592, 593, 551, 594, 595, 418, 596, 597, 583 Category IB I.B.3. Delegate authority
to infection control personnel or their designees (e.g., patient care unit charge nurses)
for making infection control decisions concerning patient placement and assignment of
Transmission-Based Precautions.549, 434, 857, 946 Category IB I.B.4. Involve infection
control personnel in decisions on facility construction and design, determination of AIIR
and  Protective  Environment  capacity  needs  and  environmental  assessments.11,  13,
950, 951, 12 Category IB/IB I.B.4.a. Provide ventilation systems required for a sufficient
number of AIIRs (as determined by a risk assessment) and Protective Environments in
healthcare facilities that provide care to patients for whom such rooms are indicated,
according  to  published  recommendations.11-13,  15  Category  IB/IB  I.B.5.  Involve
infection  control  personnel  in  the  selection  and  post-implementation  evaluation  of
medical equipment and supplies and changes in practice that could affect the risk of
HAI.952,  953  Category  IB  I.B.6.  Ensure  availability  of  human  and  fiscal  resources  to
provide  clinical  microbiology  laboratory  support,  including  a  sufficient  number  of
medical technologists trained in microbiology, appropriate to the healthcare setting, for
monitoring  transmission  of  microorganisms,  planning  and  conducting  epidemiologic
investigations,  and  detecting  emerging  pathogens.  Identify  resources  for  performing
surveillance  cultures,  rapid  diagnostic  testing  for  viral  and  other  selected  pathogens,
preparation  of  antimicrobial  susceptibility  summary  reports,  trend  analysis,  and
molecular  typing  of  clustered  isolates  (performed  either  on-site  or  in  a  reference

management  of  healthcare  personnel  with  communicable  infections.739,  12,  17,
879-881, 955, 134, 690 Category IB/IB I.B.8. In all areas where healthcare is delivered,
provide supplies and equipment necessary for the consistent observance of Standard
Precautions, including hand hygiene products and personal protective equipment (e.g.,
gloves, gowns, face and eye protection).739, 559, 946 Category IB/IB I.B.9. Develop and
implement policies and procedures to ensure that reusable patient care equipment is
cleaned  and  reprocessed  appropriately  before  use  on  another  patient.11,  956,  957,
958, 959, 836, 87, 11, 960, 961 Category IA/IB I.C. Develop and implement processes to
ensure oversight of infection control activities appropriate to the healthcare setting and
assign responsibility for oversight of infection control activities to an individual or group
within  the  healthcare  organization  that  is  knowledgeable  about  infection  control.434,
549,  566  Category  II  I.D.  Develop  and  implement  systems  for  early  detection  and
management  (e.g.,  use  of  appropriate  infection  control  measures,  including  isolation
precautions, PPE) of potentially infectious persons at initial points of patient encounter
in  outpatient  settings  (e.g.,  triage  areas,  emergency  departments,  outpatient  clinics,

 of
epidemiologically-important organisms and targeted HAIs that have substantial impact
on  outcome  and  for  which  effective  preventive  interventions  are  available;  use
information collected through surveillance of high-risk populations, procedures, devices
and highly transmissible infectious agents to detect transmission of infectious agents in
the healthcare facility.566, 671, 672, 675, 687, 919, 967, 968, 673, 969, 970 Category

III.D.  When  transmission  of  epidemiologically-important  organisms  continues  despite
implementation  and  documented  adherence  to  infection  prevention  and  control
strategies,  obtain  consultation  from  persons  knowledgeable  in  infection  control  and
healthcare epidemiology to review the situation and recommend additional measures
for  control.566  247,  687  Category  IB  III.E.  Review  periodically  information  on
community
 or
 regional
 trends
 in
 the
 incidence
 and
 prevalence
 of
epidemiologically-important organisms (e.g., influenza, RSV, pertussis, invasive group A
streptococcal  disease,  MRSA,  VRE)  (including  in  other  healthcare  facilities)  that  may
impact transmission of organisms within the facility.398, 687, 972, 973, 974 Category II
Assume  that  every  person  is  potentially  infected  or  colonized  with  an  organism  that
could be transmitted in the healthcare setting and apply the following infection control
practices during the delivery of health care. IV.A.1. During the delivery of healthcare,
avoid unnecessary touching of surfaces in close proximity to the patient to prevent both
contamination  of  clean  hands  from  environmental  surfaces  and  transmission  of
pathogens  from  contaminated  hands  to  surfaces.72,  73,  739,  800,  975{CDC,  2001
#970  Category  IB/IB  IV.A.2.  When  hands  are  visibly  dirty,  contaminated  with
proteinaceous  material,  or  visibly  soiled  with  blood  or  body  fluids,  wash  hands  with
either  a  nonantimicrobial  soap  and  water  or  an  antimicrobial  soap  and  water.559
Category IA IV.A.3. If hands are not visibly soiled, or after removing visible material with
nonantimicrobial  soap  and  water,  decontaminate  hands  in  the  clinical  situations
described  in  IV.A.3.a-f..  The  preferred  method  of  hand  decontamination  is  with  an
alcohol-based  hand  rub.562,  978  Alternatively,  hands  may  be  washed  with  an
antimicrobial  soap  and  water.  Frequent  use  of  alcohol-based  hand  rub  immediately
following  handwashing  with  nonantimicrobial  soap  may  increase  the  frequency  of
dermatitis.559 Category IB IV.A.3.a. Before having direct contact with patients.664, 979
Category  IB  IV.A.3.b.  After  contact  with  blood,  body  fluids  or  excretions,  mucous
membranes, nonintact skin, or wound dressings.664 Category IA IV.A.3.c. After contact
with  a  patient's  intact  skin  (e.g.,  when  taking  a  pulse  or  blood  pressure  or  lifting  a
patient).167,  976,  979,  980  Category  IB  IV.A.3.d.  If  hands  will  be  moving  from  a
contaminated-body  site  to  a  clean-body  site  during  patient  care.  Category  II  IV.A.3.e.
After  contact  with  inanimate  objects  (including  medical  equipment)  in  the  immediate
vicinity  of  the  patient.72,  73,  88,  800,  981,  982  Category  II  IV.A.3.f.  After  removing
gloves.728, 741, 742 Category IB IV.A.4. Wash hands with non-antimicrobial soap and
water  or  with  antimicrobial  soap  and  water  if  contact  with  spores  (e.g.,  C.  difficile  or
Bacillus anthracis) is likely to have occurred. The physical action of washing and rinsing
hands  under  such  circumstances  is  recommended  because  alcohols,  chlorhexidine,
iodophors, and other antiseptic agents have poor activity against spores.559, 956, 983
Category II IV.A.5. Do not wear artificial fingernails or extenders if duties include direct
contact with patients at high risk for infection and associated adverse outcomes (e.g.,
those in ICUs or operating rooms).30, 31, 559, 722-724 Category IA IV.A.5.a. Develop
an  organizational  policy  on  the  wearing  of  non-natural  nails  by  healthcare  personnel
who  have  direct  contact  with  patients  outside  of  the  groups  specified  above.984
Category  II  IV.B.1.a.  Wear  PPE,  as  described  in  IV.B.2-4,when  the  nature  of  the
anticipated  patient  interaction  indicates  that  contact  with  blood  or  body  fluids  may
occur.739, 780, 896 Category IB/IB IV.B.1.b. Prevent contamination of clothing and skin
during the process of removing PPE (see Figure). Category II IV.B.1.c. Before leaving the
patient's room or cubicle, remove and discard PPE.18, 739 Category IB/IB IV.B.2.a. Wear
gloves  when  it  can  be  reasonably  anticipated  that  contact  with  blood  or  other
potentially  infectious  materials,  mucous  membranes,  nonintact  skin,  or  potentially
contaminated intact skin (e.g., of a patient incontinent of stool or urine) could occur.18,
728,  739,  741,  780,  985  Category  IB/IB  IV.B.2.b.  Wear  gloves  with  fit  and  durability
appropriate  to  the  task.559,  731,  732,  739,  986,  987  Category  IB  IV.B.2.b.i.  Wear
disposable  medical  examination  gloves  for  providing  direct  patient  care.  IV.B.2.b.ii.
Wear disposable medical examination gloves or reusable utility gloves for cleaning the
environment  or  medical  equipment.  IV.B.2.c.  Remove  gloves  after  contact  with  a
patient  and/or  the  surrounding  environment  (including  medical  equipment)  using
proper  technique  to  prevent  hand  contamination  (see  Figure).  Do  not  wear  the  same
pair of gloves for the care of more than one patient. Do not wash gloves for the purpose
of  reuse  since  this  practice  has  been  associated  with  transmission  of  pathogens.559,
728, 741-743, 988 Category IB IV.B.2.d. Change gloves during patient care if the hands
will move from a contaminated body-site (e.g., perineal area) to a clean body-site (e.g.,
face). Category II IV.B.3.a. Wear a gown, that is appropriate to the task, to protect skin
and  prevent  soiling  or  contamination  of  clothing  during  procedures  and  patient-care
activities  when  contact  with  blood,  body  fluids,  secretions,  or  excretions  is
anticipated.739,  780,  896  Category  IB/IC  IV.B.3.a.i.  Wear  a  gown  for  direct  patient
contact  if  the  patient  has  uncontained  secretions  or  excretions.24,  88,  89,  739,  744
Category IB/IC IV.B.3.a.ii. Remove gown and perform hand hygiene before leaving the
patient's environment24, 88, 89, 739, 744 Category IB/IC IV.B.3.b. Do not reuse gowns,
even for repeated contacts with the same patient. Category II IV.B.3.c. Routine donning
of  gowns  upon  entrance  into  a  high  risk  unit  (e.g.,  ICU,  NICU,  HSCT  unit)  is  not
indicated.365,  747-750  Category  IB  IV.B.4.a.  Use  PPE  to  protect  the  mucous
membranes of the eyes, nose and mouth during procedures and patient-care activities
that  are  likely  to  generate  splashes  or  sprays  of  blood,  body  fluids,  secretions  and
excretions. Select masks, goggles, face shields, and combinations of each according to
the need anticipated by the task performed.113, 739, 780, 896 Category IB/IB IV.B.5.
During aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., bronchoscopy, suctioning of the respiratory
tract  [if  not  using  in-line  suction  catheters],  endotracheal  intubation)  in  patients  who
are  not  suspected  of  being  infected  with  an  agent  for  which  respiratory  protection  is
otherwise  recommended  (e.g.,  M.  tuberculosis,  SARS  or  hemorrhagic  fever  viruses),
wear one of the following: a face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face,
a  mask  with  attached  shield,  or  a  mask  and  goggles  (in  addition  to  gloves  and
gown).95, 96, 113, 126, 93, 94, 134 Category IB IV.C.1. Educate healthcare personnel
on  the  importance  of  source  control  measures  to  contain  respiratory  secretions  to
prevent  droplet  and  fomite  transmission  of  respiratory  pathogens,  especially  during
seasonal outbreaks of viral respiratory tract infections (e.g., influenza, RSV, adenovirus,
parainfluenza virus) in communities.14, 24, 684, 10, 262 Category IB IV.C.2. Implement
the following measures to contain respiratory secretions in patients and accompanying
individuals who have signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection, beginning at the
point  of  initial  encounter  in  a  healthcare  setting  (e.g.,  triage,  reception  and  waiting
areas in emergency departments, outpatient clinics and physician offices).20, 24, 145,
902,  989  IV.C.2.a.  Post  signs  at  entrances  and  in  strategic  places  (e.g.,  elevators,
cafeterias)  within  ambulatory  and  inpatient  settings  with  instructions  to  patients  and
other  persons  with  symptoms  of  a  respiratory  infection  to  cover  their  mouths/noses
when coughing or sneezing, use and dispose of tissues, and perform hand hygiene after
hands  have  been  in  contact  with  respiratory  secretions.  Category  II  IV.C.2.b.  Provide
tissues  and  no-touch  receptacles  (e.g.,foot-pedal-operated  lid  or  open,  plastic-lined
waste  basket)  for  disposal  of  tissues.20  Category  II  IV.C.2.c.  Provide  resources  and
instructions  for  performing  hand  hygiene  in  or  near  waiting  areas  in  ambulatory  and
inpatient settings; provide conveniently-located dispensers of alcohol-based hand rubs
and, where sinks are available, supplies for handwashing.559, 903 Category IB IV.C.2.d.
During periods of increased prevalence of respiratory infections in the community (e.g.,
as  indicated  by  increased  school  absenteeism,  increased  number  of  patients  seeking
care  for  a  respiratory  infection),  offer  masks  to  coughing  patients  and  other
symptomatic  persons  (e.g.,  persons  who  accompany  ill  patients)  upon  entry  into  the
facility  or  medical  office.126,  899,  898  and  encourage  them  to  maintain  special
separation,  ideally  a  distance  of  at  least  3  feet,  from  others  in  common  waiting
areas.23,  103,  111,  114,  20,  134  Category  IB  IV.C.2.d.i.  Some  facilities  may  find  it
logistically  easier  to  institute  this  recommendation  year-round  as  a  standard  of
practice. Category II IV.D.1. Include the potential for transmission of infectious agents in
patient-placement decisions. Place patients who pose a risk for transmission to others
(e.g.,  uncontained  secretions,  excretions  or  wound  drainage;  infants  with  suspected
viral  respiratory  or  gastrointestinal  infections)  in  a  single-patient  room  when
available.24,  430,  435,  796,  797,  806,  990,  410,  793  Category  IB  IV.D.2.  Determine
patient  placement  based  on  the  following  principles:  Category  II  IV.E.1.  Establish
policies  and  procedures  for  containing,  transporting,  and  handling  patient-care
equipment  and  instruments/devices  that  may  be  contaminated  with  blood  or  body
fluids.18,  739,  975  Category  IB/IB  IV.E.2.  Remove  organic  material  from  critical  and
semi-critical instrument/devices, using recommended cleaning agents before high level
disinfection  and  sterilization  to  enable  effective  disinfection  and  sterilization
processes.836, 991, 992 Category IA IV.E.3. Wear PPE (e.g., gloves, gown), according to
the  level  of  anticipated  contamination,  when  handling  patient-care  equipment  and
instruments/devices  that  is  visibly  soiled  or  may  have  been  in  contact  with  blood  or
body  fluids.18,  739,  975  Category  IB/IB  IV.F.1.  Establish  policies  and  procedures  for
routine  and  targeted  cleaning  of  environmental  surfaces  as  indicated  by  the  level  of
patient contact and degree of soiling.11 Category II IV.F.2. Clean and disinfect surfaces
that  are  likely  to  be  contaminated  with  pathogens,  including  those  that  are  in  close
proximity  to  the  patient  (e.g.,  bed  rails,  over  bed  tables)  and  frequently-touched
surfaces in the patient care environment (e.g., door knobs, surfaces in and surrounding
toilets  in  patients'  rooms)  on  a  more  frequent  schedule  compared  to  that  for  other
surfaces  (e.g.,  horizontal  surfaces  in  waiting  rooms).11,  73,  740,  746,  993,  994,  72,
800,  835,  995  Category  IB  IV.F.3.  Use  EPA-registered  disinfectants  that  have
microbiocidal (i.e., killing) activity against the pathogens most likely to contaminate the
patient-care environment. Use in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.842-844,
956,  996  Category  IB/IB  IV.F.3.a.  Review  the  efficacy  of  in-use  disinfectants  when
evidence of continuing transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., rotavirus, C. difficile,
norovirus) may indicate resistance to the in-use product and change to a more effective
disinfectant  as  indicated.275,  842,  847  Category  II  IV.F.4.  In  facilities  that  provide
health  care  to  pediatric  patients  or  have  waiting  areas  with  child  play  toys  (e.g.,
obstetric/gynecology offices and clinics), establish policies and procedures for cleaning
and  disinfecting  toys  at  regular  intervals.379,  80  Category  IB  *  IV.F.4.a.  Use  the
following principles in developing this policy and procedures: Category II IV.F.5. Include
multi-use electronic equipment in policies and procedures for preventing contamination
and  for  cleaning  and  disinfection,  especially  those  items  that  are  used  by  patients,
those used during delivery of patient care, and mobile devices that are moved in and
out of patient rooms frequently (e.g., daily).850, 851, 852, 997 Category IB IV.F.5.a. No
recommendation  for  use  of  removable  protective  covers  or  washable  keyboards.
Unresolved  issue  IV.G.1.  Handle  used  textiles  and  fabrics  with  minimum  agitation  to
avoid contamination of air, surfaces and persons.739, 998, 999 Category IB/IB IV.G.2. If
laundry chutes are used, ensure that they are properly designed, maintained, and used
in  a  manner  to  minimize  dispersion  of  aerosols  from  contaminated  laundry.11,  13,
1000, 1001 Category IB/IB The following recommendations apply to the use of needles,
cannulas that replace needles, and, where applicable, intravenous delivery systems.454
IV.H.1.
 Use

equipment.1002,  1003  Category  IA  IV.H.2.  Do  not  administer  medications  from  a
syringe to multiple patients, even if the needle or cannula on the syringe is changed.
Needles, cannulae and syringes are sterile, single-use items; they should not be reused
for  another  patient  nor  to  access  a  medication  or  solution  that  might  be  used  for  a
subsequent  patient.453,  919,  1004,  1005  Category  IA  IV.H.3.  Use  fluid  infusion  and
administration sets (i.e., intravenous bags, tubing and connectors) for one patient only
and
 dispose
 appropriately
 after
 use.
 Consider
 a
