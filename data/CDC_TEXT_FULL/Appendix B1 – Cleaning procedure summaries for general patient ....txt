 This is a low-risk area because the probability of contamination and the vulnerability of
the  patients  to  infection  is  low;  however,  procedural  areas  are  moderate  risk  and
therefore require more frequent and rigorous environmental cleaning. In addition, clean
low-touch surfaces on a scheduled basis (e.g., weekly) This is a low-risk area because
the probability of contamination and the vulnerability of the patients to infection is low.
These  are  high-risk  areas  because  they  have  high  patient  exposure,  are  frequently
contaminated,  and  therefore  pose  a  higher  risk  of  pathogen  transmission  than  other
general patient areas. At least twice daily (public/shared toilets) and as needed Floors
in general inpatient and outpatient areas generally have low patient exposure (i.e., are
low-touch surfaces) and pose a low risk for pathogen transmission. Regardless of the
risk-level  of  an  area,  spills  or  contamination  from  blood  or  body  fluid  (e.g.,  vomitus)
must  be  cleaned  and  disinfected  immediately  using  a  two-step  process.  HAIs  are
associated with medical devices, complications following surgery, transmission between
patients  and  healthcare  workers,  antibiotic  overuse,  and  more.  Languages  Language
