cases of confirmed occupational HIV transmission to health care personnel have been
reported in the United States. An additional 150 possible transmissions have also been
reported to CDC.* How can I prevent occupational HIV transmission? Follow Standard
Precautions  at  all  times.  Assume  that  blood  and  other  body  fluids  are  potentially
infectious. What if an HIV exposure happens at work? If you are exposed to HIV at work,
report your exposure to the appropriate person, and see a doctor or visit an emergency
room  right  away.  Post-exposure  prophylaxis  (PEP)  can  reduce  your  chance  of  getting
HIV  infection.  It  must  be  started  within  72  hours  (3  days)  after  you  may  have  been
exposed to HIV. But the sooner you start PEP, the better. Every hour counts! Clinicians
caring  for  personnel  who’ve  had  a  possible  exposure  can  call  the  PEPline
(1-888-448-4911) for advice on managing the exposure. Clinicians who administer PEP
should tell patients about possible side effects and follow patients closely to make sure
they  take  their  medicine  correctly.  View  CDC’s  Guidelines  for  the  Management  of
Occupational Exposures to HIV and
Recommendations  for  Post-exposure  Prophylaxis  (PEP).  *  Based  on  the  most  recent
data available in December 2013. Of these, only 1 confirmed case has been reported
since 1999.
