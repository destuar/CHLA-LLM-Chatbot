known  about  this  topic?  The  United  States  is  experiencing  high  levels  of  SARS-CoV-2
transmission.  What  is  added  by  this  report?  COVID-19  pandemic  control  requires  a
multipronged  application  of  evidence-based  strategies  while  improving  health  equity:
universal  face  mask  use,  physical  distancing,  avoiding  nonessential  indoor  spaces,
increasing  testing,  prompt  quarantine  of  exposed  persons,  safeguarding  those  at
increased  risk  for  severe  illness  or  death,  protecting  essential  workers,  postponing
travel,  enhancing  ventilation  and  hand  hygiene,  and  achieving  widespread  COVID-19
vaccination  coverage.  What  are  the  implications  for  public  health  practice?  These
combined strategies will protect health care, essential businesses, and schools, bridging
to a future with high community coverage of effective vaccines and safe return to more
activities in a range of settings. Views equals page views plus PDF downloads   In the 10
months  since  the  first  confirmed  case  of  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  was
reported in the United States on January 20, 2020 (1), approximately 13.8 million cases
and  272,525  deaths  have  been  reported  in  the  United  States.  On  October  30,  the
number of new cases reported in the United States in a single day exceeded 100,000
for the first time, and by December 2 had reached a daily high of 196,227.* With colder
weather, more time spent indoors, the ongoing U.S. holiday season, and silent spread of
disease, with approximately 50% of transmission from asymptomatic persons (2), the
United  States  has  entered  a  phase  of  high-level  transmission  where  a  multipronged
approach  to  implementing  all  evidence-based  public  health  strategies  at  both  the
individual and community levels is essential. This summary guidance highlights critical
evidence-based CDC recommendations and sustainable strategies to reduce COVID-19
transmission.  These  strategies  include  1)  universal  face  mask  use,  2)  maintaining
physical  distance  from  other  persons  and  limiting  in-person  contacts,  3)  avoiding
nonessential  indoor  spaces  and  crowded  outdoor  spaces,  4)  increasing  testing  to
rapidly identify and isolate infected persons, 5) promptly identifying, quarantining, and
testing close contacts of persons with known COVID-19, 6) safeguarding persons most
at risk for severe illness or death from infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes
COVID-19,  7)  protecting  essential  workers  with  provision  of  adequate  personal
protective equipment and safe work practices, 8) postponing travel, 9) increasing room
air  ventilation  and  enhancing  hand  hygiene  and  environmental  disinfection,  and  10)
achieving  widespread  availability  and  high  community  coverage  with  effective
COVID-19  vaccines.  In  combination,  these  strategies  can  reduce  SARS-CoV-2
transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic’s
economic  impact.  Consistent  implementation  of  these  strategies  improves  health
equity, preserves health care capacity, maintains the function of essential businesses,
and supports the availability of in-person instruction for kindergarten through grade 12
schools  and  preschool.  Individual  persons,  households,  and  communities  should  take
these actions now to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from its current high level. These
actions  will  provide  a  bridge  to  a  future  with  wide  availability  and  high  community
coverage of effective vaccines, when safe return to more everyday activities in a range
of settings will be possible. Top Universal use of face masks. Consistent and correct use
of face masks is a public health strategy critical to reducing respiratory transmission of
SARS-CoV-2,  particularly  in  light  of  estimates  that  approximately  one  half  of  new
infections  are  transmitted  by  persons  who  have  no  symptoms  (2,3).  Compelling
evidence  now  supports  the  benefits  of  cloth  face  masks  for  both  source  control  (to
protect  others)  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  protection  of  the  wearer.†  To  preserve  the
supply  of  N95  respirators  for  health  care  workers  and  other  medical  first  responders,
CDC recommends nonvalved, multilayer cloth masks or nonmedical disposable masks
for community use.§ Face mask use is most important in indoor spaces and outdoors
when  physical  distance  of  ≥6  feet  cannot  be  maintained.  Within  households,  face
masks should be used when a member of the household is infected or has had recent
potential COVID-19 exposure (e.g., known close contact or potential exposure related to
occupation, crowded public settings, travel, or nonhousehold members in your house).
A community-level plan for distribution of face masks to specific populations, such as
those who might experience barriers to access, should be developed (Table). Physical
distancing and limiting contacts. Maintaining physical distance (≥6 feet) lowers the risk
for  SARS-CoV-2  infection  through  exposure  to  infectious  respiratory  droplets  and
aerosols and is important, even if no symptoms are apparent, because transmission can
occur from asymptomatic infected persons¶ (2,3). Outside the household setting, close
physical contact, shared meals, and being in enclosed spaces have all been associated
with  an  increased  infection  risk  (4–7).  Although  the  impact  of  physical  distancing  is
difficult  to  disaggregate  from  other  interventions,  one  study  estimated  that  physical
distancing  decreased  the  average  number  of  daily  contacts  by  as  much  as  74%  and
reduced the reproductive number (R0, a measure of transmission, which describes the
average number of persons infected by one infectious person) to <1 (8). Because the
highest  risk  for  transmission  has  been  documented  among  household  contacts  of
COVID-19 patients (9), keeping the household safe requires physical distancing, using
the other public health strategies summarized here, and, in particular, consistent and
correct use of face masks (outside the household and in some circumstances within the
household) to prevent introduction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. At the community
level, physical barriers and visual reminders might promote adherence to maintaining
physical distance. Avoiding nonessential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor settings.
Exposures  at  nonessential  indoor  settings  and  crowded  outdoor  settings  pose  a
preventable  risk  to  all  participants.**,††  Indoor  venues,  where  distancing  is  not
maintained and consistent use of face masks is not possible (e.g., restaurant dining),
have  been  identified  as  particularly  high-risk  scenarios  (7,10).  Crowded  events  in
outdoor  settings  have  also  been  linked  to  spread  of  SARS-CoV-2,  although  it  can  be
difficult  to  isolate  the  impact  of  crowded  outdoor  events  from  related  indoor  social
interactions (11). To reduce risk, some restaurants are providing take-away service and
well-ventilated  open-air  dining,  and  in  many  cases,  exercise  or  physical  activity
(individual  or  group)  can  be  moved  to  outdoor  settings  where  physical  distance  is
maintained  and  face  masks  are  worn.  Community-level  policies  can  further  reduce
transmission by promoting flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and hours, as well as by
applying  limits  to  occupancy  of  indoor  spaces  and  to  the  size  of  social  gatherings.
Increased  testing,  diagnosis,  and  isolation.  Isolation  is  used  to  separate  persons
infected with SARS-CoV-2 from those who are not infected; persons who are identified
by testing to be infected should be rapidly isolated.§§ Estimates vary, however, >40%
of  persons  infected  with  SARS-CoV-2  might  be  asymptomatic,  and  transmission  from
presymptomatic  persons  (those  who  are  not  symptomatic  at  the  time  they  transmit
infection,  but  who  later  experience  symptoms)  and  asymptomatic  persons  (infected
persons  who  never  experience  symptoms)  is  estimated  to  account  for  >50%  of  all
transmission  (2,3).  Therefore,  reliance  on  symptom  screening  to  identify  infected
persons is inadequate (12). Increased testing is an important strategy to interrupt silent
transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  from  asymptomatic  and  presymptomatic  persons.
However, because the sensitivity of available tests and the time since exposure varies,
a negative test might provide false reassurance; thus, all prevention strategies should
continue to be followed including use of face masks and maintaining physical distance.
A comparative analysis of data from six large countries demonstrated that high levels
of  testing,  combined  with  robust  contact  tracing,  can  substantially  reduce  the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (13). Frequent testing and contact tracing, combined with
other  mitigation  measures,  effectively  limited  SARS-CoV-2  transmission  on  a  college
campus  (14).  In  addition  to  testing  symptomatic  persons  and  those  with  known
exposure, a strategy of routinely testing certain population groups with high numbers of
interactions with other persons, based on their occupational or residential setting, can
more  rapidly  identify  asymptomatic  and  presymptomatic  infectious  persons  and  their
close  contacts  for  isolation  and  quarantine.¶¶  Communities  with  high  or  increasing
SARS-CoV-2  transmission  should  increase  screening  testing,  focusing  on  persons  at
increased  risk  for  exposure  (e.g.,  workers  in  high-density  worksites)  or  persons  who
might have the potential to transmit infection to large numbers of other persons (e.g.,
persons  working  in  congregate  settings)  or  to  transmit  to  persons  at  risk  for  severe
COVID-19–associated illness or death (e.g., staff members in nursing homes). Expanded
screening testing should be implemented in a manner that promotes health equity for
persons with limited resources or other barriers to accessing health care. In addition,
prompt  reporting  of  test  results  to  the  person  tested  and  to  public  health  authorities
can  facilitate  rapid  isolation,  case  investigation  and  contact  tracing,  and  accurate
monitoring  of  COVID-19  in  the  community.  Prompt  case  investigation  and  contact
tracing to identify, quarantine, and test close contacts. Case investigation is the process
of  obtaining  comprehensive  information  about  persons  with  a  diagnosis  of  COVID-19
and is followed by contact tracing, which includes identifying and communicating with
persons  exposed  to  SARS-CoV-2  (i.e.,  close  contacts***)  to  inform  them  of  their
exposure,  educate  them  about  risks  for  and  symptoms  of  COVID-19,  and  encourage
them  to  quarantine,  seek  testing,  and  monitor  themselves  for  signs  or  symptoms  of
illness.††† Quarantine is used to keep a person who was exposed to SARS-CoV-2 away
from others.§§§ Contact tracing is most feasible when the incidence of COVID-19 in the
community or workplace is low or declining, when testing and reporting of results can
occur  quickly  (15),  and  when  most  contacts  can  be  reached  and  quarantined  (16).
When  one  or  more  of  these  conditions  is  not  met  or  when  local  capacity  is
overwhelmed, health departments should narrow the scope of contact tracing activities
and  emphasize  community  mitigation  measures.  Investigations  should  prioritize
persons who most recently received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results, as well as identify
and quarantine household contacts and persons exposed in a congregate living facility,
high-density  workplace,  or  other  setting  (or  event)  with  potential  extensive
transmission.¶¶¶ Because the risk for household transmission is high and occurs rapidly
in  the  absence  of  face  masks  or  other  protective  behaviors,  household  members  of
persons with diagnosed COVID-19 should be quarantined, and, in the event that they
experience symptoms or receive a positive test result, they should be isolated (9,17).
Eliciting  and  reaching  contacts  in  a  timely  manner  is  challenging  (18,19),  and
quarantine can impose economic and financial burdens (20); adherence to quarantine
might  require  provision  of  appropriate  support  services.****  Persons  who  receive
positive  SARS-COV-2  test  results  should  also  be  encouraged  to  serve  as  their  own
contact  tracers  by  informing  close  contacts  that  they  have  been  exposed  and
encouraging  those  persons  to  quarantine,  monitor  for  symptoms,  and  seek  testing.
Safeguarding persons most at risk for severe illness or death. To protect those who are
at  highest  risk  for  severe  COVID-19–associated  outcomes,  universal  mitigation  efforts
are needed. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be completely asymptomatic or can manifest as
a  life-threatening  illness;  disease  can  result  in  postacute  and  long-term  sequelae  or
disability among survivors. Risk for severe illness increases with age and is highest for
those  aged  ≥85  years.††††  In  the  United  States,  approximately  80%  of  reported
COVID-19 deaths have occurred in patients aged ≥65 years. Certain underlying medical
conditions  also  increase  risk  for  severe  illness  or  death  for  persons  of  any  age  with
COVID-19.§§§§  Long-term  care  facilities  serve  older  adults  and  persons  with  complex
medical conditions; COVID-19 can spread rapidly in these congregate settings, resulting
in  high  rates  of  morbidity  and  mortality.  To  prevent  introduction  and  transmission  of
SARS-CoV-2,  these  facilities  should  implement  strict  infection  prevention  and  control
measures  and  expanded  screening  testing  of  both  staff  members  and  residents  to
rapidly identify and isolate infected persons.¶¶¶¶ COVID-19 has also disproportionately
affected  racial  and  ethnic  minority  groups.*****  An  age-standardized  analysis  of
COVID-19–associated  deaths  reported  to  the  National  Vital  Statistics  System  through
November 25, 2020, found that Black persons accounted for 26.9% of COVID-19–related
deaths, despite representing 12.7% of the U.S. population.††††† Persons who belong to
racial  or  ethnic  minority  groups  are  likewise  disproportionately  affected  by  the
underlying medical conditions that increase risk for severe COVID-19 illness and death,
likely because of long-standing inequities in social determinants of health. Members of
racial  or  ethnic  minority  groups  are  more  likely  to  experience  lower  socioeconomic
status,  to  live  in  crowded  housing,  and  possibly  to  be  employed  in  occupations  that
require  in-person  work.§§§§§  In  addition,  access  to  health  care  might  be  limited,
including obtaining testing and care for COVID-19. Persons who are at highest risk for
severe COVID-19–associated illness or death or who share a household with someone at
high risk should minimize their individual and household risk by avoiding nonessential
interactions with persons outside their household whenever possible and implementing
all
 recommended
 public
 health
 prevention
 strategies.
 Some
 approaches
 to
safeguarding those with underlying medical conditions include promoting access to and
use of telehealth when feasible and appropriate, use of no-contact pickup for groceries
or  other  essential  items,  and  use  of  online  (versus  in-person)  educational  instruction.
Protecting  essential  workers.  Essential  (critical  infrastructure)  workers  include  health
care personnel and employees in other essential workplaces (e.g., first responders and
grocery store workers).¶¶¶¶¶ Protecting essential workers requires full implementation
of all evidence-based strategies outlined in this guidance. When a COVID-19 vaccine is
authorized  for  use  by  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  and  recommended  by
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), essential workers, including
health care personnel, are among the populations being considered for initial phased
allocation  of  limited  vaccine  doses  (21).  Implementation  of  infection  prevention  and
control  with  adequate  supplies  and  extensive  use  of  telehealth  options  and
nurse-directed  triage  of  patients,  as  well  as  screening  of  all  persons  entering  health
care facilities for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, can protect health care personnel
and  reduce  risk  for  SARS-CoV-2  transmission  in  health  care  facilities.******  U.S.  food
manufacturing and agriculture is another sector that has been substantially affected by
COVID-19,  especially  among  workers  in  meat  and  poultry  processing  facilities,  with
disproportionate effects among persons who belong to racial or ethnic minority groups
(22). CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration released guidance on
administrative  and  engineering  controls  that  should  be  part  of  COVID-19  assessment
and control plans for these workplaces.†††††† When cessation of operation of a facility
might cause serious harm or danger to public health or safety, essential workers who
are known close contacts of persons with confirmed COVID-19 might need to return to
work as a last resort; however, if they return to work, they should use face masks and
maintain
 physical
 distancing,
 and
 the
 workplace
 should
 be
 appropriately
disinfected.§§§§§§  These  persons  should  only  return  to  work  if  they  are  and  remain
asymptomatic  and  undergo  at  least  daily  active  symptom  monitoring  with  immediate
removal from the workplace if any signs or symptoms of possible COVID-19 occur; viral
testing of all close contacts is recommended, and those with positive test results should
not  return  to  work.  Postponing  travel.  Travel  increases  the  likelihood  of  SARS-CoV-2
exposure  and  infection  and  could  translocate  infection  between  communities.
Postponing  travel  is  the  best  way  to  reduce  this  risk.¶¶¶¶¶¶  Any  traveler  who  is
symptomatic,  has  had  close  contact  with  a  person  with  COVID-19  and  has  not  met
criteria for release from quarantine, or has a positive or pending SARS-CoV-2 test result
should
 not
 travel.*******
 For
 those
 contemplating
 international
 travel,
 CDC
recommends getting tested with a viral test for SARS-CoV-2 1–3 days before departure
and  getting  retested  3–5  days  after  arrival.†††††††  Domestic  travelers  should  also
consider testing. Testing does not eliminate all risk and should be combined with other
recommended  public  health  strategies.  Both  domestic  and  international  travelers
should stay home or reduce nonessential activities before travel, and for 7 days after
travel  if  tested,  even  if  test  results  are  negative.  If  not  tested,  this  period  should  be
extended  to  10  days.  Travelers  should  be  diligent  about  mask  wearing,  physical
distancing, hand hygiene, and symptom monitoring. For 14 days after arrival, travelers
should avoid close contact with persons at higher risk for severe COVID-19–associated
outcomes and wear masks in household spaces shared with those who did not travel.
Increased room air ventilation, enhanced hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfection.
Increasing room air ventilation, enhancing hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfecting
frequently  touched  surfaces  might  help  decrease  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2
(23).§§§§§§§ Although the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that most transmission
is  close  person-to-person,  there  have  been  some  documented  cases  of  presumed
airborne  transmission.¶¶¶¶¶¶¶  Avoiding  nonessential  indoor  spaces  can  help  reduce
this  risk.  For  indoor  settings,  increased  room  air  ventilation  can  decrease  the
concentration of small droplets and particles carrying infectious virus suspended in the
air and, thereby, presumably decrease the risk for transmission.******** Hand hygiene
includes
 handwashing
 with
 soap
 and
 water
 or
 using
 alcohol-based
 hand
sanitizer.†††††††† Handwashing mechanically removes pathogens, and laboratory data
demonstrate  that  hand  sanitizers  that  contain  at  least  60%  alcohol  inactivate
SARS-CoV-2 (24). These strategies, combined with appropriate cleaning and disinfection
of
 surfaces,
 might
 prevent
 indirect
 transmission
 through
 touching
 surfaces
contaminated  with  virus  from  an  infected  person,  followed  by  touching  the  mouth,
nose,  or  eyes.  Widespread  availability  and  use  of  effective  vaccines.  Widespread
availability  and  high  community  coverage  with  safe  and  effective  COVID-19  vaccines
represent  the  most  important  public  health  strategy  to  control  the  pandemic.  Many
COVID-19  vaccine  candidates  are  currently  in  clinical  trials.  Promising  products  are
being manufactured in anticipation of Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. The
federal government has established a centralized system to order, distribute, and track
COVID-19 vaccines through states, tribal nations, and territories; these jurisdictions are
preparing  for  vaccination  with  extensive  planning  for  vaccine  distribution  and
administration.§§§§§§§§  After  FDA  authorization  of  the  use  of  one  or  more  COVID-19
vaccines in the United States, the ACIP will review safety and efficacy data for each of
the  authorized  vaccines  and  will  issue  recommendations  for  use  to  ensure  equitable
access (21,25). Ensuring transparency in these efforts, monitoring for adverse events,
and  working  with  communities  to  address  concerns  will  be  critical  to  obtaining  the
confidence and trust of the public and health care providers. CDC and FDA will monitor
the effectiveness and safety of all COVID-19 vaccines and update and communicate this
information  regularly.  Vaccinated  persons  should  continue  to  adhere  to  all  mitigation
measures (e.g., mask use, physical distancing, and hand hygiene) until both doses in
the series have been received and the duration of immunity provided by vaccines has
been sufficiently established. Top No single strategy can control the pandemic; rather, a
multipronged approach using all available evidence-based strategies at the individual
and  community  levels  can  break  transmission  chains  and  address  high  levels  of
community transmission; reduce related illnesses, long-term sequelae, and deaths; and
mitigate  the  pandemic’s  economic  impact.  Because  COVID-19  has  disproportionately
affected  persons  with  certain  risk  factors  (e.g.,  age  and  some  underlying  medical
conditions)  and  racial/ethnic  minorities,  implementing  public  health  prevention
strategies in a manner that assures health equity is imperative to safeguard those who
have borne the worst of the pandemic’s impact. The U.S. health care system is being
stressed by COVID-19, with multiple jurisdictions establishing expanded or alternative
treatment settings. Continuing mitigation efforts will be essential to preserve capacity
for adequate treatment of persons with COVID-19 and other urgent health conditions,
and to protect essential and preventive services that are not amenable to telehealth.
Schools provide numerous benefits beyond education, including school meal programs
and  social,  physical,  behavioral,  and  mental  health  services.  Because  of  their  critical
role for all children and the disproportionate impact that school closures can have on
those with the least economic means, kindergarten through grade 12 schools should be
the last settings to close after all other mitigation measures have been employed and
the first to reopen when they can do so safely.¶¶¶¶¶¶¶¶ Similarly, full implementation
of  public  health  prevention  strategies  can  help  preserve  the  functioning  of  essential
businesses  that  supply  food  to  the  population,  contribute  to  the  health  protection  of
communities and individual persons, and fuel economic recovery. Full implementation
of and adherence to these strategies will save lives. As communities respond to high
levels  of  SARS-CoV-2  transmission,  these  strategies  will  also  provide  the  necessary
bridge  to  a  future  with  wide  availability  and  high  levels  of  coverage  with  effective
vaccines, and thereby a safe return to more everyday activities in a range of settings.
