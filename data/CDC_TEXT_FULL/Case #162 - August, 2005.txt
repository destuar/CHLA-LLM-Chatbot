itchy after returning from a 4-week summer camp in the southeastern United States.
Her  parents  took  her  to  the  doctor  where  she  was  examined.  The  doctor  observed
small, whitish objects located near the base of hair shafts on the scalp. Although the
physician  was  able  to  make  a  diagnosis  based  on  what  he  observed  on  the  patient’s
scalp, he did collect a few hairs to examine under the microscope. Figure A shows the
objects that were found on the girl’s head and Figure B shows a close up of the objects
that  were  found  on  the  girl’s  hair  shafts.  What  is  your  diagnosis?  Based  on  what
