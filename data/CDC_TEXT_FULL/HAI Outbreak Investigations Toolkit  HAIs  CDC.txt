 The purpose of this toolkit is to provide the resources to systematically collect data as
part of an HAI outbreak investigation.     The following are tools for conducting an HAI
Outbreak  Investigation,  an  Abstraction  Form  and  a  User's  Guide  with  instructions  for
completing  the  Abstraction  Form.  The  Abstraction  Form  was  designed  for  common
healthcare-associated infections and can be modified depending on the nature of the
outbreak  investigation.  Tailoring  the  Abstraction  Form  may  require  additional
consultation  with  subject  matter  experts  in  the  field  or  a  review  of  the  scientific
literature  describing  similar  outbreaks  in  the  past.  HAI  Outbreak  Investigation  User's
