the  2023-2024  influenza  season  for  clinical  practice  regarding  the  use  of  influenza
antiviral medications. Clinicians may also wish to consult the IDSA antiviral treatment
and  antiviral  chemoprophylaxis  recommendations,  and  the  ATS-IDSA  Adult  CAP
Guidelines. Antiviral treatment is recommended as soon as possible for any patient with
suspected or confirmed influenza who: Decisions about starting antiviral treatment for
patients  with  suspected  influenza  should  not  wait  for  laboratory  confirmation  of
influenza  virus  infection.  Empiric  antiviral  treatment  should  be  started  as  soon  as
possible  in  the  above  priority  groups.  Clinicians  can  consider  early  empiric  antiviral
treatment  of  non-higher-risk  outpatients  with  suspected  influenza  based  upon  clinical
judgment if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset. During periods
of  community  co-circulation  of  influenza  viruses  and  SARS-CoV-2,  empiric  antiviral
treatment  of  influenza  is  recommended  as  soon  as  possible  for  the  following  priority
groups:  a)  hospitalized  patients  with  respiratory  illness;  b)  outpatients  with  severe,
complicated,  or  progressive  respiratory  illness;  and  c)  outpatients  at  higher  risk  for
influenza complications who present with any acute respiratory illness symptoms (with
or  without  fever).  Antiviral  medications  with  activity  against  influenza  viruses  are  an
important  adjunct  to  influenza  vaccine  in  the  control  of  influenza.  Download  Table  1.
Antiviral Medications Recommended for Treatment and Chemoprophylaxis of Influenza
[41  KB,  2  pages]  Abbreviations:  N/A  =  not  applicable,  COPD  =  chronic  obstructive
pulmonary  disease.  In  October  2019,  FDA  approved  an  indication  for  baloxavir
treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza within 2 days of illness onset in people 12
years and older at high risk of developing influenza-related complications, based upon
the  findings  of  a  clinical  trial  (Ison,  2020).  In  this  clinical  trial  of  early  initiation  of
antiviral  treatment  for  uncomplicated  influenza  in  highrisk  patients,  baloxavir  was
superior  to  placebo  and  had  similar  overall  efficacy  to  oseltamivir  in  the  time  to
alleviation  of  symptoms.  For  patients  with  influenza  B  virus  infection,  baloxavir
significantly  reduced  the  median  time  to  improvement  of  symptoms  compared  with
oseltamivir  by  more  than  24  hours.  For  patients  with  influenza  B  virus  infection,
baloxavir  significantly  reduced  the  median  time  to  improvement  of  symptoms
compared  with  oseltamivir  by  more  than  24  hours.  However,  there  are  no  available
data  for  baloxavir  treatment  of  influenza  in  pregnant  people,  immunocompromised
people,  or  in  people  with  severe  influenza  who  are  not  hospitalized.  In  August  2022,
FDA  expanded  approval  of  baloxavir  for  treatment  of  acute  uncomplicated  influenza
within 2 days of illness onset in children aged 5 years to <11 years who are otherwise
healthy  package  insert  XOFLUZA  [963  KB,  22  pages].  This  was  based  upon  the
secondary  clinical  outcomes  of  a  randomized  clinical  trial  of  baloxavir  versus
oseltamivir  for  treatment  of  uncomplicated  influenza  in  children  aged  1  year  to  <12
years
 (Baker,
 2021).
 A
 randomized
 clinical
 trial
 reported
 that
 combination
neuraminidase  inhibitor  (primarily  oseltamivir)  and  baloxavir  for  treatment  of
hospitalized influenza patients aged ≥12 years did not result in superior clinical benefit
(time  to  clinical  improvement)  compared  with  neuraminidase  inhibitor  and  placebo
(Kumar, 2022). In November 2020, FDA expanded approval of baloxavir to include post
exposure  prophylaxis  of  influenza  for  persons  aged  ≥12  years  within  48  hours  of
contact with an individual with influenza, based on the findings of a clinical trial among
household  contacts  of  index  patient  with  influenza  (Ikematsu,  2020).  In  this  study,
baloxavir  post-exposure  prophylaxis  (PEP)  of  influenza  in  household  members  (19%
were  younger  than  12  years;  73%  received  baloxavir  within  24  hours  of  onset  of
symptoms in the index household case who received antiviral treatment) significantly
reduced the risk of laboratory confirmed by 86% among those who received baloxavir
PEP than among those who received placebo (1.9% [7 of 374] vs. 13.6% [51 of 375];
adjusted risk ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.30; P<0.001). In August
2022, FDA expanded approval of baloxavir for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza in
persons  aged  5  years  and  older  within  48  hours  of  contact  with  an  individual  with
influenza package insert XOFLUZA [963 KB, 22 pages]. *Oral or enterically administered
oseltamivir  is  the  recommended  antiviral  for  patients  with  severe,  complicated,  or
progressive illness who are not hospitalized, and for hospitalized influenza patients. For
hospitalized  patients  who  cannot  tolerate  or  absorb  oral  or  enterically  administered
oseltamivir  because  of  suspected  or  known  gastric  stasis,  malabsorption,  or
gastrointestinal  bleeding,  intravenous  peramivir  may  be  considered  (Lee,  2017;  de
Jong, 2014; Ison, 2014; Ison, 2013).  There are insufficient data to support general use
of  inhaled  zanamivir  and  intravenous  peramivir  in  patients  with  severe  influenza
disease. There are no available data from clinical trials on use of baloxavir treatment in
patients with severe influenza disease who are not hospitalized. **Oral oseltamivir and
oral baloxavir are available treatment options for patients at higher risk for influenza
complication  depending  upon  their  underlying  conditions  and  age  (Table  1).  Data  on
use  of  peramivir  or  zanamivir  are  very  limited  in  high-risk  outpatients  with  influenza.

are  circulating  in  the  community  (regardless  of  influenza  vaccination  history)1  
Complete footnotes for this algorithm are available. 1Although all children younger than
5 years old are considered at higher risk for complications from influenza, the highest
risk is for those younger than 2 years old, with the highest hospitalization and death
rates  among  infants  younger  than  6  months  old.  Because  many  children  with  mild
febrile
 respiratory
 illness
 might
 have
 other
 viral
 infections
 (e.g.,
SARS-CoV-2,  respiratory  syncytial  virus,  rhinovirus,  parainfluenza  virus,  or  human
metapneumovirus),  knowledge  of  other  respiratory  viruses  as  well  as  influenza  virus
strains circulating in the community is important for treatment decisions. The following
recommendations do not necessarily represent FDA-approved uses of antiviral products
but are based on published observational studies and expert opinion and are subject to
change as the developmental status of investigational products and the epidemiologic
