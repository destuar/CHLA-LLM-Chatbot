and the title of the report in the subject line of e-mail. FREQUENTLY USED TERMS  The
following are the recommended definitions for key terms in
tuberculosis (TB) control laws:
Active TB. TB disease as demonstrated by clinical,  bacteriologic, and/or radiographic
evidence. Persons who have not
completed a course of anti-TB treatment are considered to have
active TB and may be infectious.
Adherent. Taking anti-TB medications as prescribed.
Case. An occurrence of active TB.
Commitment.  The  confinement  of  a  person  who  has  infectious  TB   or  who  is
noninfectious, but who has not adhered to prescribed
treatment. The purpose of commitment, which occurs under judicial
or administrative order, is to prevent the transmission of
 tubercle
bacilli to others, to prevent the development of drug-resistant
organisms, or to ensure that persons receive a complete course of
treatment.
Contact. A person exposed to a patient who has infectious TB.
Contact
 investigation.
 Interviewing,
 counseling,
 educating,
 
 examining,
 and
investigating activities directed at persons who
have been in close contact with patients who have infectious TB.
Detention.  The  temporary  confinement  of  a  person  who  has  or   who  is  suspected  of
having TB.
Directly Observed Therapy (DOT). Treatment in which  health-care providers or other
designated persons observe
 patients
ingesting anti-TB medications.
Enabler. Anything that helps the patient to more readily  complete therapy (e.g., bus
fare and gasoline).
Exposure. The sharing of air with a person who has infectious  tuberculosis.
Incentive.  Anything  that  motivates  the  patient  to  adhere  to   treatment  (e.g.,  food,
coupons, and personal items).
Infected.  Having  been  exposed  to  someone  with  infectious   tuberculosis,  or  having  a
positive response to a tuberculin skin
test, but not having clinical or radiographic evidence of
 disease.
Some patients who are anergic may not respond to a skin test but
still be infected.
Infectious TB. TB disease in a communicable or infectious  stage as determined by a
chest radiograph, the bacteriologic
examination of body tissues or secretions, or other diagnostic
procedures.
Isolation. An infection control practice designed to prevent  the transmission of tubercle
bacilli.
Nonadherent.
 Not
 taking
 medications
 as
 prescribed
 or
 not
 
 following
 the
recommendations of the attending physician or
 health
officer for the management of TB.
Noninfectious.  Not  capable  of  transmitting  tubercle  bacilli.   A  determination  of
non-infectiousness can be made when a patient
shows significant clinical improvement (e.g., the resolution of
cough and/or fever) and has negative sputum smears on 3
 consecutive
days.
Quarantine. A limitation on the movement of persons exposed  to, or infected with, TB
to prevent the exposure of other
 persons.
Suspected  Case.  A  person  with  signs  or  symptoms  of  TB  for  whom   the  results  of
diagnostic studies are still pending completion.
Tuberculosis  (TB).  Disease  caused  by  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis   complex  (i.e.,  M.
tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, or
Mycobacterium africanum).
TB  Control  Officer.  A  person  appointed  by  the  state  to  be   responsible  for  the
administration of state TB programs.  Summary  Because of its communicable nature,
tuberculosis (TB) is
treated differently than other airborne infectious diseases, as
there are many state laws specific to the control of TB. Many of
these laws predate the current public health recommendations for
the prevention and control of TB. In 1989, CDC published A
Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Tuberculosis in the United
States that was developed by the Advisory Committee (now Council)
for the Elimination of Tuberculosis (ACET) (1). The Plan called for
the establishment of a national goal of TB elimination (i.e.,
achieving a case rate of less than 1 per million population) by the
year 2010. One of the methods for improving disease containment in
the Plan was for the use of quarantine measures for nonadherent
patients. The Plan called for revision of state and local laws to
"facilitate the cure of persons with infectious tuberculosis," (1).
The issue of outdated state TB laws was also identified as a
problem in the National Action Plan to Combat Multidrug-resistant
Tuberculosis (2 ).  In response to this issue, CDC conducted a survey of state TB
control laws and ACET developed recommendations to address
discrepancies between previously published recommendations and
guidelines for the control of TB and state TB control laws. In
order to address these discrepancies, states updating TB control
laws should incorporate current recommendations and guidelines from
CDC, ACET, and the American Thoracic Society. State laws should
permit policies and practices to be rapidly reviewed and amended as
new data becomes available and new recommendations and guidelines
are published.  INTRODUCTION  In 1989, the Advisory Committee (now Council) for the
Elimination of Tuberculosis (ACET) published A Strategic Plan for
the Elimination of Tuberculosis in the United States (1). The plan
promoted the goal of eliminating tuberculosis (TB) (i.e., achieving
a case rate of less than 1 per million population) in the United
States by the year 2010. However, the plan was not fully
implemented, and the number of TB cases reported in the United
States increased. From 1953 to 1984, the number of reported TB
cases in the United States declined at a rate of approximately 5%
per year -- from greater than 84,000 cases in 1953 to approximately
22,000 cases in 1984. However, from 1985 through 1992, reported TB
cases increased 20%. In 1992, 26,673 cases of TB were reported in
the United States -- an incidence rate of 10.5 per 100,000
population. The cases from 1985 through 1992 represent an excess of
greater than 51,000 cases based on the 1980-1984 trend. The
increase in TB cases has been attributed to human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)-associated TB, immigration from countries with high TB
prevalence, substance abuse, homelessness, poverty, and a
deterioration in the public health infrastructure, among other
factors.  The increase in cases of drug-resistant TB is also of concern.
From 1982 through 1986, the proportion of new cases resistant to
both isoniazid and rifampin was 0.5%, but by 1991 the proportion
had increased to 3.3%. Likewise, the proportion of TB cases among
recurrent cases resistant to both drugs increased from 3.0% (1982-
1986) to 7.2% (1991).  Drug resistance is prevalent in certain areas. For example, in
a survey of cases in New York City, 33% had organisms resistant to
isoniazid or rifampin and 19% had organisms resistant to both
drugs. Resistance to both drugs lengthens the course of treatment
from 6 months to 18-24 months, increases the cost of treatment, and
decreases  the  cure  rate  from  approximately  100%  to  60%.   Several  outbreaks  of
multidrug-resistant TB (MDRTB) have
occurred in institutional settings. From 1990 through 1992, CDC
participated in investigations of outbreaks in hospitals and
correctional facilities that involved nearly 300 cases of MDRTB.
These patients had a mortality rate of 43%-89%. To address the
problem of MDRTB, in December 1991 the CDC Director convened a TB
Task Force composed of representatives of federal agencies. In
1992, the TB Task Force developed a National Action Plan to Combat
Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, which details steps to be taken
by federal agencies regarding MDRTB.  Interventions listed in the National Action Plan
(e.g., the
rapid reporting of confirmed and suspected TB cases) are addressed
in state TB-control laws and regulations. The National Action Plan
recommends that states revise their laws and regulations to
facilitate the cure of persons with infectious TB. In the fall of
1991, CDC conducted a survey of state TB-control laws and
regulations. One of the objectives of the National Action Plan was
for ACET and CDC to develop recommendations that address legal
issues of TB controls and to publish these recommendations by 1993.
This report summarizes the results of the survey and provides
recommendations to assist states in revising their TB-control laws
and regulations. These recommendations also may be applicable to
county and municipal health departments. Documents summarizing
recommendations and guidelines from ACET, the American Lung
Association (ALA), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and CDC are
provided  in  the  bibliography.   The  goal  of  state  TB-control  programs  should  be  to
prevent,
control, and eventually eliminate TB. To protect the public from
TB, these programs should ensure that persons with TB receive
appropriate treatment. In addition, states should develop and
encourage implementation of comprehensive programs that address the
needs of persons who have TB, including the integration of TB
services with drug and alcohol treatment programs and the expansion
of public education, particularly for populations at increased risk
for TB. States also should require the application of recommended
infection control measures in health-care facilities and
congregate-living settings (e.g., correctional facilities).  METHODS  TB-control officers in
all states were asked to provide copies
of their TB-control laws and regulations to CDC. Certain provisions
of these laws and regulations were examined: TB reporting
requirements (i.e., the persons required to report cases of TB, the
time frame for reporting, penalties for failure to report, and the
duty to report patients who do not adhere to prescribed treatment),
the restriction of some persons from activities or employment, the
screening of certain populations, contact investigation, procedures
for control and treatment, penalties for patients who do not adhere
to prescribed treatment, the provision of treatment facilities, and
the financing of treatment (Appendix). After the laws and
regulations were examined, the TB-control officers reviewed the
findings for their respective states to clarify any discrepancies.
A draft of the survey and recommendations was made available for
public comment from October 2 through November 16, 1992. Public
comments were solicited through a notice published in the Morbidity
and Mortality Weekly Report (3). A total of 48 persons representing
private organizations and state, county, and local health
departments provided comments about the draft.  RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
Reporting  Requirements   Persons  Required  to  Report  Cases  of  TB   All  states  require
designated health-care professionals to
report cases of TB to local or state health departments. Physicians
are most frequently required to report cases of TB (42 states).
Others required to report test results or cases are laboratory
directors (33 states), hospitals and hospital administrators (31
states), other health-care workers (23 states), school authorities
(22 states), nursing home administrators (15 states), and hospital
infection control officers (six states). Eight states also require
parents and guardians to report cases of TB among household
members. Cases are reported by all states to CDC using the Report
of Verified Case of Tuberculosis (CDC Form 72.9).  Recommendation  
    States should require health-care providers and allied
    professionals who diagnose TB or treat or otherwise care for TB
    patients to report confirmed or suspected cases to the
 appropriate
    health agency. Among these providers and professionals are
    physicians, pharmacists, nurses, infection control officers,
    medical examiners, morticians, and the administrators of
    laboratories or other facilities where TB patients receive
    health-care services. Appropriate systems should be developed
 that
    maximize the reporting of new cases and minimize the reporting
 of
    duplicate cases and suspected cases and that protect the
    confidentiality of reports.  Time Frame for Reporting  State laws regarding the time
allowed for reporting cases of
TB vary from reporting at the time of diagnosis to within 1 week of
diagnosis. Thirteen states require reporting at the time of
diagnosis, 14 states within 24 hours of diagnosis, seven states
within 48 hours, three states within 72 hours, and six states
within 1 week. Six states do not specify a time frame for
reporting.  In nine states, the time frame for reporting cases of TB
depends on the reporting source. For example, physicians may be
required to report cases of TB within 7 days of diagnosis, whereas
institutions in the same state are required to report cases within
48 hours. Reporting requirements for laboratory directors vary from
reporting at the time of identification of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis to reporting results once a week.  Recommendations  
    Confirmed and suspected cases should be reported within 2
    working days of identification of M. tuberculosis to the health
    agency with primary responsibility for TB control in that
    jurisdiction. Reporting should be based on a diagnosis or a
    presumptive diagnosis. Local health departments should report
    confirmed and suspected cases to the state TB-control agency
 within
    1 working day of notification.  
    When a case of TB is identified as being drug resistant, the
    case should be reported again within 2 working days in a manner
    consistent with the reporting of confirmed and suspected cases
 of
    TB. The report of drug-resistant TB also should include the
 results
    of susceptibility tests.  
    All bacteriologic and pathologic laboratories that perform
    diagnostic services or perform related drug-susceptibility tests
    for M. tuberculosis should be required to report the results for
    any person whose sputa, gastric contents, or other specimens
    submitted for examination reveal the presence of tubercle
 bacilli.
    These results should be reported to the local health department
    within 1 working day of identification.  
    Laboratories that perform diagnostic services on specimens
    from other states should be required to report the results to
 the
    state health department TB program from which the specimen was
    received. Reports should include the patient's name, address,
 and
    physician, and the person or agency referring the positive
 specimen
    for laboratory evaluation.  Failure to Report Cases of TB  Twenty-nine states have
statutory authority to impose a
penalty on persons who are required to report TB cases but fail to
do so. Five states impose a penalty only when the failure to report
a case is willful. Those persons found guilty of failing to report
cases  may  be  convicted  of  a  misdemeanor  and  fined  from  $5  to  $500.  
Recommendation  
    Because the rapid and accurate reporting of TB cases is
    critical to the management of TB patients, states should have
 the
    authority to impose a penalty for the willful failure to report
    confirmed and suspected cases of TB within the required time
 frame.
    In addition to imposing a penalty, states may refer reporting
    violations to professional licensing boards or, in the instance
 of
    a laboratory, to the licensing agency.  Duty to Report Nonadherent * Patients  Eleven
states require health-care providers to report
nonadherent patients. Two states also require the attending
physician to notify the state health department when a patient has
completed treatment for TB.  Recommendations  
    TB patients who have demonstrated an inability or an
    unwillingness to adhere to a prescribed treatment regimen should
 be
    classified as nonadherent. Patients should be considered unable
 or
    unwilling to adhere to prescribed treatment if they do not
 report
    for directly observed therapy (DOT), refuse medication, or show
    other evidence of not taking medications as prescribed (e.g.,
    incorrect pill counts or urine test showing no evidence of drug
    metabolites).  
    Any health-care professional who is aware of a nonadherent TB
    patient should contact the appropriate health official for
    necessary interventions. The health official or a designated
    representative should meet with the patient to determine why the
    patient is nonadherent. The patient may be unwilling to continue
    treatment because the medication is causing side effects,
 because
    the patient may have difficulty obtaining additional medication,
 or
    because the patient believes the medication is no longer
 necessary.
    After determining why the patient is not adhering to the
 treatment
    regimen, the health official should take appropriate action,
 such
    as seeking court-ordered DOT.  Additional Reporting Recommendations  Reporting
requirements should include any confirmed or
suspected case of active disease caused by M. tuberculosis complex
(i.e., M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and/or Mycobacterium
africanum). State laws also should require drug susceptibility
tests for all patients for whom a specimen is available. The
results should be reported to local and/or state health
departments. Reporting laws should require that all reports and
records of clinical or laboratory examination for the presence of
TB be kept in a confidential registry maintained by the state
health agency.  When not prohibited by law, states also should require that
information on the patient's HIV infection status, when known, be
included in TB case reports. From a surveillance perspective, the
inclusion of the patient's HIV status is important to determine the
impact of the HIV epidemic on TB cases; this information also is
important for case management and prioritizing contact
investigations.  If HIV-related information is reported, states should ensure
that this information is protected under their specific HIV and
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) reporting laws and
confidentiality laws. If a state does not have specific HIV or AIDS
confidentiality laws, it should ensure that HIV-related information
is protected by applicable confidentiality laws for infectious
diseases, communicable diseases, or sexually transmitted diseases,
or by other provisions for the protection of patient medical
records.  Health agencies that maintain both an HIV or AIDS registry and
a TB registry should permit the sharing of information between the
registries to assist in case finding, particularly when the HIV or
AIDS registry has information regarding persons infected with TB
whose names have not been reported to the TB registry. Information
about a person's HIV or AIDS status must be protected, even when it
is reported to or shared with another division within a health
department.  Federally assisted substance-abuse treatment programs must
report HIV- and TB-related information for all patients in a manner
consistent with federal regulations for completing Confidentiality
of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Patient Records **. Once the information
from such treatment programs is reported to states, the information
should be protected in a manner consistent with the regulations.  Management of TB
Cases  Provision of Treatment  Sixteen states specify that state-supported outpatient
treatment must be made available for persons with TB. Twenty-nine
states recommend that TB patients voluntarily seek treatment before
health officials seek state intervention.  Recommendations  
    State laws should require that all TB patients receive
    immediate treatment according to the most recent ATS/CDC and
 ACET
    treatment guidelines. These guidelines include a) the
 examination
    of persons exposed to TB and persons suspected of having active
 TB,
    b) the treatment of persons who have latent infection or active
 TB,
    c) the duration of treatment, and d) the means for preventing TB
    patients from infecting other people. States also should require
    that health-care providers document patients' adherence to
    prescribed therapy.  
    States should require that health-care workers providing care
    to patients with confirmed or suspected TB develop
 individualized,
    comprehensive treatment plans for all TB patients. The plans
 should
    be developed in cooperation with the patients and the
 appropriate
    health department and discussed with patients before they are
    discharged from treatment facilities. In addition, clinicians or
    other designated persons in all correctional facilities should
    develop individualized, comprehensive discharge plans for all
    TB-infected inmates who will be released from the facility
 before
    they complete the prescribed course of therapy.  
    Patients who do not adhere to self-administered therapy should
    receive DOT. In addition, states should require the isolation of
    nonadherent, infectious patients while they are receiving
    treatment. Persons who have drug-resistant TB should be treated
    according to the most recent CDC treatment guidelines for
    drug-resistant TB.  Penalty for Nonadherent Patients  Three states have provisions for
imposing a fine on TB
patients who do not adhere to treatment. Four states specify
certain behaviors that violate TB laws (e.g., breaking quarantine
or willfully transmitting disease), and 29 states provide that
anyone who violates the TB-control law may be quarantined. Two
states have provisions for imposing an undefined penalty on
nonadherent patients. In one state, violation of a treatment plan
or disruptive behavior within an institution justifies transfer to
a correctional facility where treatment will be provided.  Recommendation  
    Penalties for nonadherent behavior should be levied only after
    the use of incentives, enablers, voluntary or ordered DOT, and
    commitment for inpatient management have failed to result in
    adherence to treatment.  Restrictions for Persons Infected with TB  Sixteen states
require that persons infected or suspected of
being infected with TB be restricted from various activities.
Typically, state laws require that persons infected with TB be
excluded from work until they are no longer infectious or until the
absence of TB has been medically demonstrated.  Recommendation  
    Restricting the activities of a person with TB should be based
    on whether the person has infectious TB and poses a risk to
 others.
    Restrictions should be terminated when the person is no longer
    infectious.   Quarantine  of  Persons  with  TB   Forty-three  states  provide  for  the
quarantine of TB patients
within their own homes. States define quarantine broadly and
specifically. Statutes and regulations also provide guidelines for
the movement of patients outside of the home. Thirty-five states
specify that a quarantine should last until the person is no longer
infectious. However, the health officer with jurisdiction over the
patient frequently determines the exact length of quarantine.  Recommendation  
    Quarantine, the traditional public health intervention of
    isolating persons who are exposed to an infectious disease but
 are
    not yet infected, is no longer an appropriate TB control
 measure.
    For patients with active TB who adhere to treatment, temporary
    restriction to their primary residence may adequately protect
    others from exposure. Such patients should be restricted to
 their
    residence until they are noninfectious. Appropriate residence
    facilities should be designated for the care of homeless persons
    infected  with  active  TB.   Commitment  of  Persons  with  Infectious  TB  to  Treatment
Facilities  Forty-two states permit the commitment of TB patients to
treatment facilities. However, the legal process for commitment and
the duration of commitment vary in each state. Twenty-four states
require that persons committed for TB treatment remain hospitalized
until they no longer pose a health threat to others. Many state
laws specify that this condition be met when a patient becomes
noninfectious. Seven states recommend that a patient remain
hospitalized until cured, and six states allow commitment of
persons with infectious TB for an unspecified period of time.  Some states allow patients
who have been committed to petition
the court for a discharge and/or to appeal the decision. One state
provides the patient the right to petition the court for discharge
after 6 months, and nine states allow the patient to appeal the
commitment.  Recommendations  
    Before committing TB patients for inpatient treatment, states
    should adopt step-by-step interventions beginning with DOT and
    supplemented by incentives and enablers. If a patient does not
    voluntarily adhere to DOT, the next step may be DOT that is
 ordered
    by a public health official or a court. Only after the patient
 has
    demonstrated an inability or an unwillingness to adhere to
    treatment regimens should admission to a treatment facility be
    initiated. Commitment for inpatient management should be viewed
 as
    the last measure for treatment of persons infected with TB.
    However, when a person who has active, infectious TB refuses to
 be
    isolated, emergency detention to isolate the person is
 appropriate.  
    State laws should permit the involuntary isolation and
    detention of noninfectious patients who, after being offered
 less
    restrictive alternatives, refuse to adhere to a treatment
 regimen
    or to complete treatment. These persons are at risk for
    drug-resistant TB, which can be transmitted to others.  
    Commitment laws should specify a) where patients will be
    treated, b) the duration of commitment (e.g., until treatment is
    complete or until there is evidence that the patient will adhere
 to
    the remainder of the treatment regimen), and c) the
 reimbursement
    mechanism for the treatment.  
    States should authorize the examination of persons suspected
    of having TB and the emergency isolation and detention of
 persons
    who have infectious TB. Such laws will permit local health
 officers
    to examine the contacts of persons with infectious TB who are
    unwilling to seek evaluation and/or treatment. The laws would
    permit local health officers to isolate and detain persons who
 have
    infectious TB but who are unable or unwilling to receive
 treatment
    to prevent transmission. The court review of emergency detention
    should expeditiously follow the isolation of TB patients in a
    treatment facility. Voluntary treatment should be pursued;
 however,
    appropriate commitment procedures should be initiated
 immediately
    for patients who do not consent to isolation and treatment.  
    As in commitment proceedings under state mental health laws,
    any law under which a person may be examined, isolated,
 detained,
    committed, and/or treated for TB must meet due process and equal
    protection requirements under state and federal statutes and
    constitutions. Also, all patients who are subject to these legal
    proceedings  should  be  represented  by  legal  counsel.   Commitment  Orders.  When
determining whether the commitment of
a person with TB is necessary to protect the health of the public,
local health officers should determine whether that person presents
a substantial risk for infecting others or developing
drug-resistant disease. This determination should be based on an
individualized assessment of the situation, including consideration
of the following factors:  
    Laboratory results or, in the absence of laboratory tests,
    clinical signs and symptoms of infectious TB;  
    Previous treatment for TB but failure to complete therapy for
    reasons unrelated to access to treatment or medication;  
    Adherence to prescribed therapy;  
    Risk for infecting others depending on the patient's housing
    and employment situation;  
    Laboratory tests or a history of nonadherence to anti-TB
    chemotherapy indicate possible infection with drug-resistant M.
    tuberculosis.  When local health officers determine that commitment is
necessary to protect the health of the public, they should issue a
commitment order in writing to local authorities. The order should
specify the name of the infected person, the period of time during
which the order is to remain effective, the facility to which the
person will be committed, and other terms or conditions necessary
to protect the health of the public. When an order is issued, a
copy of the order should be given to the person named in the order.
  The commitment order should require that the person infected
with TB be isolated until he/she is determined to be noninfectious.
This decision should be based on laboratory results demonstrating
that the person is smear negative and asymptomatic or based on the
local health officer's determination that the person has completed
a course of therapy consistent with the most recent ATS/CDC
treatment recommendations. The person also should be ordered to
receive treatment in a hospital or other appropriate facility until
cured, unless the person's voluntary completion of the ordered
therapy can be ensured. If the person refuses to consent to the
ordered treatment, the health officer should have the authority to
extend  the  commitment  order  as  necessary.   After  receiving  information  that  a
commitment order has been
violated, health officers should notify the appropriate official in
the jurisdiction (e.g., a judge in the county where the person
resides) that a violation of the order has occurred. This
notification should be in writing and should explain the rationale
for  the  hospitalization  and  the  facts  about  the  violation.   Treatment  Facilities   State
statutes and regulations provide for TB treatment at
public hospitals, sanitoria, and private hospitals that have
entered into agreements for such treatment with states.
Thirty-three states provide or approve facilities for the treatment
of TB patients. Twenty-one states have adopted detailed guidelines
for the testing, monitoring, and care of the TB patient in
treatment facilities.  Recommendations  
    To more efficiently treat TB patients, states should permit
    cities, counties, or groups of counties to establish and
 maintain
    a variety of facilities for treating persons infected with TB.
 Such
    facilities include shelters for the homeless, halfway houses,
 and
    short- or long-term care facilities such as hospitals.  
    State health departments should develop standards based on the
    current ATS/CDC recommendations and guidelines for local
 TB-control
    programs and facilities to use in treating TB and controlling
 its
    transmission.  Financing of Treatment  TB-control statutes in 46 states specify that
the state will
provide some reimbursement for patient care. Payment provisions
vary among these states. For example, three states provide funding
for the treatment of indigent patients only; three states offer
sliding-scale payments according to the patient's financial status;
and six states require that if a patient has third-party insurance,
the third-party payor must be the first payor and the state the
payor of last resort.  Recommendation  
    States should specify how the treatment of TB patients will be
    paid. The patient's inability to pay for treatment should not be
 a
    barrier to receiving effective treatment. Assuring treatment for
    all patients, regardless of their ability to pay, is critical to
    preventing  the  transmission  of  TB  in  the  community.   Investigation  of  TB  Cases  
Forty-nine states require the investigation of reported cases
of TB. Forty-five states specify that an investigation can be
conducted when a health official receives a report of a confirmed
or suspected case of TB. Forty-one states authorize health
departments to investigate under certain circumstances, such as
when a health officer suspects or knows of a case of TB.
Twenty-nine states specifically require contact investigations for
reported cases of TB.  Recommendations  
    States should require local health officers to conduct
    immediate contact investigations for all reported or suspected
    cases of pulmonary TB. During the investigations, each health
    officer should be authorized to examine and order the isolation
 of
    persons suspected of having or known to have infectious TB and
 to
    detain persons known to be nonadherent to prescribed therapy.  
    Health officers should be authorized to order a physical
    examination of persons suspected of having TB. The examination
    order should be submitted in writing and should specify the name
 of
    the person to be examined, the time and the place where the
    examination is to be conducted, the medical basis for the
    examination order, and any other terms or conditions necessary
 to
    protect the health of the public. In addition, health officers
    should have the authority to review all patient records of both
    public and private institutions, clinics, and practices where TB
    patients  are  treated.   Screening  for  TB   Forty-four  states  require  that  certain
populations be screened
for TB. Screening is frequently required for school employees (20
states), employees of medical facilities (18 states), and day care
employees (11 states). TB testing is typically required before the
start of employment. Eleven states also require that schoolchildren
be screened for TB.  Recommendation  
    To eliminate TB, states must interrupt the transmission of
    tubercle bacilli by preventing, identifying, and treating
    TB-infected persons. TB screening may include screening for
 latent
    TB infection, active disease, or both. Screening requirements
    should be based on an analysis of epidemiologic data (including
    disease frequency and the demographic and geographic
 distribution
    of disease in the community) and morbidity trends, and
    ALA/ATS/CDC/ACET recommendations and guidelines for screening
    populations, institutions (including health-care and
 correctional
    facilities), and personnel.  TB-Control Officers  State laws and regulations generally
do not designate a
TB-control officer to supervise the state TB-control program.
However, every state currently has a designated person responsible
for their state TB-control program.  Recommendation  
    Each state should designate a TB-control officer to supervise
    TB-control programs. These officers should have sufficient
    authority to address the current problems in TB control.  Responsibilities. TB-control
officers should be responsible
for all statewide TB- control activities. They should cooperate
with local health departments and other appropriate organizations
to conduct or supervise clinics that diagnose, treat, and control
TB throughout the state. The officers should maintain a registry of
all cases, suspected cases, and contacts.  Authority. To conduct TB-control measures,
TB-control officers
must have the authority to examine all records, reports, and other
data pertaining to confirmed and suspected TB patients. The records
of the TB-control officer must be confidential and the identity of
patients must not be disclosed, except where disclosure is
necessary as part of official TB-control activities.  In addition, the officers should have
the authority to examine
or order the examination of any person known to have or suspected
of having TB. The officers also should be authorized to perform or
order any laboratory tests or radiographic examinations necessary
to  diagnose  and  treat  any  patient  who  has  TB.   TB-control  officers  should  have  the
authority to issue
emergency examination, isolation, and detention orders for persons
suspected of having active TB, and issue commitment orders for
persons who have active TB or who are nonadherent to the prescribed
therapy. Such decisions should be based on guidelines issued by the
state health department. TB-control officers also should be
directed to cooperate with state and federal agencies in the
prevention  and  control  of  TB.   CONCLUSION   A  survey  of  state  TB-control  laws  and
regulations indicates
that states differ in their approach to the control of TB. This
report provides recommendations from the ACET that can be used in
revising state TB-control laws. The purpose of providing these
recommendations is to increase uniformity among TB-control
programs. These recommendations also are designed to encourage
states to adopt flexible TB-control laws and regulations that will
accommodate new TB-control recommendations and guidelines as they
are published.  The goal of TB-control programs is to eliminate TB by
appropriately treating persons infected with TB, to safeguard the
confidentiality and civil liberties of persons who have TB, and to
protect them from unlawful discrimination because of their disease

             Goals for state tuberculosis control programs
====================================================
=======================
States should have systems that incorporate the following
guidelines:
- Ensure the mandatory reporting of each confirmed and suspected
  case of TB, and observe local laws and regulations protecting
  patient confidentiality;
- Examine persons at high risk for TB infection and disease,
  prescribe the appropriate preventive or curative treatment for
  these persons, and monitor their treatment;
- Monitor the treatment of patients, and require that a treatment
  plan be devised for all hospitalized patients before they are
  discharged;
- Ensure the rapid laboratory examination of specimens and
  reporting of results to the appropriate health department and the
  requesting clinician;
- Ensure that TB-infected patients receive treatment until they are
  cured;
- Protect the health of the public by isolating and treating
  persons who have infectious TB and detaining persons who, although
  not infectious, are unwilling or unable to complete their treatment
  and are at risk for becoming infectious and for acquiring
  drug-resistant TB;
- Finance the treatment of indigent patients.
