and the title of the report in the subject line of e-mail. Since October 2001, a total of 27
states has reported investigations of multiple groups of schoolchildren who 
have developed rashes. Rash illnesses among schoolchildren in 14 states were reported
in March 
(1); since the initial report, rashes have been reported in 13 additional states (Alabama,
Alaska, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, 
Maryland,  Massachusetts,  Minnesota,  Missouri,  New  Hampshire,  and  New  Jersey).
Rashes also have been reported 
among  schoolchildren  in  Canada.  The  investigations  have  not  identified  a  common
source for the reported cases of rashes 
among U.S. schoolchildren. This report summarizes available data on these rashes and
provides examples for three states. CDC 
is continuing to monitor reports of rashes and is providing technical assistance to state
and local health 
departments investigating these reports.
United States
Although rashes among schoolchildren are common, public concern has been growing
because of the number 
of  simultaneous  cases  reported  in  schools  across  the  United  States.  During  October
2001--May 2002, rashes among groups 
of  students  were  reported  in  approximately  110  U.S.  elementary,  middle,  and  high
schools. The number of students affected 
in each school ranged from five to 274; the proportion of students affected ranged from
<1% to 47%. The sex distribution 
of cases varied among the schools, ranging from 33% to 100% female. Rashes varied
by presentation, location on the body, 
and duration. Most affected children were reported as having 1) a pruritic, sunburn-like
rash that appeared on the cheeks 
and arms, 2) a burning sensation on the skin that might be associated with pruritis, or
3) a hive- or nettle-like reaction that 
was  observed  moving  from  one  part  of  the  body  to  another.  Rashes  tended  to  be
self-limiting and ranged in duration from 
<1 hour to >1 month. Because of the transient nature of the rashes, most children who
were evaluated were seen by 
school  nurses;  some  children  who  had  recurring  or  persistent  rashes  were  seen  by
dermatologists. Accompanying signs and 
symptoms  such  as  conjunctivitis,  fever,  vomiting,  sore  throat,  or  headaches  were
absent in all but a few cases. The etiology of the 
rash illnesses remains unknown in several states. Alaska, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota,
Mississippi, and New York have 
received  reports  of  cases  associated  with  parvovirus  B19,  and  other  states  have
investigated small reports of rash illness that appear 
to be primarily psychogenic in response to a child with a diagnosed rash or infection.
Case Reports
New York. On March 8, 2002, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) sent
a notice to local health 
units and school superintendents across the state to increase awareness and reporting
of outbreaks of rash illness. At the 
time, NYSDOH and a county health department were following an ongoing outbreak of
rash illness, which began in January 
and by April 2 involved 242 (7%) elementary- and middle-school students in a school
district with 3,371 children. No fevers 
or  other  major  signs  and  symptoms  were  reported  to  accompany  the  rashes,  and  no
rash illness was reported among 
employees in affected schools. To assess the outbreak, school nurses selected a sample
of affected students with active rashes from 
five  elementary  schools  and  one  middle  school;  17  children  with  rashes  were
interviewed on April 2 and evaluated by a team 
of health-care providers by physical examination, serology for parvovirus B19, and viral
cultures of throat and stool 
specimens. Dates of rash onset for these 17 children ranged from March 11 to April 1.
Of the 17 children interviewed, 12 (71%) 
were females. The ages of the students ranged from 5--13 years (mean: 9 years). Five
(29%) children reported having 
had symptoms (e.g., fatigue, stuffy nose, and sore throat) that occurred within 4 days
before rash onset. Of six (35%) 
children who reported that another family member had a rash, four (67%) had family
members whose rashes occurred before 
the child's rash onset, and two  (33%) had family members whose onset followed the
child's rash. Fifteen (88%) children 
reported their rashes to be itchy; of these, nine (60%) children reported no association
with time of day or place. Three (18%) of 
the 17 children that were interviewed reported having a low-grade fever (i.e., <100.3º 
F [37.9º C]), nine (53%) children reported that the rashes were warm to the touch, eight
(47%) children associated the rashes with a burning sensation, and 13 
(77%) children reported that the rashes reappeared; information for one child was not
recorded. Five (29%) children had rashes 
that began on the face and nine (53%) children rashes that began on the extremities or
stomach before spreading; two 
(12%) children had rashes that did not spread. On examination, health-care providers
described the rashes as maculopapular in 
13  (77%)  cases,  lacy  and  reticular  in  14  (82%)  cases,  and  morbilliform  in  six  (35%)
cases. All 17 children submitted 
specimens for viral studies; 16 (94%) had negative viral throat cultures, and one was
positive for influenza A. Stool specimens 
were submitted by nine children; all were negative on viral culture. Human parvovirus
B19 antibody assays were performed on 
14 children; 13 (93%) were positive for IgM antibodies, and 14 (100%) were positive for
IgG antibodies. The results of 
this investigation support the conclusion that the outbreak was due to parvovirus B19,
which causes erythema infectiosum 
(i.e., fifth disease).
Georgia. During January, the Georgia Division of Public Health received a report that 12
students from an 
elementary school had developed pruritic rashes in a single day; 10 children were in the
same class. Dermatologists who examined all 
12  children  diagnosed  the  rashes  as  contact  dermatitis.  The  rashes  resolved  by  the
next day, and no additional cases occurred. 
The school cleaned the classroom on the day the rashes occurred, including vacuuming
the carpet, washing table tops, and 
wet dusting all surfaces. The school nurse determined that the pruritic rashes were the
only sign or symptom; one child had 
a history of a preceding illness (a cold the previous week). The onset of rash illnesses
began after one child developed a 
pruritic eczematic rash on one arm. After several minutes, a second child complained
that her arm was itching; within the hour, 
eight  children  seated  at  the  same  table  also  were  scratching  their  arms  and
complaining about rashes. A child from 
another classroom reported a pruritic rash after sitting with the other children at lunch;
another child, also from another 
class,  reported  a  rash  after  seeing  the  index  child  in  the  school  clinic.  Although
environmental or allergic exposure cannot be 
ruled out, the school nurse's description suggests that all the rashes (with the exception
of the index case) were caused by 
scratching secondary to observing, encountering, or interacting with the child with the
eczematic rash.
Missouri.  During  February  5--March  19,  a  total  of  33  (21%)  students  with  rash  illness
was reported in a rural 
elementary  school  with  161  students;  12  (36%)  of  the  33  affected  students  sought
medical care. The illnesses were mild and lasted 
a  median  of  4  days  (range:  6  hours--14  days).  Of  the  71  children  in  kindergarten
through fourth grade, 25 (35%) were 
affected. Most affected students had rashes limited to the hands and forearms, but five
(15%) children had rashes that were 
generalized or involved the face; five (15%) children had pruritic rashes. Dates of rash
onset were February 19 for six cases and 
February 28 for 12 cases; these 18 cases accounted for 55% of cases among students.
However, single cases continued to be reported 
as  late  as  March  19.  Of  the  33  cases  reported,  23  (70%)  occurred  among  girls.  Two
siblings developed rashes 4 days apart; 
no  other  rashes  among  family  members  were  reported  to  the  school  nurse.  Contact
dermatitis was the most likely explanation 
for  most  cases,  possibly  from  frequent  use  of  hand  cleaners  and  alcohol-based
sanitizers or from surfaces cleaned with 
ammonia-based  products.  Other  possible  etiologies  offered  by  clinicians  for  these
rashes included scabies, dry skin, and parvovirus 
B19 infection; however, none of these diagnoses was confirmed.
Public Health Response
Despite public perceptions that all rash cases are inter-related, even in a single school,
children's rashes can result from 
a variety of etiologies, including medications, dry or sensitive skin, eczema, allergies,
viral infections, and psychogenic 
or  environmental  factors.  Investigations  have  identified  cases  for  some  of  the  rashes
reported. In other cases, the etiology 
remains unknown.
CDC  is  continuing  to  monitor  reports  of  groups  of  schoolchildren  with  rashes  and  is
providing technical assistance to 
state  and  local  health  departments  investigating  these  reports.  In  addition,  CDC  is
receiving public inquiries from adults (with 
or  without  exposure  to  children)  who  suspect  they  might  have  a  related  rash.  These
public inquiries are forwarded to state 
or local health departments for follow-up.

Editorial Note:
 Rashes reported in schools have affected school policies and practices. Normal school
operations 
were disrupted when students were moved or evacuated from their classrooms, and the
costs of conducting 
environmental  assessments  have  added  a  financial  burden.  In  the  absence  of  an
identifiable etiology for the rashes, many 
school administrators and board members had to consider whether short-term school
closures were warranted and to decide 
if  children  with  rashes  should  be  excluded  from  school  or  if  children  without  rashes
should be permitted to stay home 
from school.
Schools that identify groups of students and/or staff with rashes should report cases to
their state or local health 
department to determine what kind of investigation should be conducted to ensure that
no identifiable hazards exist within the 
school setting. To assist with these efforts, CDC has developed and distributed to health
departments a document with 
suggested  approaches  for  investigating  reports  of  rashes  among  groups  of
schoolchildren. In particular, efforts should be made to 
1)  collect  uniform  information  from  affected  persons  so  cases  of  rashes  reportedly
associated with school settings can 
be differentiated from rashes occurring from other causes; 2) monitor reported cases to
ensure that the rashes have resolved; 
3)  determine  whether  similar  rashes  are  occurring  among  household  members  who
have not been exposed to the school 
setting; and 4) confirm that no other associated signs and symptoms are occurring or
developing subsequent to the rashes.
At  least  five  challenges  might  impede  the  investigation  of  reported  rashes  among
schoolchildren and the identification 
of the underlying causes. First, school mechanisms for reporting and tracking students'
health vary. Second, because many 
rashes are of short duration, health-care providers other than school nurses usually do
not observe them. Third, parents and 
health-care providers might be reluctant to collect biologic specimens that would assist
with determining an infectious etiology 
from  otherwise  healthy  children.  Fourth,  the  logistics  of  organizing  an  environmental
assessment can delay collection of timely 
and complete information. Finally, inconclusive and possibly misleading data might be
collected 
if a methodical environmental sampling plan is not followed 
(2).
When accompanied by other signs and symptoms, rashes can be an important indicator
of serious health 
conditions; however, few schoolchildren with rashes had any accompanying signs and
symptoms. The level of parental concern and 
media  attention  elicited  by  reports  of  rashes  among  schoolchildren  underscores  the
need for continuing investigation.

 Although rashes among schoolchildren are common, public concern has been growing
because of the number 
of  simultaneous  cases  reported  in  schools  across  the  United  States.  During  October
2001--May 2002, rashes among groups 
of  students  were  reported  in  approximately  110  U.S.  elementary,  middle,  and  high
schools. The number of students affected

Case Reports
New York. On March 8, 2002, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) sent
a notice to local health

of outbreaks of rash illness. At the 
time, NYSDOH and a county health department were following an ongoing outbreak of

and by April 2 involved 242 (7%) elementary- and middle-school students in a school
district with 3,371 children. No fevers 
or  other  major  signs  and  symptoms  were  reported  to  accompany  the  rashes,  and  no
rash illness was reported among 
employees in affected schools. To assess the outbreak, school nurses selected a sample
of affected students with active rashes from 
five  elementary  schools  and  one  middle  school;  17  children  with  rashes  were
interviewed on April 2 and evaluated by a team 
of health-care providers by physical examination, serology for parvovirus B19, and viral
cultures of throat and stool 
specimens. Dates of rash onset for these 17 children ranged from March 11 to April 1.
Of the 17 children interviewed, 12 (71%) 
were females. The ages of the students ranged from 5--13 years (mean: 9 years). Five
(29%) children reported having 
had symptoms (e.g., fatigue, stuffy nose, and sore throat) that occurred within 4 days

children who reported that another family member had a rash, four (67%) had family
members whose rashes occurred before 
the child's rash onset, and two  (33%) had family members whose onset followed the
child's rash. Fifteen (88%) children

school administrators and board members had to consider whether short-term school
closures were warranted and to decide 
if  children  with  rashes  should  be  excluded  from  school  or  if  children  without  rashes
should be permitted to stay home 
from school.
Schools that identify groups of students and/or staff with rashes should report cases to
their state or local health 
department to determine what kind of investigation should be conducted to ensure that
no identifiable hazards exist within the 
school setting. To assist with these efforts, CDC has developed and distributed to health
departments a document with 
suggested  approaches  for  investigating  reports  of  rashes  among  groups  of
schoolchildren. In particular, efforts should be made to 
1)  collect  uniform  information  from  affected  persons  so  cases  of  rashes  reportedly
associated with school settings can 
be differentiated from rashes occurring from other causes; 2) monitor reported cases to
ensure that the rashes have resolved; 
3)  determine  whether  similar  rashes  are  occurring  among  household  members  who
have not been exposed to the school 
setting; and 4) confirm that no other associated signs and symptoms are occurring or
developing subsequent to the rashes.
At  least  five  challenges  might  impede  the  investigation  of  reported  rashes  among
schoolchildren and the identification 
of the underlying causes. First, school mechanisms for reporting and tracking students'
health vary. Second, because many 
rashes are of short duration, health-care providers other than school nurses usually do
not observe them. Third, parents and 
health-care providers might be reluctant to collect biologic specimens that would assist
with determining an infectious etiology 
from  otherwise  healthy  children.  Fourth,  the  logistics  of  organizing  an  environmental
assessment can delay collection of timely 
and complete information. Finally, inconclusive and possibly misleading data might be
collected 
if a methodical environmental sampling plan is not followed 
(2).
When accompanied by other signs and symptoms, rashes can be an important indicator
of serious health 
conditions; however, few schoolchildren with rashes had any accompanying signs and
symptoms. The level of parental concern and 
media  attention  elicited  by  reports  of  rashes  among  schoolchildren  underscores  the
need for continuing investigation.

 New York. On March 8, 2002, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) sent
a notice to local health 
units and school superintendents across the state to increase awareness and reporting
of outbreaks of rash illness. At the 
time, NYSDOH and a county health department were following an ongoing outbreak of
rash illness, which began in January 
and by April 2 involved 242 (7%) elementary- and middle-school students in a school
district with 3,371 children. No fevers 
or  other  major  signs  and  symptoms  were  reported  to  accompany  the  rashes,  and  no
rash illness was reported among 
employees in affected schools. To assess the outbreak, school nurses selected a sample
of affected students with active rashes from 
five  elementary  schools  and  one  middle  school;  17  children  with  rashes  were
interviewed on April 2 and evaluated by a team 
of health-care providers by physical examination, serology for parvovirus B19, and viral
cultures of throat and stool 
specimens. Dates of rash onset for these 17 children ranged from March 11 to April 1.
Of the 17 children interviewed, 12 (71%) 
were females. The ages of the students ranged from 5--13 years (mean: 9 years). Five
(29%) children reported having 
had symptoms (e.g., fatigue, stuffy nose, and sore throat) that occurred within 4 days
before rash onset. Of six (35%) 
children who reported that another family member had a rash, four (67%) had family
members whose rashes occurred before 
the child's rash onset, and two  (33%) had family members whose onset followed the
child's rash. Fifteen (88%) children 
reported their rashes to be itchy; of these, nine (60%) children reported no association
with time of day or place. Three (18%) of 
the 17 children that were interviewed reported having a low-grade fever (i.e., <100.3º 
F [37.9º C]), nine (53%) children reported that the rashes were warm to the touch, eight
(47%) children associated the rashes with a burning sensation, and 13 
(77%) children reported that the rashes reappeared; information for one child was not
recorded. Five (29%) children had rashes 
that began on the face and nine (53%) children rashes that began on the extremities or
stomach before spreading; two 
(12%) children had rashes that did not spread. On examination, health-care providers
described the rashes as maculopapular in 
13  (77%)  cases,  lacy  and  reticular  in  14  (82%)  cases,  and  morbilliform  in  six  (35%)
cases. All 17 children submitted 
specimens for viral studies; 16 (94%) had negative viral throat cultures, and one was
positive for influenza A. Stool specimens 
were submitted by nine children; all were negative on viral culture. Human parvovirus
B19 antibody assays were performed on 
14 children; 13 (93%) were positive for IgM antibodies, and 14 (100%) were positive for
IgG antibodies. The results of 
this investigation support the conclusion that the outbreak was due to parvovirus B19,
which causes erythema infectiosum 
(i.e., fifth disease).
 Georgia. During January, the Georgia Division of Public Health received a report that 12
students from an 
elementary school had developed pruritic rashes in a single day; 10 children were in the
same class. Dermatologists who examined all 
12  children  diagnosed  the  rashes  as  contact  dermatitis.  The  rashes  resolved  by  the
next day, and no additional cases occurred. 
The school cleaned the classroom on the day the rashes occurred, including vacuuming
the carpet, washing table tops, and 
wet dusting all surfaces. The school nurse determined that the pruritic rashes were the
only sign or symptom; one child had 
a history of a preceding illness (a cold the previous week). The onset of rash illnesses
began after one child developed a 
pruritic eczematic rash on one arm. After several minutes, a second child complained
that her arm was itching; within the hour, 
eight  children  seated  at  the  same  table  also  were  scratching  their  arms  and
complaining about rashes. A child from 
another classroom reported a pruritic rash after sitting with the other children at lunch;
another child, also from another 
class,  reported  a  rash  after  seeing  the  index  child  in  the  school  clinic.  Although
environmental or allergic exposure cannot be 
ruled out, the school nurse's description suggests that all the rashes (with the exception
of the index case) were caused by 
scratching secondary to observing, encountering, or interacting with the child with the
eczematic rash.
 Missouri. During February 5--March 19, a total of 33 (21%) students with rash illness
was reported in a rural 
elementary  school  with  161  students;  12  (36%)  of  the  33  affected  students  sought
medical care. The illnesses were mild and lasted 
a  median  of  4  days  (range:  6  hours--14  days).  Of  the  71  children  in  kindergarten
through fourth grade, 25 (35%) were 
affected. Most affected students had rashes limited to the hands and forearms, but five
(15%) children had rashes that were 
generalized or involved the face; five (15%) children had pruritic rashes. Dates of rash
onset were February 19 for six cases and 
February 28 for 12 cases; these 18 cases accounted for 55% of cases among students.
However, single cases continued to be reported 
as  late  as  March  19.  Of  the  33  cases  reported,  23  (70%)  occurred  among  girls.  Two
siblings developed rashes 4 days apart; 
no  other  rashes  among  family  members  were  reported  to  the  school  nurse.  Contact
dermatitis was the most likely explanation 
for  most  cases,  possibly  from  frequent  use  of  hand  cleaners  and  alcohol-based
sanitizers or from surfaces cleaned with 
ammonia-based  products.  Other  possible  etiologies  offered  by  clinicians  for  these
rashes included scabies, dry skin, and parvovirus 
B19 infection; however, none of these diagnoses was confirmed.
Public Health Response
Despite public perceptions that all rash cases are inter-related, even in a single school,
children's rashes can result from 
a variety of etiologies, including medications, dry or sensitive skin, eczema, allergies,
viral infections, and psychogenic 
or  environmental  factors.  Investigations  have  identified  cases  for  some  of  the  rashes
reported. In other cases, the etiology 
remains unknown.
CDC  is  continuing  to  monitor  reports  of  groups  of  schoolchildren  with  rashes  and  is
providing technical assistance to 
state  and  local  health  departments  investigating  these  reports.  In  addition,  CDC  is
receiving public inquiries from adults (with 
or  without  exposure  to  children)  who  suspect  they  might  have  a  related  rash.  These
public inquiries are forwarded to state 
or local health departments for follow-up.

Editorial Note:
 Rashes reported in schools have affected school policies and practices. Normal school
operations 
were disrupted when students were moved or evacuated from their classrooms, and the

not observe them. Third, parents and 
health-care providers might be reluctant to collect biologic specimens that would assist
with determining an infectious etiology 
from  otherwise  healthy  children.  Fourth,  the  logistics  of  organizing  an  environmental
assessment can delay collection of timely 
and complete information. Finally, inconclusive and possibly misleading data might be
collected 
if a methodical environmental sampling plan is not followed 
(2).
When accompanied by other signs and symptoms, rashes can be an important indicator
of serious health 
conditions; however, few schoolchildren with rashes had any accompanying signs and
symptoms. The level of parental concern and 
media  attention  elicited  by  reports  of  rashes  among  schoolchildren  underscores  the
need for continuing investigation.

  Rashes reported in schools have affected school policies and practices. Normal school
operations 
were disrupted when students were moved or evacuated from their classrooms, and the
costs of conducting 
environmental  assessments  have  added  a  financial  burden.  In  the  absence  of  an
identifiable etiology for the rashes, many 
school administrators and board members had to consider whether short-term school
closures were warranted and to decide 
if  children  with  rashes  should  be  excluded  from  school  or  if  children  without  rashes
should be permitted to stay home 
from school.
 Schools that identify groups of students and/or staff with rashes should report cases to
their state or local health 
department to determine what kind of investigation should be conducted to ensure that
no identifiable hazards exist within the 
school setting. To assist with these efforts, CDC has developed and distributed to health
departments a document with 
suggested  approaches  for  investigating  reports  of  rashes  among  groups  of
schoolchildren. In particular, efforts should be made to 
1)  collect  uniform  information  from  affected  persons  so  cases  of  rashes  reportedly
associated with school settings can 
be differentiated from rashes occurring from other causes; 2) monitor reported cases to
ensure that the rashes have resolved; 
3)  determine  whether  similar  rashes  are  occurring  among  household  members  who
have not been exposed to the school 
setting; and 4) confirm that no other associated signs and symptoms are occurring or
developing subsequent to the rashes.
 At  least  five  challenges  might  impede  the  investigation  of  reported  rashes  among
schoolchildren and the identification 
of the underlying causes. First, school mechanisms for reporting and tracking students'
health vary. Second, because many 
rashes are of short duration, health-care providers other than school nurses usually do
not observe them. Third, parents and 
health-care providers might be reluctant to collect biologic specimens that would assist
with determining an infectious etiology 
from  otherwise  healthy  children.  Fourth,  the  logistics  of  organizing  an  environmental
assessment can delay collection of timely 
and complete information. Finally, inconclusive and possibly misleading data might be
collected 
if a methodical environmental sampling plan is not followed 
(2).
 When  accompanied  by  other  signs  and  symptoms,  rashes  can  be  an  important
indicator of serious health 
conditions; however, few schoolchildren with rashes had any accompanying signs and
symptoms. The level of parental concern and 
media  attention  elicited  by  reports  of  rashes  among  schoolchildren  underscores  the
need for continuing investigation.
