Precautions  Recommended  for  Selected  Infections  and  Conditions  from  the  Guideline
for  Isolation  Precautions:  Preventing  Transmission  of  Infectious  Agents  in  Healthcare
Settings (2007). Use Contact Precautions for a minimum of 48 hours after the resolution
of  symptoms  or  to  control  institutional  outbreaks.  Persons  who  clean  areas  heavily
contaminated with feces or vomitus may benefit from wearing masks since virus can be
aerosolized  from  these  body  substances  [142,  147  148];  ensure  consistent
environmental cleaning and disinfection with focus on restrooms even when apparently
unsoiled [273, 1064]. Hypochlorite solutions may be required when there is continued
transmission  [290-292].  Alcohol  is  less  active,  but  there  is  no  evidence  that  alcohol
antiseptic  handrubs  are  not  effective  for  hand  decontamination  [294].  Cohorting  of
affected  patients  to  separate  airspaces  and  toilet  facilities  may  help  interrupt
transmission  during  outbreaks.  Gastroenteritis,  Noroviruses  Precaution  Update  [April
2019]
Update: The Type of Precaution was updated from “Standard” to “Contact + Standard”
to  align  with  Guideline  for  the  Prevention  and  Control  of  Norovirus  Gastroenteritis
Outbreaks in Healthcare Settings (2011). Interim Measles Infection Control [July 2019]
 See  Interim  Infection  Prevention  and  Control  Recommendations  for  Measles  in
Healthcare  Settings     Update:  The  Healthcare  Infection  Control  Practices  Advisory
Committee (HICPAC) voted to change the recommendation of isolation for persons with
mumps  from  9  days  to  5  days  based  on  this  2008  MMWR  reportUpdated
Recommendations  for  Isolation  of  Persons  with  Mumps  (accessed  September  2018).
Single patient room preferred. Cohorting an option. Postexposure chemoprophylaxis for
household contacts and HCWs with prolonged exposure to respiratory secretions [863].
Recommendations  for  Tdap  vaccine  in  adults  under  development.  Tdap  Vaccine
Recommendations [2018] Update: Current recommendations can be found at Tdap / Td
ACIP  Vaccine  Recommendations  (accessed  September  2018).  See  Streptococcal
Disease  (group  A  Streptococcus)  below  Contact  Precautions  if  skin  lesions  present.
Susceptible  HCWs  should  not  enter  room  if  immune  caregivers  are  available.  No
recommendation  for  wearing  face  protection  (e.g.,  a  surgical  mask)  if  immune.
Pregnant  women  who  are  not  immune  should  not  care  for  these  patients  [17,  33].
Administer vaccine within 3 days of exposure to non-pregnant susceptible individuals.
Place  exposed  susceptible  patients  on  Droplet  Precautions;  exclude  susceptible
healthcare  personnel  from  duty  from  day  5  after  first  exposure  to  day  21  after  last
exposure,  regardless  of  postexposure  vaccine.  Airborne  preferred;  Droplet  if  AIIR
unavailable. N95 or higher respiratory protection; surgical mask if N95 unavailable; eye
protection  (goggles,  face  shield);  aerosol-generating  procedures  and  “supershedders”
highest  risk  for  transmission  via  small  droplet  nuclei  and  large  droplets  [93,  94,  96].

Respiratory  Syndrome  (SARS)  (accessed  September  2018).])  Contact  Precautions  for
draining  wound  as  above;  follow  recommendations  for  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  in
selected conditions [160]. Each of the 3 sputum specimens should be collected 8 -24
hours  apart,  and  at  least  1  should  be  an  early  morning  specimen.  Susceptible  HCWs
should not enter room if immune caregivers are available; no recommendation for face
protection  of  immune  HCWs;  no  recommendation  for  type  of  protection  (i.e.,  surgical
mask  or  respirator)  for  susceptible  HCWs.  In  immunocompromised  host  with  varicella
pneumonia,  prolong  duration  of  precautions  for  duration  of  illness.  Varicella
Post-exposure  Prophylaxis  Update  [April  2019]   Update:  Postexposure  prophylaxis:
provide  postexposure  vaccine  ASAP  but  within  120  hours;  for  susceptible  exposed
persons for whom vaccine is contraindicated (immunocompromised persons, pregnant
women, newborns whose mother’s varicella onset is <5 days before delivery or within
48  hours  after  delivery)  provide  varicella  zoster  immune  globulin  as  soon  as  possible
after exposure and within 10 days. Use Airborne for exposed susceptible persons and
exclude exposed susceptible healthcare workers beginning 8 days after first exposure
until  21  days  after  last  exposure  or  28  if  received  varicella  zoster  immune  globulin,
regardless  of  postexposure  vaccination.  [1036]  Ebola  Virus  Disease  for  Healthcare
Workers [2014]
