guide  to  assist  state  and  local  health  departments  in  conducting  waterborne  disease
outbreak investigations. CDC developed this toolkit to help partners address the unique
challenges they face when investigating waterborne disease outbreaks. Because of the
numerous  ways  in  which  water  impacts  every  person’s  daily  life,  timely  detection,
response,  and  control  of  these  outbreaks  are  crucial  to  protect  public  health.   Using
experiences of epidemiologists at the state and local levels, this toolkit describes best
practices  in  preparing  for,  identifying,  and  responding  to  a  waterborne  disease
outbreak.  Download the Waterborne Disease Outbreak Investigation Toolkit. [PDF – 36
pages]  For  outbreaks  related  to  recreational  water,  visit  CDC’s  Recreational  Water
Illness Outbreak Response Tools page. CDC is available to assist local, state, territorial,
and  tribal  health  departments—as  well  other  countries’  ministries  of  health—with
investigating and controlling waterborne disease outbreaks. The toolkit content can be
found by navigating through this website. It is also available as a PDF document [PDF –
36  pages].  To  receive  updates  highlighting  our  recent  work  to  prevent  infectious
