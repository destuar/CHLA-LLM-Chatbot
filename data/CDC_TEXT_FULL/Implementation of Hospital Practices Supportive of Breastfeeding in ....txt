Evidence-based hospital practices supporting breastfeeding have sometimes conflicted
with COVID-19 infection prevention and control measures. What is added by this report?
During summer 2020, hospitals implemented a variety of practices intended to balance
evidence-based  maternity  care  with  infection  prevention  and  control.  Because  of  the
pandemic, 17.9% of hospitals reported that in-person lactation support had decreased,
and 72.9% reported discharging mothers and their babies <48 hours after birth. What
are the implications for public health practice? Additional postdischarge breastfeeding
support  and  newborn  follow-up  might  be  needed  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.
Longer-term  monitoring  of  exclusive  breastfeeding  rates  at  hospital  discharge  will  be
important for assessing this aspect of the pandemic on infant health. Views equals page

infants  and  mothers  and  is  recommended  by  numerous  health  and  medical
organizations*,†  (1).  The  birth  hospitalization  is  a  critical  period  for  establishing
breastfeeding;
 however,
 some
 hospital
 practices,
 particularly
 related
 to
mother-newborn  contact,  have  given  rise  to  concern  about  the  potential  for
mother-to-newborn  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2,  the  virus  that  causes  coronavirus
disease  2019  (COVID-19)  (2).  CDC  conducted  a  COVID-19  survey  (July  15–August  20,
2020)  among  1,344  hospitals  that  completed  the  2018  Maternity  Practices  in  Infant
Nutrition  and  Care  (mPINC)  survey  to  assess  current  practices  and  breastfeeding
support while in the hospital. Among mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19,
14.0%  of  hospitals  discouraged  and  6.5%  prohibited  skin-to-skin  care;  37.8%
discouraged  and  5.3%  prohibited  rooming-in;  20.1%  discouraged  direct  breastfeeding
but allowed it if the mother chose; and 12.7% did not support direct breastfeeding, but
encouraged feeding of expressed breast milk. In response to the pandemic, 17.9% of
hospitals reported reduced in-person lactation support, and 72.9% reported discharging
mothers  and  their  newborns  <48  hours  after  birth.  Some  of  the  infection  prevention
and  control  (IPC)  practices  that  hospitals  were  implementing  conflicted  with
evidence-based  care  to  support  breastfeeding.  Mothers  who  are  separated  from  their
newborn  or  not  feeding  directly  at  the  breast  might  need  additional  postdischarge
breastfeeding  support.  In  addition,  the  American  Academy  of  Pediatrics  (AAP)
recommends that newborns discharged before 48 hours receive prompt follow-up with
a
 pediatric
 health
 care
 provider.
 Peripartum
 practices,
 including
 immediate
maternal-newborn  skin-to-skin  contact,  enabling  mothers  and  newborns  to  room-in
together,  and  teaching  mothers  to  breastfeed  (e.g.,  demonstrating  good  positioning
and attachment and supporting mothers to express breast milk if they are temporarily
separated  from  their  newborns),  are  recommended  worldwide  for  implementation  in
birth  hospitals  (3,4).  These  practices  have  a  positive  impact  on  both  short-  and
long-term  breastfeeding  outcomes,  which  in  turn  benefit  maternal  and  child  health
(5,6). Guidance on care during the birth hospitalization has evolved with the pandemic
and  at  times  has  varied  across  public  health  and  professional  medical  organizations.
CDC’s  mPINC  survey  is  a  census  of  all  birth  hospitals  in  the  United  States  and  its
territories.§ The 2,039 hospitals that completed the 2018 mPINC survey (70% response)
were  sent  an  e-mail  link  to  a  13-item  COVID-19  survey,  conducted  using  Research
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) (version 10.0.08; Vanderbilt University). The survey
was open during July 15–August 20, 2020 and asked about current hospital practices.
Maternity  services  had  been  closed  at  22  hospitals,  and  130  e-mailed  surveys  were
undeliverable  (i.e.,  e-mails  bounced  back).  Overall,  1,344  hospitals  completed  the
survey (66.6% overall response rate; 71.2% among delivered surveys). Hospitals were
asked  about  their  actual  or  planned  approach  to  managing  maternity  patients  with
suspected  or  confirmed  COVID-19  (as  defined  by  the  hospital),  and  the  approximate
number  of  these  patients  they  had  cared  for.  Descriptive  analyses  were  conducted
using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC and
was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.¶ Data on annual
births  and  hospital  type  were  obtained  from  the  2018  mPINC  survey.  Among  1,343
hospitals  with  available  information,  724  (53.9%)  had  cared  for  one  to  19  newborns
whose mothers had confirmed COVID-19; 152 (11.4%) had cared for 20 or more, and
457 (34.0%) had not cared for any (Table 1). Approximately one half of the hospitals
reported  fewer  than  1,000  annual  births,  42.0%  reported  1,000–4,999,  and  2.8%
reported 5,000 or more. The majority (78.8%) of hospitals were nonprofit. Among 1,344
birth hospitals, 1,211 (90.2%) reported having enough COVID-19 tests, and 864 (64.3%)
were performing universal COVID-19 testing of women admitted to labor and delivery
(Table 2). Few hospitals (4.8%) reported separating all mothers and newborns until the
mother received a negative test result, and 28.6% separated newborns and mothers if
the mother was symptomatic or had a known exposure until test results were obtained;
24.2%  separated  mothers  and  newborns  only  if  the  mother  received  a  positive  test
result. Overall, 178 (13.3%) hospitals encouraged skin-to-skin contact between mothers
with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their newborns immediately after birth, and
883 (66.1%) decided this on a case-by-case basis; 187 (14.0%) hospitals discouraged,
and  87  (6.5%)  prohibited  skin-to-skin  contact  between  mothers  with  suspected  or
confirmed  COVID-19  and  their  newborns.  Approximately  one  half  of  hospitals  (726;
54.4%) encouraged rooming-in for mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, with
precautions  to  maintain  distance,  whereas  504  (37.8%)  discouraged  and  70  (5.3%)
prohibited  rooming-in.  Approximately  two  thirds  of  hospitals  supported  direct
breastfeeding  with  precautions  (e.g.,  mask  use  and  handwashing)  for  mothers  with
suspected  or  confirmed  COVID-19  (893;  66.9%),  whereas  268  (20.1%)  discouraged
direct breastfeeding but would allow it according to mother’s choice, and 170 (12.7%)
did not support direct breastfeeding but encouraged expressed breast milk feeding by a
healthy  caregiver.  When  mothers  with  suspected  or  confirmed  COVID-19  were  not
breastfeeding directly, 438 (33.3%) hospitals reported supporting expression of breast
milk within 1 hour of birth, and 645 (49.0%) within 1–3 hours. Because of the COVID-19
pandemic,  239  (17.9%)  hospitals  reported  decreased  access  to  in-person  lactation
support  and  72.9%  discharged  mothers  and  newborns  <48  hours  after  birth.  After
discharge,  802  (59.7%)  and  655  (48.7%)  hospitals  offered  in-person  and  virtual
breastfeeding  consultations,  respectively.  Since  the  start  of  the  pandemic,  924
hospitals
 (68.9%)
 reported
 that
 their
 exclusive
 breastfeeding
 rates
 during
hospitalization had stayed about the same, and similar percentages reported increases
(11.3%),  compared  with  decreases  (12.2%).  Top  During  a  5-week  period  (July
15–August  20)  when  many  areas  of  the  country  were  experiencing  substantial
community  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2,  hospitals  were  implementing  a  variety  of
practices  intended  to  balance  evidence-based  maternity  care  with  COVID-19-related
IPC.  Hospital  practices  are  likely  evolving  along  with  the  pandemic  (7),  potentially
driven  by  multiple  factors,  including  level  of  community  transmission,  guidance  from
public health and medical professional organizations, and a hospital’s own experience
in preparation for or caring for pregnant women and newborns with COVID-19. Various
organizations have promulgated COVID-19 guidance on care for pregnant women and
newborns,  which  at  times  has  been  conflicting.  The  World  Health  Organization
recommends  that  mothers  with  COVID-19  be  able  to  practice  skin-to-skin  care,
rooming-in, and direct breastfeeding while wearing a mask, unless they are too ill to do
so**; similar guidance is supported by the American Academy of Family Physicians,††
and  the  American  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists§§  promotes  shared
decision-making with the mother and the health care team. On the other hand, when
this  survey  was  launched,  CDC  and  AAP  recommended  temporary  separation  of
newborns  from  mothers  with  suspected  or  confirmed  COVID-19  (8).  During  data
collection  for  this  survey,  CDC  (August  3¶¶)  and  AAP  (July  22***)  updated  their
guidance,  supporting  maternal  autonomy  in  decision-making.  Changes  in  guidance
reflect  evolving  knowledge  about  the  virus  and  its  potential  impact  on  newborns.  To
date,  there  has  been  no  definitive  evidence  of  transmission  of  SARS-CoV-2  through
breast milk. In addition, there have been reports of secretory immunoglobulin A against
SARS-CoV-2  in  breast  milk  samples  of  women  with  COVID-19,  suggesting  that
breastfeeding might be particularly important for newborns of mothers with COVID-19
(9). One third of hospitals in this study reported not having cared for any neonates born
to  mothers  with  COVID-19;  however,  others  had  extensive  experience,  including  17
hospitals reporting caring for at least 100 of these newborns. Follow-up of mothers with
COVID-19  delivering  at  three  large  New  York  birth  hospitals  found  reduced
breastfeeding rates both in the hospital and after returning home among mothers who
had been separated from their newborns (7). After identification of this finding, and the
observed stress among mothers and newborns as a result of separation, the hospital
system  revised  its  policy  and  began  to  allow  asymptomatic  mothers  with
laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 to room-in and breastfeed. Nearly one in five hospitals
in  this  study  reported  that  in-person  lactation  support  had  decreased  during  the
pandemic.  Approximately  60%  of  hospitals  in  this  study  reported  offering  in-person
breastfeeding  consultations  postdischarge,  compared  with  69%  of  hospitals  reporting
offering  this  in  the  2018  mPINC  survey  (CDC,  unpublished  data,  2020).  Lactation
specialists working in health care settings should follow recommended IPC measures for
those  settings.†††  Nearly  one  half  of  hospitals  reported  offering  virtual  breastfeeding
consultations;  however,  no  data  are  available  on  this  practice  before  the  pandemic.
Notably,  these  changes  in  lactation  support  affect  newborns  broadly,  not  just  those
born  to  mothers  with  COVID-19.  Approximately  equal  numbers  of  hospitals  reported
that  their  exclusive  breastfeeding  rates  had  increased  and  decreased;  the  majority
reported the rate had stayed approximately the same. The reasons for these changes
are unknown. However, the pandemic could contribute to reduced breastfeeding as a
result of maternal/newborn separation and reductions in lactation support. On the other
hand,  the  visitor  restriction  policies  implemented  by  many  hospitals  could  potentially
provide more opportunities for breastfeeding and for a mother to learn her newborn’s
feeding  cues.§§§  Longer-term  monitoring  of  exclusive  breastfeeding  rates  at  hospital
discharge will be important to assess as one measure of the impact of the pandemic on
infant  health.  Approximately  three  fourths  of  hospitals  reported  discharging  mothers
and their newborns <48 hours after birth because of the pandemic. No standard length
of  stay  for  the  birth  hospitalization  exists,  but  the  Newborn  Mothers’  Health  and
Protection Act of 1996 prohibits the restriction of benefits to <48 hours for a vaginal
delivery or <96 hours for a cesarean section.¶¶¶ AAP describes discharge <48 hours
after  delivery  as  a  “shortened  hospital  stay”  and  notes  that  although  it  can  be
accommodated  for  healthy  term  newborns,  it  is  not  appropriate  for  all  mothers  and
infants (10). AAP also recommends that all newborns discharged <48 hours after birth
be evaluated by a pediatric health care provider within 48 hours of discharge (10). This
visit,  in  part,  assesses  effective  feeding,  which  might  be  more  critical  during  the
pandemic  when  breastfeeding  mothers  might  be  receiving  reduced  hospital  lactation
support.  The  findings  in  this  report  are  subject  to  at  least  three  limitations.  First,
although  mPINC  is  a  census  of  all  birth  hospitals,  this  survey  was  only  sent  to  the
hospitals  that  completed  the  2018  mPINC  survey.  Second,  hospitals  used  their  own
definitions  for  suspected  and  confirmed  COVID-19,  and  those  definitions  might  have
been  different.  Finally,  data  captured  in  this  survey  represent  a  single  point  in  time.
Policies and practices likely will continue to change as the pandemic evolves. Women
with  suspected  or  confirmed  COVID-19  who  are  separated  from  their  newborns  and
whose newborns are not feeding directly at the breast might need timely, professional,
breastfeeding support.**** In addition, AAP advises that infants discharged <48 hours
after delivery receive prompt follow-up with a pediatric health care provider to ensure
optimal  feeding.  Top  Corresponding  author:  Cria  G.  Perrine,  cperrine@cdc.gov.  Top
