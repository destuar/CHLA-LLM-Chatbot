live in our air, soil, water and in and on our bodies. Some germs are helpful, others are
harmful.  An infection occurs when germs enter the body, increase in number and the
body  reacts.  Only  a  small  portion  of  germs  can  cause  infection.  For  an  infection  to
occur, germs must transmit to a person from a source, enter their body, invade tissues,
multiply  and  cause  a  reaction.  Healthcare  providers  can  perform  basic  infection
prevention  measures  to  prevent  infection.  There  are  2  tiers  of  recommended
precautions to prevent the spread of infections in healthcare settings: There are also
transmission- and germ-specific guidelines providers can follow to prevent transmission
and healthcare-associated infections from happening.  Learn more about how to protect
yourself  from  infections  in  healthcare  settings.  CDC  provides  information  on  infection
control  and  clinical  safety  to  help  reduce  the  risk  of  infections  among  healthcare
workers, patients, and visitors. Languages Language Assistance Languages  Language
