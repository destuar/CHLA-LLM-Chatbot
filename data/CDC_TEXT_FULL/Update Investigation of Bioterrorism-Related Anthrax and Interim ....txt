 Since October 3, 2001, CDC and state and local public health authorities have 
been investigating cases of bioterrorism-related anthrax. This report updates 
previous findings, provides new information on case investigations in two additional 
areas, presents the susceptibility patterns of Bacillus 
anthracis  isolates,  and  provides  interim  recommendations  for  managing  potential
threats and exposures and 
for treating anthrax. 
 As of October 24, investigations in the District of Columbia (DC), Florida, 
New Jersey, New York City (NYC), Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia have identified 
15 (11 confirmed and four suspected) cases of anthrax according to the CDC 
surveillance  case  definition  (1).  Seven  of  the  15  cases  were  inhalational  anthrax  and
eight 
were cutaneous. Of the seven inhalational cases, five occurred in postal workers in 
New Jersey and DC, and one in a person who sorted and distributed mail at a 
media company in Florida. Two letters mailed to two different recipients in NYC and one
letter mailed to a recipient in DC are known to have contained 
B. anthracis spores. Six cases were identified in employees of media companies; one
was a 7-month-old infant 
who visited a media company; and eight cases are consistent with exposures along 
the postal route of letters known to be contaminated with 
B. anthracis spores in New Jersey and DC. Using molecular typing, analysis of 
B. anthracis isolates from cases in Florida, NYC, and DC indicated that the isolates are
indistinguishable 
(2). Epidemiologic investigations and surveillance in other locations are continuing; 
no additional cases have been identified. 
Florida
As of October 24, investigations in Florida have identified two confirmed cases of 
 inhalational anthrax in persons who worked at the same media company; no 
additional cases of disease have been identified since the last report 
(1). A pleural biopsy for the second confirmed patient was positive for 
B. anthracis by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In addition, a >4-fold increase in
levels of serum antibody (IgG) to 
the protective antigen (PA) component of the anthrax toxin using 
enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was demonstrated.
Environmental sampling of the work site revealed 
B. anthracis contamination and implicated one or more mailed letters or packages as
the likely source of 
exposure. 
Several environmental specimens from regional and local postal centers that 
provided mail services to the work site were culture-positive for 
B. anthracis. Thirty postal workers had no evidence of 
B. anthracis exposure by nasal swab testing. No cases 
of disease have been identified among postal workers. On the basis of the 
positive environmental swabs, focused clean-up procedures continue at regional and 
local postal centers. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in consultation with 
health officials, is conducting decontamination of the work site.
Approximately 1,100 persons were started on antimicrobial prophylaxis 
for suspected B. anthracis exposure; 555 worked either full- or part-time in the 
affected building. The majority of other persons reported spending at least 1 hour in 
the affected building since August 1. Additional follow-up for compliance with 
prophylaxis recommendations and monitoring adverse events associated with 
long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis is ongoing. 
New York
Investigations in NYC have identified five (three confirmed and two 
suspected) cutaneous anthrax cases; three cases (one confirmed and two suspected)
have 
been identified since the last report (1). These five cases were associated with four 
media companies (A--D). The two previously reported cases were related to work sites A
and B, and the three additional cases were related to work sites C, D, and A, 
respectively. No cases among postal workers have been identified.
On October 1, a 27-year-old woman who regularly handled mail at work site 
C sought medical care at a local hospital for two lesions on the left cheek, 
which developed surrounding erythema and edema and local adenopathy. A biopsy 
obtained on October 16 was positive by IHC staining for the cell wall antigen of 
B.  anthracis  and  serologic  testing  was  weakly  reactive.  No  suspicious  letter  was
identified from 
her work site.
Two suspected cases of cutaneous anthrax also have been detected. The 
first suspected case, a 29-year-old woman with onset of illness on September 22, 
frequently handled mail at work site D. At her work site, an unopened letter 
postmarked September 18, which contained powder contaminated with 
B.  anthracis  was  found  on  October  19.  The  second  suspected  case,  a  23-year-old
woman with onset of illness 
on September 28, handled a suspicious letter postmarked September 18 from work site 
A. All three patients were treated with ciprofloxacin and have shown 
clinical improvement. A total of three persons were confirmed by nasal swabs to have 
been exposed to B. anthracis, presumably acquired during handling and processing 
of specimens during the investigation of the first confirmed case 
(1). 
In work site A, potentially exposed persons were identified and 
prescribed antimicrobial prophylaxis. An environmental investigation of work site A 
was conducted subsequently; environmental samples taken from work site A were 
culture-positive for B. anthracis. Of 1,360 persons who were tested by nasal swabs from
work site A, all were confirmed negative. Nasal swabs were obtained from 1,202 
persons from work sites B, C, and D; 1,183 tested negative and 19 are pending final 
results. Environmental samples taken from work site A were positive. Testing of 
environmental specimens from work sites B, C, and D is ongoing. 
Prophylaxis was recommended for potentially exposed persons at work site 
A. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was initiated for nine persons who had recent contact 
with the sealed letter containing B. 
anthracis in work site D. 
New Jersey
 To date, investigations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have identified four 
(two confirmed and two suspected) anthrax cases. Cutaneous disease has been 
diagnosed in three patients and one has illness suspected to be inhalational anthrax, 
but laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis are pending. All four of these 
patients worked at one of two postal facilities in New Jersey. Although no 
specific contaminated letter was identified, contaminated letters destined for both NYC
and 
DC passed through at least one of these postal facilities in New Jersey. 
On October 1, a 45-year-old female mail carrier sought medical care at a 
local hospital for a 4-day history of worsening skin lesions on her right forearm. A 
biopsy was obtained and arrived at CDC on October 17 and later that night was found 
positive by IHC. In addition, tissue was positive for 
B. anthracis by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), and serologic testing was reactive. The patient's condition improved 
on antimicrobial therapy. 
On October 16, a 35-year-old male mail processor, with a history of a 
chronic, bullous-like skin condition, was taken to a local hospital complaining of a 2-day 
history of a large pustular lesion on his neck. He returned 1 day later with 
increasing  ulceration  of  the  skin  lesion  associated  with  fatigue,  chills,  and  a  swollen
throat; 
he was afebile but had vesicles and bullae around the pustular lesion. Biopsy was 
positive by IHC, and serologic testing was reactive to 
B. anthracis. The patient's lesions responded to antimicrobial therapy. 
Two suspected cases also have been detected. The first case occurred in a 
39-year-old male machine mechanic who was taken to a local hospital on September 26
for two bullous, vesicular lesions with surrounding erythema, edema, and induration 
on the right forearm, which progressed to black eschars. The patient was treated 
for cellulitis with ceftriaxone followed by amoxicillin/clavulanate. The patient was 
reported to CDC on October 17 and serologic testing at CDC was reactive 
to B. anthracis. No biopsy was obtained. The patient's condition improved.
On October 14, the second suspected case occurred in a 56-year-old female 
postal worker who sought medical care for fever, diarrhea, and vomiting at a local 
hospital. On October 19, the patient was admitted to the hospital with chills, dry cough, 
and pleuritic chest pain. A chest radiograph showed a small right infiltrate and 
bilateral effusions, but no evidence of a widened mediastinum. The next day, her 
respiratory status and pleural effusions worsened. A chest computerized tomography 
(CT) showed an enlarged mediastinal and cervical lymph nodes without 
parenchymal disease. The pleural fluid was positive for 
B. anthracis by PCR. Bilateral pleural effusions have complicated the patient's hospital
course and she continues to 
require supplemental oxygen.
On October 20, the postal facility was closed; the New Jersey Department of 
Health and Senior Services recommended that postal workers at both postal facilities 
initiate antimicrobial prophylaxis pending further epidemiologic and 
environmental 
investigation. Both facilities have been closed pending results of further 
environmental  evaluation.  Environmental  sampling  is  being  conducted  at  both  postal
facilities. In 
one facility, 13 of 23 samples from high-risk areas were preliminarily culture-positive for
B. anthracis. Clean-up efforts are ongoing. Results of cultures from samples taken in 
the second facility and results from approximately 600 nasal swab cultures obtained 
from postal employees are pending. 
District of Columbia
To date, investigations in DC, Maryland, and Virginia have identified four 
confirmed anthrax cases. All patients had inhalational illness and all worked at a single 
postal facility in DC. 
On October 15, a staff member in the office of a U.S. Senator noted a small burst 
of dust released while opening a tightly sealed letter. The U.S. Capitol Police and 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were notified and the area was vacated and 
secured  immediately;  ventilation  systems  for  the  Senator's  offices  were  deactivated
within 
45 minutes of recognizing the threat. The letter and surrounding carpet were 
removed and sent for testing. On October 16, the letter tested positive for 
B.  anthracis  by  PCR,  and  an  epidemiologic  investigation  was  initiated  by  the  health
officials from the 
Office of Attending Physician, U.S. Capitol; DC Department of Health (DCDOH); 
Infectious Disease Service, National Naval Medical Center; and CDC.
Based on the initial investigation, the area of exposure was determined to 
consist of two floors in the southeast quadrant of the building where the U.S. Senator's 
office is located. Approximately 340 staff and visitors potentially were exposed. 
Beginning October 15, nasal swab testing was performed on these persons and 
approximately  5,000  additional  persons  who  referred  themselves  for  testing.
Twenty-eight 
persons  had  evidence  of  exposure  by  nasal  swab  testing;  13  were  in  the  immediate
office 
space where the letter was opened, nine were in adjacent areas, and six were 
first responders. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered to persons from the area 
of exposure and first-responders to the incident. Environmental specimens 
were collected at the affected building and other buildings in the U.S. Capitol complex. 
To date, environmental specimens are positive from the area of exposure as well as 
two mail rooms in the U.S. Capitol complex; one of the mail rooms did not process 
the contaminated letter. None of the mail room personnel and none of the postal 
workers at the post office serving the mail rooms had positive nasal swabs. These 
mail handlers were all offered prophylactic antibiotics. Initially, a single 
positive environmental sample for the post office serving these mail rooms was 
positive.  Subsequent  samples  from  this  post  office  and  the  mail  distribution  center
serving 
this post office were positive.
On October 19, enhanced regional surveillance activities (a collaborative 
effort between DCDOH, Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and 
the Virginia Department of Health) identified a case of pulmonary illness in a 
postal worker. The postal worker, a 56-year-old man, sought medical care at a 
Virginia  hospital  for  fever,  chills,  chest  heaviness,  malaise,  and  minimally  productive
cough 
of 3 days' duration. Initial evaluation in the emergency department (ED) revealed 
a widened mediastinum on a chest radiograph; a subsequent CT scan 
revealed  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy  and  small,  bilateral  pleural  effusions.  The
patient 
was hospitalized for suspected inhalational anthrax and was treated with broad 
spectrum
 antimicrobial
 agents,
 including
 ciprofloxacin.
 Blood
 cultures
 grew
gram-positive 
rods 
within 15 hours of collection, later confirmed to be 
B. anthracis at the Virginia State Health Laboratory and CDC on October 21. The patient
is clinically stable and 
remains hospitalized. 
On October 20, a second postal worker, also a 56-year-old man, who worked at 
the same distribution center, was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history 
of progressively worsening headache and night sweats. He had no fever, stiff neck, 
or other symptoms or signs consistent with meningitis. He had a mild sore throat 
and occasional dry cough. Because the patient was linked epidemiologically to the 
index case of inhalational anthrax, a chest radiograph and chest CT scan were 
performed that revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a right middle lobe 
infiltrate. Antimicrobial therapy was initiated. Blood cultures grew 
B. anthracis within 18 hours. The patient is clinically stable and remains hospitalized. 
On October 21, a third postal worker, a 55-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially sought medical care at a physician's office on October
18 for 
2 days of progressive fatigue, myalgias, and fever. The patient had a temperature of 
102 F (38.9 C) and normal white blood cell count and was sent home. The patient 
returned to the ED on October 21 with persistent symptoms, including chills, vague 
chest tightness, and temperature of 102 F (38.9 C). Chest radiograph revealed right 
middle and lower lobe alveolar infiltrates and right hilar and peritracheal soft tissue 
fullness. Evaluation revealed hypoxia, leukocytosis, and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial therapy was initiated, and the patient was mechanically ventilated. The 
patient's condition deteriorated, and he died on October 21. Blood cultures obtained 
on admission to the hospital grew gram-positive bacilli, which were confirmed later as 
B. anthracis at CDC. 
On October 22, a fourth postal worker, a 47-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially presented to the ED on October 21 with complaints of
5 
days of progressive fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and syncope. The patient 
was afebrile and had orthostatic hypotension. A chest radiograph was obtained 
and reported to be normal. The patient received intravenous fluids and was discharged.
He returned to the ED 26 hours later following another syncopal episode and 
persistent
 gastrointestinal
 complaints.
 The
 patient
 was
 afebrile,
 hypotensive,
diaphoretic, and 
in respiratory distress. A second chest radiograph and a chest CT revealed 
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions. Subsequent review of the
first 
chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined area of increased density in the right subhilar 
region. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial  therapy  was  initiated,  and  the  patient  was  mechanically  ventilated.
Peripheral 
blood smear demonstrated gram-positive bacilli; blood cultures grew gram-positive 
bacilli within 18 hours and were confirmed as B. 
anthracis at CDC. The patient died on October 22.
On October 20, CDC and DCDOH initiated an investigation of the postal 
facility where the four patients were employed. Although no specific exposure event 
was identified, the contaminated tightly sealed letter that was mailed to the Senator's 
office was processed at this facility on October 12 before entering the Capitol 
mail distribution system. The postal facility was closed on October 21, and 
antimicrobial prophylaxis was recommended to employees working in proximity to the
same 
mail sorting area of the first patient. In addition, visitors to nonpublic operations areas 
of 
this facility also were offered antimicrobial prophylaxis.
On October 22, because of concern about the potential for unrecognized 
aerosol exposures among postal workers, antimicrobial therapy was recommended for 
all workers and visitors to nonpublic areas in this postal facility. Subsequently, 
this recommendation has been extended to all postal workers in the DC area 
directly served by this postal facility pending results of ongoing epidemiologic 
and environmental investigation.
The first patient also worked at a second postal facility. On October 21, this 
facility also was closed. Antimicrobial prophylaxis also was recommended for workers at
this facility pending further epidemiologic and environmental testing. 
Susceptibility Testing of B. anthracis Isolates
Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined for 11 
B. anthracis isolates associated with intentional exposures in Florida, NYC, and DC. 
Susceptibility  breakpoints  for  interpreting  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)
results for 
B. anthracis have not been determined by the National Committee for Clinical 
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS); thus, breakpoints for staphylococci were used 
(3). All B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL), doxycycline 
(MIC<0.03 µg/mL), chloramphenicol (MIC=4 µg/mL), clindamycin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), tetracycline (MIC=0.06 µg/mL), rifampin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), and vancomycin (MIC=1--2 
µg/mL). Limited testing of imipenem suggests that these organisms are also susceptible
to 
this agent (MIC<0.12 µg/mL) and are likely susceptible to meropenem. Susceptibility of 
the isolates was considered intermediate to erythromycin (MIC=1 µg/mL) and 
borderline susceptible to azithromycin (MIC=2 µg/mL); clarithromycin was 
considered susceptible (MIC=0.25 µg/mL). 
B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC range: 
<0.06 ug/mL--0.12 µg/mL) and amoxicillin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL); ceftriaxone (MIC=16) was 
considered intermediate. NCCLS has not defined either a 
B.  anthracis  or  staphylococcal  interpretive  breakpoint  for  ceftriaxone  results;  thus,
breakpoints for 
gram-negative organisms were used to interpret ceftriaxone results. These ceftriaxone
MICs 
and additional laboratory data at CDC indicate the presence in 
B.  anthracis  isolates  of  a  cephalosporinase,  an  enzyme  that  inhibits  the  antibacterial
activity of 
cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone. Additional studies were performed with some of the
B.  anthracis  isolates  to  identify  other  beta-lactamases,  the  general  class  of  enzymes
that 
inactivate  penicillins,  cephalosporins,  and  related  drugs.  These  preliminary  studies
indicate 
the presence of a class B cephalosporinase and suggest that a penicillinase also may 
be present. These enzymes often are present in naturally occurring 
B. anthracis isolates.
This information is current as of October 24, 2001, 9 p.m. eastern daylight 
time. Intensive surveillance activities and environmental and case investigations are 
in progress to identify and treat all U.S. Postal Service workers and others at 
potential risk for anthrax. Surveillance also is being conducted to monitor adverse 
events  associated  with  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  for  anthrax.  CDC  and  FBI  are
collaborating 
to accelerate all aspects of the investigation surrounding these events.

Editorial Note:
 Bioterrorism attacks using 
B. anthracis spores sent through the mail have resulted in 15 anthrax cases and three
deaths. The initial anthrax cases 
occurred  among  persons  with  known  or  suspected  contact  with  opened  letters
contaminated 
with B. anthracis spores. Later, investigations identified four confirmed cases and 
one suspected case among postal workers who had no known contact with 
contaminated opened letters. This suggests that sealed envelopes contaminated with 
B.  anthracis  passing  through  the  postal  system  may  be  the  source  of  exposure.  The
number 
of contaminated envelopes passing through the postal system is not known. In 
addition, automated sorting could damage envelopes and release spores into postal 
environments; other circumstances that could contribute to the contamination of postal
facility environments may be identified. 
Because these cases are the result of intentional exposures, FBI and other 
law enforcement authorities are investigating these events as criminal acts and 
are working to identify and eliminate the source of these exposures. Until that occurs, 
the possibility of further exposure to B. 
anthracis and subsequent clinical illness 
exists. Clinicians and laboratorians should be vigilant for symptoms or laboratory 
findings  that  indicate  B.  anthracis  infection,  particularly  among  mail  handlers.

Managing Threats
Letters containing B. anthracis spores have been sent to persons in NYC and 
DC. Prompt identification of a threat and institution of appropriate measures may 
prevent inhalational anthrax. To prevent exposure to 
B.  anthracis  and  subsequent  infection,  suspicious  letters  or  packages  should  be
recognized and appropriate protective 
steps taken. 
Characteristics of suspicious packages and letters include inappropriate or 
unusual labeling, strange return address or no return address, postmarks from a city or 
state different from the return address, excessive packaging material, and others. If 
a package appears suspicious, it should not be opened. The package should be 
handled as little as possible. The room should be vacated and secured promptly 
and appropriate security or law enforcement agencies promptly notified (Box 1).
Managing Exposures
Identification of a patient with anthrax or a confirmed exposure to 
B.  anthracis  should  prompt  an  epidemiologic  investigation.  The  highest  priority  is  to
identify 
at-risk persons and initiate appropriate interventions to protect them. The 
exposure circumstances are the most important factors that direct decisions about 
prophylaxis. Persons with an exposure or contact with an item or environment known, 
or suspected to be contaminated with B. 
anthracis---regardless  of  laboratory  tests  results---should  be  offered  antimicrobial
prophylaxis.  Exposure or contact, 
not laboratory test results, is the basis for initiating such treatment. Culture of nasal 
swabs is used to detect anthrax spores. Nasal swabs can occasionally document 
exposure, but cannot rule out exposure to B. 
anthracis. As an adjunct to epidemiologic evaluations, nasal swabs may provide clues to
help assess the 
exposure circumstances. In addition, rapid evaluation of contaminated powder, 
including particle size and characteristics, may prove useful in assessing the risk for 
inhalational anthrax.
CDC is working with U.S. Postal Service employees and managers on 
several strategies to address the risk for anthrax among workers involved in mail 
handling. These strategies include personal protective equipment for workers handling
mail 
and engineering controls in mail facilities. Clinicians and laboratorians should be 
vigilant for symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate possible anthrax 
infection,  particularly  among  workers  involved  in  mail  sorting  and  distribution.

Antimicrobial Treatment
A high index of clinical suspicion and rapid administration of effective 
antimicrobial  therapy  is  essential  for  prompt  diagnosis  and  effective  treatment  of
anthrax. 
Limited clinical experience is available and no controlled trials in humans have been 
performed  to  validate  current  treatment  recommendations  for  inhalational  anthrax.
Based 
on studies in nonhuman primates and other animal and 
in vitro data, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline should be used for initial intravenous therapy
until 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  results  are  known  (Table  1).  Because  of  the  mortality
associated 
with inhalational anthrax, two or more antimicrobial agents predicted to be effective 
are recommended; however, controlled studies to support a multiple drug approach 
are not available. Other agents with in vitro activity suggested for use in conjunction 
with 
ciprofloxacin or doxycycline include rifampin, vancomycin, 
imipenem, chloramphenicol, penicillin and ampicillin, clindamycin, and clarithromycin;
but 
other than for penicillin, limited or no data exist regarding the use of these agents in 
the treatment of inhalational B. anthracis infection. Cephalosorins and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for therapy. Regimens being used to
treat patients described in this report include ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and vancomycin; 
and ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and clindamycin. 
Penicillin is labelled for use to treat inhalational anthrax. However, preliminary 
data indicate the presence of constitutive and inducible beta-lactamases in the 
B. anthracis isolates from Florida, NYC, and DC. Thus, treatment of systemic 
B.  anthracis  infection  using  a  penicillin  alone  (i.e.,  penicillin  G  and  ampicillin)  is  not
recommended. The 
B. anthracis genome sequence shows that this organism encodes two 
beta-lactamases:  a  penicillinase  and  a  cephalosporinase.  Data  in  the  literature  also
show that some 
beta-lactamase negative B. anthracis strains for which the penicillin MICs are 0.06 
µg/mL increase to 64 µg/mL and become beta-lactamase positive when exposed 
to semisynthetic penicillins (4). The frequency of this induction event is 
unknown.  Although  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  is  more  active  than  amoxicillin  alone
against 
beta-lactamase, producing strains in vitro, the combination may not be clinically 
effective  for  inhalational  anthrax  where  large  numbers  of  organisms  are  likely  to  be
present. 
Toxin-mediated morbidity is a major complication of systemic 
anthrax. Corticosteroids have been suggested as adjunct therapy for inhalational 
anthrax associated with extensive edema, respiratory compromise, and meningitis 
(5).
For cutaneous anthrax, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline also are first-line 
therapy  (Table  2).  As  for  inhalational  disease,  intravenous  therapy  with  a  multidrug
regimen 
is recommended for cutaneous anthrax with signs of systemic involvement, 
for extensive edema, or for lesions on the head and neck (Table 2). In cutaneous 
anthrax, antimicrobial treatment may render lesions culture negative in 24 hours, 
although progression to eschar formation still occurs 
(5). Some experts recommend that corticosteroids be considered for extensive edema
or swelling of the head and 
neck region associated with cutaneous anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is typically treated
for 
7--10 days; however, in this bioterrorism attack, the risk for simultaneous 
aerosol exposure appears to be high. Although infection may produce an effective 
immune response, a potential for reactivation of latent infection may exist. Therefore, 
persons  with  cutaneous  anthrax  associated  with  this  attack  should  be  treated  for  60
days.
Prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax exposure has been addressed in a 
previous report (1) and indicates the use of either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as first 
line agents. High-dose penicillin (e.g., amoxicillin or penicillin VK) may be an option 
for antimicrobial prophylaxis when ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are contraindicated. 
The likelihood of beta-lactamase induction events that would increase the penicillin MIC
is lower when only small numbers of vegetative cells are present, such as 
during antimicrobial prophylaxis. 
All medications may have undesirable side effects and allergic reactions may 
result from any medication. Clinicians prescribing these medications should be aware 
of their side effects and consult an infectious disease specialist as needed. 
Patients 
should be urged to inform their health-care provider of any adverse event.
This is the first bioterrorism-related anthrax attack in the United States, and 
the public health ramifications of this attack continue to evolve. Additional updates 
and recommendations will be published in 
MMWR.

    to examine it.
  Put the package or envelope on a stable surface; do not sniff, touch,
    taste, or look closely at it or any contents that may have spilled.
  Alert others in the area about the suspicious package or envelope. Leave
    the area, close any doors, and take actions to prevent others from entering
    the area. If possible, shut off the ventilation system.
  Wash hands with soap and water to prevent spreading potentially infectious
    material to face or skin. Seek additional instructions for exposed or
    potentially exposed persons.
  If at work, notify a supervisor, a security officer, or a law enforcement
    official. If at home, contact the local law enforcement agency.
  If possible, create a list of persons who were in the room or area when
    this suspicious letter or package was recognized and a list of persons who
    also may have handled this package or letter. Give the list to both the

 As of October 24, investigations in Florida have identified two confirmed cases of 
 inhalational anthrax in persons who worked at the same media company; no 
additional cases of disease have been identified since the last report 
(1). A pleural biopsy for the second confirmed patient was positive for 
B. anthracis by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In addition, a >4-fold increase in
levels of serum antibody (IgG) to 
the protective antigen (PA) component of the anthrax toxin using 
enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was demonstrated.
 Environmental sampling of the work site revealed 
B. anthracis contamination and implicated one or more mailed letters or packages as
the likely source of 
exposure. 
Several environmental specimens from regional and local postal centers that 
provided mail services to the work site were culture-positive for 
B. anthracis. Thirty postal workers had no evidence of 
B. anthracis exposure by nasal swab testing. No cases 
of disease have been identified among postal workers. On the basis of the 
positive environmental swabs, focused clean-up procedures continue at regional and 
local postal centers. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in consultation with 
health officials, is conducting decontamination of the work site.
 Approximately 1,100 persons were started on antimicrobial prophylaxis 
for suspected B. anthracis exposure; 555 worked either full- or part-time in the 
affected building. The majority of other persons reported spending at least 1 hour in 
the affected building since August 1. Additional follow-up for compliance with 
prophylaxis recommendations and monitoring adverse events associated with 
long-term antimicrobial prophylaxis is ongoing. 
New York
Investigations in NYC have identified five (three confirmed and two 
suspected) cutaneous anthrax cases; three cases (one confirmed and two suspected)
have 
been identified since the last report (1). These five cases were associated with four 
media companies (A--D). The two previously reported cases were related to work sites A
and B, and the three additional cases were related to work sites C, D, and A, 
respectively. No cases among postal workers have been identified.
On October 1, a 27-year-old woman who regularly handled mail at work site 
C sought medical care at a local hospital for two lesions on the left cheek, 
which developed surrounding erythema and edema and local adenopathy. A biopsy 
obtained on October 16 was positive by IHC staining for the cell wall antigen of 
B.  anthracis  and  serologic  testing  was  weakly  reactive.  No  suspicious  letter  was
identified from 
her work site.
Two suspected cases of cutaneous anthrax also have been detected. The 
first suspected case, a 29-year-old woman with onset of illness on September 22, 
frequently handled mail at work site D. At her work site, an unopened letter 
postmarked September 18, which contained powder contaminated with 
B.  anthracis  was  found  on  October  19.  The  second  suspected  case,  a  23-year-old
woman with onset of illness 
on September 28, handled a suspicious letter postmarked September 18 from work site 
A. All three patients were treated with ciprofloxacin and have shown 
clinical improvement. A total of three persons were confirmed by nasal swabs to have 
been exposed to B. anthracis, presumably acquired during handling and processing 
of specimens during the investigation of the first confirmed case 
(1). 
In work site A, potentially exposed persons were identified and 
prescribed antimicrobial prophylaxis. An environmental investigation of work site A 
was conducted subsequently; environmental samples taken from work site A were 
culture-positive for B. anthracis. Of 1,360 persons who were tested by nasal swabs from
work site A, all were confirmed negative. Nasal swabs were obtained from 1,202 
persons from work sites B, C, and D; 1,183 tested negative and 19 are pending final 
results. Environmental samples taken from work site A were positive. Testing of 
environmental specimens from work sites B, C, and D is ongoing. 
Prophylaxis was recommended for potentially exposed persons at work site 
A. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was initiated for nine persons who had recent contact 
with the sealed letter containing B. 
anthracis in work site D. 
New Jersey
 To date, investigations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have identified four 
(two confirmed and two suspected) anthrax cases. Cutaneous disease has been 
diagnosed in three patients and one has illness suspected to be inhalational anthrax, 
but laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis are pending. All four of these 
patients worked at one of two postal facilities in New Jersey. Although no 
specific contaminated letter was identified, contaminated letters destined for both NYC
and 
DC passed through at least one of these postal facilities in New Jersey. 
On October 1, a 45-year-old female mail carrier sought medical care at a 
local hospital for a 4-day history of worsening skin lesions on her right forearm. A 
biopsy was obtained and arrived at CDC on October 17 and later that night was found 
positive by IHC. In addition, tissue was positive for 
B. anthracis by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), and serologic testing was reactive. The patient's condition improved 
on antimicrobial therapy. 
On October 16, a 35-year-old male mail processor, with a history of a 
chronic, bullous-like skin condition, was taken to a local hospital complaining of a 2-day 
history of a large pustular lesion on his neck. He returned 1 day later with 
increasing  ulceration  of  the  skin  lesion  associated  with  fatigue,  chills,  and  a  swollen
throat; 
he was afebile but had vesicles and bullae around the pustular lesion. Biopsy was 
positive by IHC, and serologic testing was reactive to 
B. anthracis. The patient's lesions responded to antimicrobial therapy. 
Two suspected cases also have been detected. The first case occurred in a 
39-year-old male machine mechanic who was taken to a local hospital on September 26
for two bullous, vesicular lesions with surrounding erythema, edema, and induration 
on the right forearm, which progressed to black eschars. The patient was treated 
for cellulitis with ceftriaxone followed by amoxicillin/clavulanate. The patient was 
reported to CDC on October 17 and serologic testing at CDC was reactive 
to B. anthracis. No biopsy was obtained. The patient's condition improved.
On October 14, the second suspected case occurred in a 56-year-old female 
postal worker who sought medical care for fever, diarrhea, and vomiting at a local 
hospital. On October 19, the patient was admitted to the hospital with chills, dry cough, 
and pleuritic chest pain. A chest radiograph showed a small right infiltrate and 
bilateral effusions, but no evidence of a widened mediastinum. The next day, her 
respiratory status and pleural effusions worsened. A chest computerized tomography 
(CT) showed an enlarged mediastinal and cervical lymph nodes without 
parenchymal disease. The pleural fluid was positive for 
B. anthracis by PCR. Bilateral pleural effusions have complicated the patient's hospital
course and she continues to 
require supplemental oxygen.
On October 20, the postal facility was closed; the New Jersey Department of 
Health and Senior Services recommended that postal workers at both postal facilities 
initiate antimicrobial prophylaxis pending further epidemiologic and 
environmental 
investigation. Both facilities have been closed pending results of further 
environmental  evaluation.  Environmental  sampling  is  being  conducted  at  both  postal
facilities. In 
one facility, 13 of 23 samples from high-risk areas were preliminarily culture-positive for
B. anthracis. Clean-up efforts are ongoing. Results of cultures from samples taken in 
the second facility and results from approximately 600 nasal swab cultures obtained 
from postal employees are pending. 
District of Columbia
To date, investigations in DC, Maryland, and Virginia have identified four 
confirmed anthrax cases. All patients had inhalational illness and all worked at a single 
postal facility in DC. 
On October 15, a staff member in the office of a U.S. Senator noted a small burst 
of dust released while opening a tightly sealed letter. The U.S. Capitol Police and 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were notified and the area was vacated and 
secured  immediately;  ventilation  systems  for  the  Senator's  offices  were  deactivated
within 
45 minutes of recognizing the threat. The letter and surrounding carpet were 
removed and sent for testing. On October 16, the letter tested positive for 
B.  anthracis  by  PCR,  and  an  epidemiologic  investigation  was  initiated  by  the  health
officials from the 
Office of Attending Physician, U.S. Capitol; DC Department of Health (DCDOH); 
Infectious Disease Service, National Naval Medical Center; and CDC.
Based on the initial investigation, the area of exposure was determined to 
consist of two floors in the southeast quadrant of the building where the U.S. Senator's 
office is located. Approximately 340 staff and visitors potentially were exposed. 
Beginning October 15, nasal swab testing was performed on these persons and 
approximately  5,000  additional  persons  who  referred  themselves  for  testing.
Twenty-eight 
persons  had  evidence  of  exposure  by  nasal  swab  testing;  13  were  in  the  immediate
office 
space where the letter was opened, nine were in adjacent areas, and six were 
first responders. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered to persons from the area 
of exposure and first-responders to the incident. Environmental specimens 
were collected at the affected building and other buildings in the U.S. Capitol complex. 
To date, environmental specimens are positive from the area of exposure as well as 
two mail rooms in the U.S. Capitol complex; one of the mail rooms did not process 
the contaminated letter. None of the mail room personnel and none of the postal 
workers at the post office serving the mail rooms had positive nasal swabs. These 
mail handlers were all offered prophylactic antibiotics. Initially, a single 
positive environmental sample for the post office serving these mail rooms was 
positive.  Subsequent  samples  from  this  post  office  and  the  mail  distribution  center
serving 
this post office were positive.
On October 19, enhanced regional surveillance activities (a collaborative 
effort between DCDOH, Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and 
the Virginia Department of Health) identified a case of pulmonary illness in a 
postal worker. The postal worker, a 56-year-old man, sought medical care at a 
Virginia  hospital  for  fever,  chills,  chest  heaviness,  malaise,  and  minimally  productive
cough 
of 3 days' duration. Initial evaluation in the emergency department (ED) revealed 
a widened mediastinum on a chest radiograph; a subsequent CT scan 
revealed  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy  and  small,  bilateral  pleural  effusions.  The
patient 
was hospitalized for suspected inhalational anthrax and was treated with broad 
spectrum
 antimicrobial
 agents,
 including
 ciprofloxacin.
 Blood
 cultures
 grew
gram-positive 
rods 
within 15 hours of collection, later confirmed to be 
B. anthracis at the Virginia State Health Laboratory and CDC on October 21. The patient
is clinically stable and 
remains hospitalized. 
On October 20, a second postal worker, also a 56-year-old man, who worked at 
the same distribution center, was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history 
of progressively worsening headache and night sweats. He had no fever, stiff neck, 
or other symptoms or signs consistent with meningitis. He had a mild sore throat 
and occasional dry cough. Because the patient was linked epidemiologically to the 
index case of inhalational anthrax, a chest radiograph and chest CT scan were 
performed that revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a right middle lobe 
infiltrate. Antimicrobial therapy was initiated. Blood cultures grew 
B. anthracis within 18 hours. The patient is clinically stable and remains hospitalized. 
On October 21, a third postal worker, a 55-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially sought medical care at a physician's office on October
18 for 
2 days of progressive fatigue, myalgias, and fever. The patient had a temperature of 
102 F (38.9 C) and normal white blood cell count and was sent home. The patient 
returned to the ED on October 21 with persistent symptoms, including chills, vague 
chest tightness, and temperature of 102 F (38.9 C). Chest radiograph revealed right 
middle and lower lobe alveolar infiltrates and right hilar and peritracheal soft tissue 
fullness. Evaluation revealed hypoxia, leukocytosis, and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial therapy was initiated, and the patient was mechanically ventilated. The 
patient's condition deteriorated, and he died on October 21. Blood cultures obtained 
on admission to the hospital grew gram-positive bacilli, which were confirmed later as 
B. anthracis at CDC. 
On October 22, a fourth postal worker, a 47-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially presented to the ED on October 21 with complaints of
5 
days of progressive fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and syncope. The patient 
was afebrile and had orthostatic hypotension. A chest radiograph was obtained 
and reported to be normal. The patient received intravenous fluids and was discharged.
He returned to the ED 26 hours later following another syncopal episode and 
persistent
 gastrointestinal
 complaints.
 The
 patient
 was
 afebrile,
 hypotensive,
diaphoretic, and 
in respiratory distress. A second chest radiograph and a chest CT revealed 
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions. Subsequent review of the
first 
chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined area of increased density in the right subhilar 
region. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial  therapy  was  initiated,  and  the  patient  was  mechanically  ventilated.
Peripheral 
blood smear demonstrated gram-positive bacilli; blood cultures grew gram-positive 
bacilli within 18 hours and were confirmed as B. 
anthracis at CDC. The patient died on October 22.
On October 20, CDC and DCDOH initiated an investigation of the postal 
facility where the four patients were employed. Although no specific exposure event 
was identified, the contaminated tightly sealed letter that was mailed to the Senator's 
office was processed at this facility on October 12 before entering the Capitol 
mail distribution system. The postal facility was closed on October 21, and 
antimicrobial prophylaxis was recommended to employees working in proximity to the
same 
mail sorting area of the first patient. In addition, visitors to nonpublic operations areas 
of 
this facility also were offered antimicrobial prophylaxis.
On October 22, because of concern about the potential for unrecognized 
aerosol exposures among postal workers, antimicrobial therapy was recommended for 
all workers and visitors to nonpublic areas in this postal facility. Subsequently, 
this recommendation has been extended to all postal workers in the DC area 
directly served by this postal facility pending results of ongoing epidemiologic 
and environmental investigation.
The first patient also worked at a second postal facility. On October 21, this 
facility also was closed. Antimicrobial prophylaxis also was recommended for workers at
this facility pending further epidemiologic and environmental testing. 
Susceptibility Testing of B. anthracis Isolates
Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined for 11 
B. anthracis isolates associated with intentional exposures in Florida, NYC, and DC. 
Susceptibility  breakpoints  for  interpreting  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)
results for 
B. anthracis have not been determined by the National Committee for Clinical 
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS); thus, breakpoints for staphylococci were used 
(3). All B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL), doxycycline 
(MIC<0.03 µg/mL), chloramphenicol (MIC=4 µg/mL), clindamycin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), tetracycline (MIC=0.06 µg/mL), rifampin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), and vancomycin (MIC=1--2 
µg/mL). Limited testing of imipenem suggests that these organisms are also susceptible
to 
this agent (MIC<0.12 µg/mL) and are likely susceptible to meropenem. Susceptibility of 
the isolates was considered intermediate to erythromycin (MIC=1 µg/mL) and 
borderline susceptible to azithromycin (MIC=2 µg/mL); clarithromycin was 
considered susceptible (MIC=0.25 µg/mL). 
B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC range: 
<0.06 ug/mL--0.12 µg/mL) and amoxicillin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL); ceftriaxone (MIC=16) was 
considered intermediate. NCCLS has not defined either a 
B.  anthracis  or  staphylococcal  interpretive  breakpoint  for  ceftriaxone  results;  thus,
breakpoints for 
gram-negative organisms were used to interpret ceftriaxone results. These ceftriaxone
MICs 
and additional laboratory data at CDC indicate the presence in 
B.  anthracis  isolates  of  a  cephalosporinase,  an  enzyme  that  inhibits  the  antibacterial
activity of 
cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone. Additional studies were performed with some of the
B.  anthracis  isolates  to  identify  other  beta-lactamases,  the  general  class  of  enzymes
that 
inactivate  penicillins,  cephalosporins,  and  related  drugs.  These  preliminary  studies
indicate 
the presence of a class B cephalosporinase and suggest that a penicillinase also may 
be present. These enzymes often are present in naturally occurring 
B. anthracis isolates.
This information is current as of October 24, 2001, 9 p.m. eastern daylight 
time. Intensive surveillance activities and environmental and case investigations are 
in progress to identify and treat all U.S. Postal Service workers and others at 
potential risk for anthrax. Surveillance also is being conducted to monitor adverse 
events  associated  with  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  for  anthrax.  CDC  and  FBI  are
collaborating 
to accelerate all aspects of the investigation surrounding these events.

Editorial Note:
 Bioterrorism attacks using 
B. anthracis spores sent through the mail have resulted in 15 anthrax cases and three
deaths. The initial anthrax cases 
occurred  among  persons  with  known  or  suspected  contact  with  opened  letters
contaminated 
with B. anthracis spores. Later, investigations identified four confirmed cases and 
one suspected case among postal workers who had no known contact with 
contaminated opened letters. This suggests that sealed envelopes contaminated with 
B.  anthracis  passing  through  the  postal  system  may  be  the  source  of  exposure.  The
number 
of contaminated envelopes passing through the postal system is not known. In 
addition, automated sorting could damage envelopes and release spores into postal 
environments; other circumstances that could contribute to the contamination of postal
facility environments may be identified. 
Because these cases are the result of intentional exposures, FBI and other 
law enforcement authorities are investigating these events as criminal acts and 
are working to identify and eliminate the source of these exposures. Until that occurs, 
the possibility of further exposure to B. 
anthracis and subsequent clinical illness 
exists. Clinicians and laboratorians should be vigilant for symptoms or laboratory 
findings  that  indicate  B.  anthracis  infection,  particularly  among  mail  handlers.

Managing Threats
Letters containing B. anthracis spores have been sent to persons in NYC and 
DC. Prompt identification of a threat and institution of appropriate measures may 
prevent inhalational anthrax. To prevent exposure to 
B.  anthracis  and  subsequent  infection,  suspicious  letters  or  packages  should  be
recognized and appropriate protective 
steps taken. 
Characteristics of suspicious packages and letters include inappropriate or 
unusual labeling, strange return address or no return address, postmarks from a city or 
state different from the return address, excessive packaging material, and others. If 
a package appears suspicious, it should not be opened. The package should be 
handled as little as possible. The room should be vacated and secured promptly 
and appropriate security or law enforcement agencies promptly notified (Box 1).
Managing Exposures
Identification of a patient with anthrax or a confirmed exposure to 
B.  anthracis  should  prompt  an  epidemiologic  investigation.  The  highest  priority  is  to
identify 
at-risk persons and initiate appropriate interventions to protect them. The 
exposure circumstances are the most important factors that direct decisions about 
prophylaxis. Persons with an exposure or contact with an item or environment known, 
or suspected to be contaminated with B. 
anthracis---regardless  of  laboratory  tests  results---should  be  offered  antimicrobial
prophylaxis.  Exposure or contact, 
not laboratory test results, is the basis for initiating such treatment. Culture of nasal 
swabs is used to detect anthrax spores. Nasal swabs can occasionally document 
exposure, but cannot rule out exposure to B. 
anthracis. As an adjunct to epidemiologic evaluations, nasal swabs may provide clues to
help assess the 
exposure circumstances. In addition, rapid evaluation of contaminated powder, 
including particle size and characteristics, may prove useful in assessing the risk for 
inhalational anthrax.
CDC is working with U.S. Postal Service employees and managers on 
several strategies to address the risk for anthrax among workers involved in mail 
handling. These strategies include personal protective equipment for workers handling
mail 
and engineering controls in mail facilities. Clinicians and laboratorians should be 
vigilant for symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate possible anthrax 
infection,  particularly  among  workers  involved  in  mail  sorting  and  distribution.

Antimicrobial Treatment
A high index of clinical suspicion and rapid administration of effective 
antimicrobial  therapy  is  essential  for  prompt  diagnosis  and  effective  treatment  of
anthrax. 
Limited clinical experience is available and no controlled trials in humans have been 
performed  to  validate  current  treatment  recommendations  for  inhalational  anthrax.
Based 
on studies in nonhuman primates and other animal and 
in vitro data, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline should be used for initial intravenous therapy
until 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  results  are  known  (Table  1).  Because  of  the  mortality
associated 
with inhalational anthrax, two or more antimicrobial agents predicted to be effective 
are recommended; however, controlled studies to support a multiple drug approach 
are not available. Other agents with in vitro activity suggested for use in conjunction 
with 
ciprofloxacin or doxycycline include rifampin, vancomycin, 
imipenem, chloramphenicol, penicillin and ampicillin, clindamycin, and clarithromycin;
but 
other than for penicillin, limited or no data exist regarding the use of these agents in 
the treatment of inhalational B. anthracis infection. Cephalosorins and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for therapy. Regimens being used to
treat patients described in this report include ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and vancomycin; 
and ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and clindamycin. 
Penicillin is labelled for use to treat inhalational anthrax. However, preliminary 
data indicate the presence of constitutive and inducible beta-lactamases in the 
B. anthracis isolates from Florida, NYC, and DC. Thus, treatment of systemic 
B.  anthracis  infection  using  a  penicillin  alone  (i.e.,  penicillin  G  and  ampicillin)  is  not
recommended. The 
B. anthracis genome sequence shows that this organism encodes two 
beta-lactamases:  a  penicillinase  and  a  cephalosporinase.  Data  in  the  literature  also
show that some 
beta-lactamase negative B. anthracis strains for which the penicillin MICs are 0.06 
µg/mL increase to 64 µg/mL and become beta-lactamase positive when exposed 
to semisynthetic penicillins (4). The frequency of this induction event is 
unknown.  Although  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  is  more  active  than  amoxicillin  alone
against 
beta-lactamase, producing strains in vitro, the combination may not be clinically 
effective  for  inhalational  anthrax  where  large  numbers  of  organisms  are  likely  to  be
present. 
Toxin-mediated morbidity is a major complication of systemic 
anthrax. Corticosteroids have been suggested as adjunct therapy for inhalational 
anthrax associated with extensive edema, respiratory compromise, and meningitis 
(5).
For cutaneous anthrax, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline also are first-line 
therapy  (Table  2).  As  for  inhalational  disease,  intravenous  therapy  with  a  multidrug
regimen 
is recommended for cutaneous anthrax with signs of systemic involvement, 
for extensive edema, or for lesions on the head and neck (Table 2). In cutaneous 
anthrax, antimicrobial treatment may render lesions culture negative in 24 hours, 
although progression to eschar formation still occurs 
(5). Some experts recommend that corticosteroids be considered for extensive edema
or swelling of the head and 
neck region associated with cutaneous anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is typically treated
for 
7--10 days; however, in this bioterrorism attack, the risk for simultaneous 
aerosol exposure appears to be high. Although infection may produce an effective 
immune response, a potential for reactivation of latent infection may exist. Therefore, 
persons  with  cutaneous  anthrax  associated  with  this  attack  should  be  treated  for  60
days.
Prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax exposure has been addressed in a 
previous report (1) and indicates the use of either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as first 
line agents. High-dose penicillin (e.g., amoxicillin or penicillin VK) may be an option 
for antimicrobial prophylaxis when ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are contraindicated. 
The likelihood of beta-lactamase induction events that would increase the penicillin MIC
is lower when only small numbers of vegetative cells are present, such as 
during antimicrobial prophylaxis. 
All medications may have undesirable side effects and allergic reactions may 
result from any medication. Clinicians prescribing these medications should be aware 
of their side effects and consult an infectious disease specialist as needed. 
Patients 
should be urged to inform their health-care provider of any adverse event.
This is the first bioterrorism-related anthrax attack in the United States, and 
the public health ramifications of this attack continue to evolve. Additional updates 
and recommendations will be published in 
MMWR.

 Investigations in NYC have identified five (three confirmed and two 
suspected) cutaneous anthrax cases; three cases (one confirmed and two suspected)
have 
been identified since the last report (1). These five cases were associated with four 
media companies (A--D). The two previously reported cases were related to work sites A
and B, and the three additional cases were related to work sites C, D, and A, 
respectively. No cases among postal workers have been identified.
 On October 1, a 27-year-old woman who regularly handled mail at work site 
C sought medical care at a local hospital for two lesions on the left cheek, 
which developed surrounding erythema and edema and local adenopathy. A biopsy 
obtained on October 16 was positive by IHC staining for the cell wall antigen of 
B.  anthracis  and  serologic  testing  was  weakly  reactive.  No  suspicious  letter  was
identified from 
her work site.
 Two suspected cases of cutaneous anthrax also have been detected. The 
first suspected case, a 29-year-old woman with onset of illness on September 22, 
frequently handled mail at work site D. At her work site, an unopened letter 
postmarked September 18, which contained powder contaminated with 
B.  anthracis  was  found  on  October  19.  The  second  suspected  case,  a  23-year-old
woman with onset of illness 
on September 28, handled a suspicious letter postmarked September 18 from work site 
A. All three patients were treated with ciprofloxacin and have shown 
clinical improvement. A total of three persons were confirmed by nasal swabs to have 
been exposed to B. anthracis, presumably acquired during handling and processing 
of specimens during the investigation of the first confirmed case 
(1). 
 In work site A, potentially exposed persons were identified and 
prescribed antimicrobial prophylaxis. An environmental investigation of work site A 
was conducted subsequently; environmental samples taken from work site A were 
culture-positive for B. anthracis. Of 1,360 persons who were tested by nasal swabs from
work site A, all were confirmed negative. Nasal swabs were obtained from 1,202 
persons from work sites B, C, and D; 1,183 tested negative and 19 are pending final 
results. Environmental samples taken from work site A were positive. Testing of 
environmental specimens from work sites B, C, and D is ongoing. 
 Prophylaxis was recommended for potentially exposed persons at work site 
A. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was initiated for nine persons who had recent contact 
with the sealed letter containing B. 
anthracis in work site D. 
New Jersey
 To date, investigations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have identified four 
(two confirmed and two suspected) anthrax cases. Cutaneous disease has been 
diagnosed in three patients and one has illness suspected to be inhalational anthrax, 
but laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis are pending. All four of these 
patients worked at one of two postal facilities in New Jersey. Although no 
specific contaminated letter was identified, contaminated letters destined for both NYC
and 
DC passed through at least one of these postal facilities in New Jersey. 
On October 1, a 45-year-old female mail carrier sought medical care at a 
local hospital for a 4-day history of worsening skin lesions on her right forearm. A 
biopsy was obtained and arrived at CDC on October 17 and later that night was found 
positive by IHC. In addition, tissue was positive for 
B. anthracis by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), and serologic testing was reactive. The patient's condition improved 
on antimicrobial therapy. 
On October 16, a 35-year-old male mail processor, with a history of a 
chronic, bullous-like skin condition, was taken to a local hospital complaining of a 2-day 
history of a large pustular lesion on his neck. He returned 1 day later with 
increasing  ulceration  of  the  skin  lesion  associated  with  fatigue,  chills,  and  a  swollen
throat; 
he was afebile but had vesicles and bullae around the pustular lesion. Biopsy was 
positive by IHC, and serologic testing was reactive to 
B. anthracis. The patient's lesions responded to antimicrobial therapy. 
Two suspected cases also have been detected. The first case occurred in a 
39-year-old male machine mechanic who was taken to a local hospital on September 26
for two bullous, vesicular lesions with surrounding erythema, edema, and induration 
on the right forearm, which progressed to black eschars. The patient was treated 
for cellulitis with ceftriaxone followed by amoxicillin/clavulanate. The patient was 
reported to CDC on October 17 and serologic testing at CDC was reactive 
to B. anthracis. No biopsy was obtained. The patient's condition improved.
On October 14, the second suspected case occurred in a 56-year-old female 
postal worker who sought medical care for fever, diarrhea, and vomiting at a local 
hospital. On October 19, the patient was admitted to the hospital with chills, dry cough, 
and pleuritic chest pain. A chest radiograph showed a small right infiltrate and 
bilateral effusions, but no evidence of a widened mediastinum. The next day, her 
respiratory status and pleural effusions worsened. A chest computerized tomography 
(CT) showed an enlarged mediastinal and cervical lymph nodes without 
parenchymal disease. The pleural fluid was positive for 
B. anthracis by PCR. Bilateral pleural effusions have complicated the patient's hospital
course and she continues to 
require supplemental oxygen.
On October 20, the postal facility was closed; the New Jersey Department of 
Health and Senior Services recommended that postal workers at both postal facilities 
initiate antimicrobial prophylaxis pending further epidemiologic and 
environmental 
investigation. Both facilities have been closed pending results of further 
environmental  evaluation.  Environmental  sampling  is  being  conducted  at  both  postal
facilities. In 
one facility, 13 of 23 samples from high-risk areas were preliminarily culture-positive for
B. anthracis. Clean-up efforts are ongoing. Results of cultures from samples taken in 
the second facility and results from approximately 600 nasal swab cultures obtained 
from postal employees are pending. 
District of Columbia
To date, investigations in DC, Maryland, and Virginia have identified four 
confirmed anthrax cases. All patients had inhalational illness and all worked at a single 
postal facility in DC. 
On October 15, a staff member in the office of a U.S. Senator noted a small burst 
of dust released while opening a tightly sealed letter. The U.S. Capitol Police and 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were notified and the area was vacated and 
secured  immediately;  ventilation  systems  for  the  Senator's  offices  were  deactivated
within 
45 minutes of recognizing the threat. The letter and surrounding carpet were 
removed and sent for testing. On October 16, the letter tested positive for 
B.  anthracis  by  PCR,  and  an  epidemiologic  investigation  was  initiated  by  the  health
officials from the 
Office of Attending Physician, U.S. Capitol; DC Department of Health (DCDOH); 
Infectious Disease Service, National Naval Medical Center; and CDC.
Based on the initial investigation, the area of exposure was determined to 
consist of two floors in the southeast quadrant of the building where the U.S. Senator's 
office is located. Approximately 340 staff and visitors potentially were exposed. 
Beginning October 15, nasal swab testing was performed on these persons and 
approximately  5,000  additional  persons  who  referred  themselves  for  testing.
Twenty-eight 
persons  had  evidence  of  exposure  by  nasal  swab  testing;  13  were  in  the  immediate
office 
space where the letter was opened, nine were in adjacent areas, and six were 
first responders. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered to persons from the area 
of exposure and first-responders to the incident. Environmental specimens 
were collected at the affected building and other buildings in the U.S. Capitol complex. 
To date, environmental specimens are positive from the area of exposure as well as 
two mail rooms in the U.S. Capitol complex; one of the mail rooms did not process 
the contaminated letter. None of the mail room personnel and none of the postal 
workers at the post office serving the mail rooms had positive nasal swabs. These 
mail handlers were all offered prophylactic antibiotics. Initially, a single 
positive environmental sample for the post office serving these mail rooms was 
positive.  Subsequent  samples  from  this  post  office  and  the  mail  distribution  center
serving 
this post office were positive.
On October 19, enhanced regional surveillance activities (a collaborative 
effort between DCDOH, Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and 
the Virginia Department of Health) identified a case of pulmonary illness in a 
postal worker. The postal worker, a 56-year-old man, sought medical care at a 
Virginia  hospital  for  fever,  chills,  chest  heaviness,  malaise,  and  minimally  productive
cough 
of 3 days' duration. Initial evaluation in the emergency department (ED) revealed 
a widened mediastinum on a chest radiograph; a subsequent CT scan 
revealed  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy  and  small,  bilateral  pleural  effusions.  The
patient 
was hospitalized for suspected inhalational anthrax and was treated with broad 
spectrum
 antimicrobial
 agents,
 including
 ciprofloxacin.
 Blood
 cultures
 grew
gram-positive 
rods 
within 15 hours of collection, later confirmed to be 
B. anthracis at the Virginia State Health Laboratory and CDC on October 21. The patient
is clinically stable and 
remains hospitalized. 
On October 20, a second postal worker, also a 56-year-old man, who worked at 
the same distribution center, was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history 
of progressively worsening headache and night sweats. He had no fever, stiff neck, 
or other symptoms or signs consistent with meningitis. He had a mild sore throat 
and occasional dry cough. Because the patient was linked epidemiologically to the 
index case of inhalational anthrax, a chest radiograph and chest CT scan were 
performed that revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a right middle lobe 
infiltrate. Antimicrobial therapy was initiated. Blood cultures grew 
B. anthracis within 18 hours. The patient is clinically stable and remains hospitalized. 
On October 21, a third postal worker, a 55-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially sought medical care at a physician's office on October
18 for 
2 days of progressive fatigue, myalgias, and fever. The patient had a temperature of 
102 F (38.9 C) and normal white blood cell count and was sent home. The patient 
returned to the ED on October 21 with persistent symptoms, including chills, vague 
chest tightness, and temperature of 102 F (38.9 C). Chest radiograph revealed right 
middle and lower lobe alveolar infiltrates and right hilar and peritracheal soft tissue 
fullness. Evaluation revealed hypoxia, leukocytosis, and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial therapy was initiated, and the patient was mechanically ventilated. The 
patient's condition deteriorated, and he died on October 21. Blood cultures obtained 
on admission to the hospital grew gram-positive bacilli, which were confirmed later as 
B. anthracis at CDC. 
On October 22, a fourth postal worker, a 47-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially presented to the ED on October 21 with complaints of
5 
days of progressive fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and syncope. The patient 
was afebrile and had orthostatic hypotension. A chest radiograph was obtained 
and reported to be normal. The patient received intravenous fluids and was discharged.
He returned to the ED 26 hours later following another syncopal episode and 
persistent
 gastrointestinal
 complaints.
 The
 patient
 was
 afebrile,
 hypotensive,
diaphoretic, and 
in respiratory distress. A second chest radiograph and a chest CT revealed 
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions. Subsequent review of the
first 
chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined area of increased density in the right subhilar 
region. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial  therapy  was  initiated,  and  the  patient  was  mechanically  ventilated.
Peripheral 
blood smear demonstrated gram-positive bacilli; blood cultures grew gram-positive 
bacilli within 18 hours and were confirmed as B. 
anthracis at CDC. The patient died on October 22.
On October 20, CDC and DCDOH initiated an investigation of the postal 
facility where the four patients were employed. Although no specific exposure event 
was identified, the contaminated tightly sealed letter that was mailed to the Senator's 
office was processed at this facility on October 12 before entering the Capitol 
mail distribution system. The postal facility was closed on October 21, and 
antimicrobial prophylaxis was recommended to employees working in proximity to the
same 
mail sorting area of the first patient. In addition, visitors to nonpublic operations areas 
of 
this facility also were offered antimicrobial prophylaxis.
On October 22, because of concern about the potential for unrecognized 
aerosol exposures among postal workers, antimicrobial therapy was recommended for 
all workers and visitors to nonpublic areas in this postal facility. Subsequently, 
this recommendation has been extended to all postal workers in the DC area 
directly served by this postal facility pending results of ongoing epidemiologic 
and environmental investigation.
The first patient also worked at a second postal facility. On October 21, this 
facility also was closed. Antimicrobial prophylaxis also was recommended for workers at
this facility pending further epidemiologic and environmental testing. 
Susceptibility Testing of B. anthracis Isolates
Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined for 11 
B. anthracis isolates associated with intentional exposures in Florida, NYC, and DC. 
Susceptibility  breakpoints  for  interpreting  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)
results for 
B. anthracis have not been determined by the National Committee for Clinical 
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS); thus, breakpoints for staphylococci were used 
(3). All B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL), doxycycline 
(MIC<0.03 µg/mL), chloramphenicol (MIC=4 µg/mL), clindamycin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), tetracycline (MIC=0.06 µg/mL), rifampin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), and vancomycin (MIC=1--2 
µg/mL). Limited testing of imipenem suggests that these organisms are also susceptible
to 
this agent (MIC<0.12 µg/mL) and are likely susceptible to meropenem. Susceptibility of 
the isolates was considered intermediate to erythromycin (MIC=1 µg/mL) and 
borderline susceptible to azithromycin (MIC=2 µg/mL); clarithromycin was 
considered susceptible (MIC=0.25 µg/mL). 
B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC range: 
<0.06 ug/mL--0.12 µg/mL) and amoxicillin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL); ceftriaxone (MIC=16) was 
considered intermediate. NCCLS has not defined either a 
B.  anthracis  or  staphylococcal  interpretive  breakpoint  for  ceftriaxone  results;  thus,
breakpoints for 
gram-negative organisms were used to interpret ceftriaxone results. These ceftriaxone
MICs 
and additional laboratory data at CDC indicate the presence in 
B.  anthracis  isolates  of  a  cephalosporinase,  an  enzyme  that  inhibits  the  antibacterial
activity of 
cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone. Additional studies were performed with some of the
B.  anthracis  isolates  to  identify  other  beta-lactamases,  the  general  class  of  enzymes
that 
inactivate  penicillins,  cephalosporins,  and  related  drugs.  These  preliminary  studies
indicate 
the presence of a class B cephalosporinase and suggest that a penicillinase also may 
be present. These enzymes often are present in naturally occurring 
B. anthracis isolates.
This information is current as of October 24, 2001, 9 p.m. eastern daylight 
time. Intensive surveillance activities and environmental and case investigations are 
in progress to identify and treat all U.S. Postal Service workers and others at 
potential risk for anthrax. Surveillance also is being conducted to monitor adverse 
events  associated  with  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  for  anthrax.  CDC  and  FBI  are
collaborating 
to accelerate all aspects of the investigation surrounding these events.

Editorial Note:
 Bioterrorism attacks using 
B. anthracis spores sent through the mail have resulted in 15 anthrax cases and three
deaths. The initial anthrax cases 
occurred  among  persons  with  known  or  suspected  contact  with  opened  letters
contaminated 
with B. anthracis spores. Later, investigations identified four confirmed cases and 
one suspected case among postal workers who had no known contact with 
contaminated opened letters. This suggests that sealed envelopes contaminated with 
B.  anthracis  passing  through  the  postal  system  may  be  the  source  of  exposure.  The
number 
of contaminated envelopes passing through the postal system is not known. In 
addition, automated sorting could damage envelopes and release spores into postal 
environments; other circumstances that could contribute to the contamination of postal
facility environments may be identified. 
Because these cases are the result of intentional exposures, FBI and other 
law enforcement authorities are investigating these events as criminal acts and 
are working to identify and eliminate the source of these exposures. Until that occurs, 
the possibility of further exposure to B. 
anthracis and subsequent clinical illness 
exists. Clinicians and laboratorians should be vigilant for symptoms or laboratory 
findings  that  indicate  B.  anthracis  infection,  particularly  among  mail  handlers.

Managing Threats
Letters containing B. anthracis spores have been sent to persons in NYC and 
DC. Prompt identification of a threat and institution of appropriate measures may 
prevent inhalational anthrax. To prevent exposure to 
B.  anthracis  and  subsequent  infection,  suspicious  letters  or  packages  should  be
recognized and appropriate protective 
steps taken. 
Characteristics of suspicious packages and letters include inappropriate or 
unusual labeling, strange return address or no return address, postmarks from a city or 
state different from the return address, excessive packaging material, and others. If 
a package appears suspicious, it should not be opened. The package should be 
handled as little as possible. The room should be vacated and secured promptly 
and appropriate security or law enforcement agencies promptly notified (Box 1).
Managing Exposures
Identification of a patient with anthrax or a confirmed exposure to 
B.  anthracis  should  prompt  an  epidemiologic  investigation.  The  highest  priority  is  to
identify 
at-risk persons and initiate appropriate interventions to protect them. The 
exposure circumstances are the most important factors that direct decisions about 
prophylaxis. Persons with an exposure or contact with an item or environment known, 
or suspected to be contaminated with B. 
anthracis---regardless  of  laboratory  tests  results---should  be  offered  antimicrobial
prophylaxis.  Exposure or contact, 
not laboratory test results, is the basis for initiating such treatment. Culture of nasal 
swabs is used to detect anthrax spores. Nasal swabs can occasionally document 
exposure, but cannot rule out exposure to B. 
anthracis. As an adjunct to epidemiologic evaluations, nasal swabs may provide clues to
help assess the 
exposure circumstances. In addition, rapid evaluation of contaminated powder, 
including particle size and characteristics, may prove useful in assessing the risk for 
inhalational anthrax.
CDC is working with U.S. Postal Service employees and managers on 
several strategies to address the risk for anthrax among workers involved in mail 
handling. These strategies include personal protective equipment for workers handling
mail 
and engineering controls in mail facilities. Clinicians and laboratorians should be 
vigilant for symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate possible anthrax 
infection,  particularly  among  workers  involved  in  mail  sorting  and  distribution.

Antimicrobial Treatment
A high index of clinical suspicion and rapid administration of effective 
antimicrobial  therapy  is  essential  for  prompt  diagnosis  and  effective  treatment  of
anthrax. 
Limited clinical experience is available and no controlled trials in humans have been 
performed  to  validate  current  treatment  recommendations  for  inhalational  anthrax.
Based 
on studies in nonhuman primates and other animal and 
in vitro data, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline should be used for initial intravenous therapy
until 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  results  are  known  (Table  1).  Because  of  the  mortality
associated 
with inhalational anthrax, two or more antimicrobial agents predicted to be effective 
are recommended; however, controlled studies to support a multiple drug approach 
are not available. Other agents with in vitro activity suggested for use in conjunction 
with 
ciprofloxacin or doxycycline include rifampin, vancomycin, 
imipenem, chloramphenicol, penicillin and ampicillin, clindamycin, and clarithromycin;
but 
other than for penicillin, limited or no data exist regarding the use of these agents in 
the treatment of inhalational B. anthracis infection. Cephalosorins and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for therapy. Regimens being used to
treat patients described in this report include ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and vancomycin; 
and ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and clindamycin. 
Penicillin is labelled for use to treat inhalational anthrax. However, preliminary 
data indicate the presence of constitutive and inducible beta-lactamases in the 
B. anthracis isolates from Florida, NYC, and DC. Thus, treatment of systemic 
B.  anthracis  infection  using  a  penicillin  alone  (i.e.,  penicillin  G  and  ampicillin)  is  not
recommended. The 
B. anthracis genome sequence shows that this organism encodes two 
beta-lactamases:  a  penicillinase  and  a  cephalosporinase.  Data  in  the  literature  also
show that some 
beta-lactamase negative B. anthracis strains for which the penicillin MICs are 0.06 
µg/mL increase to 64 µg/mL and become beta-lactamase positive when exposed 
to semisynthetic penicillins (4). The frequency of this induction event is 
unknown.  Although  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  is  more  active  than  amoxicillin  alone
against 
beta-lactamase, producing strains in vitro, the combination may not be clinically 
effective  for  inhalational  anthrax  where  large  numbers  of  organisms  are  likely  to  be
present. 
Toxin-mediated morbidity is a major complication of systemic 
anthrax. Corticosteroids have been suggested as adjunct therapy for inhalational 
anthrax associated with extensive edema, respiratory compromise, and meningitis 
(5).
For cutaneous anthrax, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline also are first-line 
therapy  (Table  2).  As  for  inhalational  disease,  intravenous  therapy  with  a  multidrug
regimen 
is recommended for cutaneous anthrax with signs of systemic involvement, 
for extensive edema, or for lesions on the head and neck (Table 2). In cutaneous 
anthrax, antimicrobial treatment may render lesions culture negative in 24 hours, 
although progression to eschar formation still occurs 
(5). Some experts recommend that corticosteroids be considered for extensive edema
or swelling of the head and 
neck region associated with cutaneous anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is typically treated
for 
7--10 days; however, in this bioterrorism attack, the risk for simultaneous 
aerosol exposure appears to be high. Although infection may produce an effective 
immune response, a potential for reactivation of latent infection may exist. Therefore, 
persons  with  cutaneous  anthrax  associated  with  this  attack  should  be  treated  for  60
days.
Prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax exposure has been addressed in a 
previous report (1) and indicates the use of either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as first 
line agents. High-dose penicillin (e.g., amoxicillin or penicillin VK) may be an option 
for antimicrobial prophylaxis when ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are contraindicated. 
The likelihood of beta-lactamase induction events that would increase the penicillin MIC
is lower when only small numbers of vegetative cells are present, such as 
during antimicrobial prophylaxis. 
All medications may have undesirable side effects and allergic reactions may 
result from any medication. Clinicians prescribing these medications should be aware 
of their side effects and consult an infectious disease specialist as needed. 
Patients 
should be urged to inform their health-care provider of any adverse event.
This is the first bioterrorism-related anthrax attack in the United States, and 
the public health ramifications of this attack continue to evolve. Additional updates 
and recommendations will be published in 
MMWR.

Box 1. Handling of Suspicious Packages or Envelopes
Do not shake or empty the contents of a suspicious package or envelope.
  Do not carry the package or envelope, show it to others, or allow others
    to examine it.
  Put the package or envelope on a stable surface; do not sniff, touch,
    taste, or look closely at it or any contents that may have spilled.
  Alert others in the area about the suspicious package or envelope. Leave
    the area, close any doors, and take actions to prevent others from entering
    the area. If possible, shut off the ventilation system.
  Wash hands with soap and water to prevent spreading potentially infectious
    material to face or skin. Seek additional instructions for exposed or
    potentially exposed persons.
  If at work, notify a supervisor, a security officer, or a law enforcement
    official. If at home, contact the local law enforcement agency.
  If possible, create a list of persons who were in the room or area when
    this suspicious letter or package was recognized and a list of persons who
    also may have handled this package or letter. Give the list to both the
    local public health authorities and law enforcement officials.

  To date, investigations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have identified four 
(two confirmed and two suspected) anthrax cases. Cutaneous disease has been 
diagnosed in three patients and one has illness suspected to be inhalational anthrax, 
but laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis are pending. All four of these 
patients worked at one of two postal facilities in New Jersey. Although no 
specific contaminated letter was identified, contaminated letters destined for both NYC
and 
DC passed through at least one of these postal facilities in New Jersey. 
 On October 1, a 45-year-old female mail carrier sought medical care at a 
local hospital for a 4-day history of worsening skin lesions on her right forearm. A 
biopsy was obtained and arrived at CDC on October 17 and later that night was found 
positive by IHC. In addition, tissue was positive for 
B. anthracis by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR), and serologic testing was reactive. The patient's condition improved 
on antimicrobial therapy. 
 On October 16, a 35-year-old male mail processor, with a history of a 
chronic, bullous-like skin condition, was taken to a local hospital complaining of a 2-day 
history of a large pustular lesion on his neck. He returned 1 day later with 
increasing  ulceration  of  the  skin  lesion  associated  with  fatigue,  chills,  and  a  swollen
throat; 
he was afebile but had vesicles and bullae around the pustular lesion. Biopsy was 
positive by IHC, and serologic testing was reactive to 
B. anthracis. The patient's lesions responded to antimicrobial therapy. 
 Two suspected cases also have been detected. The first case occurred in a 
39-year-old male machine mechanic who was taken to a local hospital on September 26
for two bullous, vesicular lesions with surrounding erythema, edema, and induration 
on the right forearm, which progressed to black eschars. The patient was treated 
for cellulitis with ceftriaxone followed by amoxicillin/clavulanate. The patient was 
reported to CDC on October 17 and serologic testing at CDC was reactive 
to B. anthracis. No biopsy was obtained. The patient's condition improved.
 On October 14, the second suspected case occurred in a 56-year-old female 
postal worker who sought medical care for fever, diarrhea, and vomiting at a local 
hospital. On October 19, the patient was admitted to the hospital with chills, dry cough, 
and pleuritic chest pain. A chest radiograph showed a small right infiltrate and 
bilateral effusions, but no evidence of a widened mediastinum. The next day, her 
respiratory status and pleural effusions worsened. A chest computerized tomography 
(CT) showed an enlarged mediastinal and cervical lymph nodes without 
parenchymal disease. The pleural fluid was positive for 
B. anthracis by PCR. Bilateral pleural effusions have complicated the patient's hospital
course and she continues to 
require supplemental oxygen.
 On October 20, the postal facility was closed; the New Jersey Department of 
Health and Senior Services recommended that postal workers at both postal facilities 
initiate antimicrobial prophylaxis pending further epidemiologic and 
environmental 
investigation. Both facilities have been closed pending results of further 
environmental  evaluation.  Environmental  sampling  is  being  conducted  at  both  postal
facilities. In 
one facility, 13 of 23 samples from high-risk areas were preliminarily culture-positive for
B. anthracis. Clean-up efforts are ongoing. Results of cultures from samples taken in 
the second facility and results from approximately 600 nasal swab cultures obtained 
from postal employees are pending. 
District of Columbia
To date, investigations in DC, Maryland, and Virginia have identified four 
confirmed anthrax cases. All patients had inhalational illness and all worked at a single 
postal facility in DC. 
On October 15, a staff member in the office of a U.S. Senator noted a small burst 
of dust released while opening a tightly sealed letter. The U.S. Capitol Police and 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were notified and the area was vacated and 
secured  immediately;  ventilation  systems  for  the  Senator's  offices  were  deactivated
within 
45 minutes of recognizing the threat. The letter and surrounding carpet were 
removed and sent for testing. On October 16, the letter tested positive for 
B.  anthracis  by  PCR,  and  an  epidemiologic  investigation  was  initiated  by  the  health
officials from the 
Office of Attending Physician, U.S. Capitol; DC Department of Health (DCDOH); 
Infectious Disease Service, National Naval Medical Center; and CDC.
Based on the initial investigation, the area of exposure was determined to 
consist of two floors in the southeast quadrant of the building where the U.S. Senator's 
office is located. Approximately 340 staff and visitors potentially were exposed. 
Beginning October 15, nasal swab testing was performed on these persons and 
approximately  5,000  additional  persons  who  referred  themselves  for  testing.
Twenty-eight 
persons  had  evidence  of  exposure  by  nasal  swab  testing;  13  were  in  the  immediate
office 
space where the letter was opened, nine were in adjacent areas, and six were 
first responders. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered to persons from the area 
of exposure and first-responders to the incident. Environmental specimens 
were collected at the affected building and other buildings in the U.S. Capitol complex. 
To date, environmental specimens are positive from the area of exposure as well as 
two mail rooms in the U.S. Capitol complex; one of the mail rooms did not process 
the contaminated letter. None of the mail room personnel and none of the postal 
workers at the post office serving the mail rooms had positive nasal swabs. These 
mail handlers were all offered prophylactic antibiotics. Initially, a single 
positive environmental sample for the post office serving these mail rooms was 
positive.  Subsequent  samples  from  this  post  office  and  the  mail  distribution  center
serving 
this post office were positive.
On October 19, enhanced regional surveillance activities (a collaborative 
effort between DCDOH, Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and 
the Virginia Department of Health) identified a case of pulmonary illness in a 
postal worker. The postal worker, a 56-year-old man, sought medical care at a 
Virginia  hospital  for  fever,  chills,  chest  heaviness,  malaise,  and  minimally  productive
cough 
of 3 days' duration. Initial evaluation in the emergency department (ED) revealed 
a widened mediastinum on a chest radiograph; a subsequent CT scan 
revealed  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy  and  small,  bilateral  pleural  effusions.  The
patient 
was hospitalized for suspected inhalational anthrax and was treated with broad 
spectrum
 antimicrobial
 agents,
 including
 ciprofloxacin.
 Blood
 cultures
 grew
gram-positive 
rods 
within 15 hours of collection, later confirmed to be 
B. anthracis at the Virginia State Health Laboratory and CDC on October 21. The patient
is clinically stable and 
remains hospitalized. 
On October 20, a second postal worker, also a 56-year-old man, who worked at 
the same distribution center, was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history 
of progressively worsening headache and night sweats. He had no fever, stiff neck, 
or other symptoms or signs consistent with meningitis. He had a mild sore throat 
and occasional dry cough. Because the patient was linked epidemiologically to the 
index case of inhalational anthrax, a chest radiograph and chest CT scan were 
performed that revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a right middle lobe 
infiltrate. Antimicrobial therapy was initiated. Blood cultures grew 
B. anthracis within 18 hours. The patient is clinically stable and remains hospitalized. 
On October 21, a third postal worker, a 55-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially sought medical care at a physician's office on October
18 for 
2 days of progressive fatigue, myalgias, and fever. The patient had a temperature of 
102 F (38.9 C) and normal white blood cell count and was sent home. The patient 
returned to the ED on October 21 with persistent symptoms, including chills, vague 
chest tightness, and temperature of 102 F (38.9 C). Chest radiograph revealed right 
middle and lower lobe alveolar infiltrates and right hilar and peritracheal soft tissue 
fullness. Evaluation revealed hypoxia, leukocytosis, and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial therapy was initiated, and the patient was mechanically ventilated. The 
patient's condition deteriorated, and he died on October 21. Blood cultures obtained 
on admission to the hospital grew gram-positive bacilli, which were confirmed later as 
B. anthracis at CDC. 
On October 22, a fourth postal worker, a 47-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially presented to the ED on October 21 with complaints of
5 
days of progressive fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and syncope. The patient 
was afebrile and had orthostatic hypotension. A chest radiograph was obtained 
and reported to be normal. The patient received intravenous fluids and was discharged.
He returned to the ED 26 hours later following another syncopal episode and 
persistent
 gastrointestinal
 complaints.
 The
 patient
 was
 afebrile,
 hypotensive,
diaphoretic, and 
in respiratory distress. A second chest radiograph and a chest CT revealed 
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions. Subsequent review of the
first 
chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined area of increased density in the right subhilar 
region. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial  therapy  was  initiated,  and  the  patient  was  mechanically  ventilated.
Peripheral 
blood smear demonstrated gram-positive bacilli; blood cultures grew gram-positive 
bacilli within 18 hours and were confirmed as B. 
anthracis at CDC. The patient died on October 22.
On October 20, CDC and DCDOH initiated an investigation of the postal 
facility where the four patients were employed. Although no specific exposure event 
was identified, the contaminated tightly sealed letter that was mailed to the Senator's 
office was processed at this facility on October 12 before entering the Capitol 
mail distribution system. The postal facility was closed on October 21, and 
antimicrobial prophylaxis was recommended to employees working in proximity to the
same 
mail sorting area of the first patient. In addition, visitors to nonpublic operations areas 
of 
this facility also were offered antimicrobial prophylaxis.
On October 22, because of concern about the potential for unrecognized 
aerosol exposures among postal workers, antimicrobial therapy was recommended for 
all workers and visitors to nonpublic areas in this postal facility. Subsequently, 
this recommendation has been extended to all postal workers in the DC area 
directly served by this postal facility pending results of ongoing epidemiologic 
and environmental investigation.
The first patient also worked at a second postal facility. On October 21, this 
facility also was closed. Antimicrobial prophylaxis also was recommended for workers at
this facility pending further epidemiologic and environmental testing. 
Susceptibility Testing of B. anthracis Isolates
Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined for 11 
B. anthracis isolates associated with intentional exposures in Florida, NYC, and DC. 
Susceptibility  breakpoints  for  interpreting  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)
results for 
B. anthracis have not been determined by the National Committee for Clinical 
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS); thus, breakpoints for staphylococci were used 
(3). All B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL), doxycycline 
(MIC<0.03 µg/mL), chloramphenicol (MIC=4 µg/mL), clindamycin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), tetracycline (MIC=0.06 µg/mL), rifampin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), and vancomycin (MIC=1--2 
µg/mL). Limited testing of imipenem suggests that these organisms are also susceptible
to 
this agent (MIC<0.12 µg/mL) and are likely susceptible to meropenem. Susceptibility of 
the isolates was considered intermediate to erythromycin (MIC=1 µg/mL) and 
borderline susceptible to azithromycin (MIC=2 µg/mL); clarithromycin was 
considered susceptible (MIC=0.25 µg/mL). 
B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC range: 
<0.06 ug/mL--0.12 µg/mL) and amoxicillin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL); ceftriaxone (MIC=16) was 
considered intermediate. NCCLS has not defined either a 
B.  anthracis  or  staphylococcal  interpretive  breakpoint  for  ceftriaxone  results;  thus,
breakpoints for 
gram-negative organisms were used to interpret ceftriaxone results. These ceftriaxone
MICs 
and additional laboratory data at CDC indicate the presence in 
B.  anthracis  isolates  of  a  cephalosporinase,  an  enzyme  that  inhibits  the  antibacterial
activity of 
cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone. Additional studies were performed with some of the
B.  anthracis  isolates  to  identify  other  beta-lactamases,  the  general  class  of  enzymes
that 
inactivate  penicillins,  cephalosporins,  and  related  drugs.  These  preliminary  studies
indicate 
the presence of a class B cephalosporinase and suggest that a penicillinase also may 
be present. These enzymes often are present in naturally occurring 
B. anthracis isolates.
This information is current as of October 24, 2001, 9 p.m. eastern daylight 
time. Intensive surveillance activities and environmental and case investigations are 
in progress to identify and treat all U.S. Postal Service workers and others at 
potential risk for anthrax. Surveillance also is being conducted to monitor adverse 
events  associated  with  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  for  anthrax.  CDC  and  FBI  are
collaborating 
to accelerate all aspects of the investigation surrounding these events.

Editorial Note:
 Bioterrorism attacks using 
B. anthracis spores sent through the mail have resulted in 15 anthrax cases and three
deaths. The initial anthrax cases 
occurred  among  persons  with  known  or  suspected  contact  with  opened  letters
contaminated 
with B. anthracis spores. Later, investigations identified four confirmed cases and 
one suspected case among postal workers who had no known contact with 
contaminated opened letters. This suggests that sealed envelopes contaminated with 
B.  anthracis  passing  through  the  postal  system  may  be  the  source  of  exposure.  The
number 
of contaminated envelopes passing through the postal system is not known. In 
addition, automated sorting could damage envelopes and release spores into postal 
environments; other circumstances that could contribute to the contamination of postal
facility environments may be identified. 
Because these cases are the result of intentional exposures, FBI and other 
law enforcement authorities are investigating these events as criminal acts and 
are working to identify and eliminate the source of these exposures. Until that occurs, 
the possibility of further exposure to B. 
anthracis and subsequent clinical illness 
exists. Clinicians and laboratorians should be vigilant for symptoms or laboratory 
findings  that  indicate  B.  anthracis  infection,  particularly  among  mail  handlers.

Managing Threats
Letters containing B. anthracis spores have been sent to persons in NYC and 
DC. Prompt identification of a threat and institution of appropriate measures may 
prevent inhalational anthrax. To prevent exposure to 
B.  anthracis  and  subsequent  infection,  suspicious  letters  or  packages  should  be
recognized and appropriate protective 
steps taken. 
Characteristics of suspicious packages and letters include inappropriate or 
unusual labeling, strange return address or no return address, postmarks from a city or 
state different from the return address, excessive packaging material, and others. If 
a package appears suspicious, it should not be opened. The package should be 
handled as little as possible. The room should be vacated and secured promptly 
and appropriate security or law enforcement agencies promptly notified (Box 1).
Managing Exposures
Identification of a patient with anthrax or a confirmed exposure to 
B.  anthracis  should  prompt  an  epidemiologic  investigation.  The  highest  priority  is  to
identify 
at-risk persons and initiate appropriate interventions to protect them. The 
exposure circumstances are the most important factors that direct decisions about 
prophylaxis. Persons with an exposure or contact with an item or environment known, 
or suspected to be contaminated with B. 
anthracis---regardless  of  laboratory  tests  results---should  be  offered  antimicrobial
prophylaxis.  Exposure or contact, 
not laboratory test results, is the basis for initiating such treatment. Culture of nasal 
swabs is used to detect anthrax spores. Nasal swabs can occasionally document 
exposure, but cannot rule out exposure to B. 
anthracis. As an adjunct to epidemiologic evaluations, nasal swabs may provide clues to
help assess the 
exposure circumstances. In addition, rapid evaluation of contaminated powder, 
including particle size and characteristics, may prove useful in assessing the risk for 
inhalational anthrax.
CDC is working with U.S. Postal Service employees and managers on 
several strategies to address the risk for anthrax among workers involved in mail 
handling. These strategies include personal protective equipment for workers handling
mail 
and engineering controls in mail facilities. Clinicians and laboratorians should be 
vigilant for symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate possible anthrax 
infection,  particularly  among  workers  involved  in  mail  sorting  and  distribution.
Information 
to guide health-care providers and laboratories is available at 
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov> (1).
Antimicrobial Treatment
A high index of clinical suspicion and rapid administration of effective 
antimicrobial  therapy  is  essential  for  prompt  diagnosis  and  effective  treatment  of
anthrax. 
Limited clinical experience is available and no controlled trials in humans have been 
performed  to  validate  current  treatment  recommendations  for  inhalational  anthrax.
Based 
on studies in nonhuman primates and other animal and 
in vitro data, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline should be used for initial intravenous therapy
until 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  results  are  known  (Table  1).  Because  of  the  mortality
associated 
with inhalational anthrax, two or more antimicrobial agents predicted to be effective 
are recommended; however, controlled studies to support a multiple drug approach 
are not available. Other agents with in vitro activity suggested for use in conjunction 
with 
ciprofloxacin or doxycycline include rifampin, vancomycin, 
imipenem, chloramphenicol, penicillin and ampicillin, clindamycin, and clarithromycin;
but 
other than for penicillin, limited or no data exist regarding the use of these agents in 
the treatment of inhalational B. anthracis infection. Cephalosorins and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for therapy. Regimens being used to
treat patients described in this report include ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and vancomycin; 
and ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and clindamycin. 
Penicillin is labelled for use to treat inhalational anthrax. However, preliminary 
data indicate the presence of constitutive and inducible beta-lactamases in the 
B. anthracis isolates from Florida, NYC, and DC. Thus, treatment of systemic 
B.  anthracis  infection  using  a  penicillin  alone  (i.e.,  penicillin  G  and  ampicillin)  is  not
recommended. The 
B. anthracis genome sequence shows that this organism encodes two 
beta-lactamases:  a  penicillinase  and  a  cephalosporinase.  Data  in  the  literature  also
show that some 
beta-lactamase negative B. anthracis strains for which the penicillin MICs are 0.06 
µg/mL increase to 64 µg/mL and become beta-lactamase positive when exposed 
to semisynthetic penicillins (4). The frequency of this induction event is 
unknown.  Although  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  is  more  active  than  amoxicillin  alone
against 
beta-lactamase, producing strains in vitro, the combination may not be clinically 
effective  for  inhalational  anthrax  where  large  numbers  of  organisms  are  likely  to  be
present. 
Toxin-mediated morbidity is a major complication of systemic 
anthrax. Corticosteroids have been suggested as adjunct therapy for inhalational 
anthrax associated with extensive edema, respiratory compromise, and meningitis 
(5).
For cutaneous anthrax, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline also are first-line 
therapy  (Table  2).  As  for  inhalational  disease,  intravenous  therapy  with  a  multidrug
regimen 
is recommended for cutaneous anthrax with signs of systemic involvement, 
for extensive edema, or for lesions on the head and neck (Table 2). In cutaneous 
anthrax, antimicrobial treatment may render lesions culture negative in 24 hours, 
although progression to eschar formation still occurs 
(5). Some experts recommend that corticosteroids be considered for extensive edema
or swelling of the head and 
neck region associated with cutaneous anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is typically treated
for 
7--10 days; however, in this bioterrorism attack, the risk for simultaneous 
aerosol exposure appears to be high. Although infection may produce an effective 
immune response, a potential for reactivation of latent infection may exist. Therefore, 
persons  with  cutaneous  anthrax  associated  with  this  attack  should  be  treated  for  60
days.
Prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax exposure has been addressed in a 
previous report (1) and indicates the use of either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as first 
line agents. High-dose penicillin (e.g., amoxicillin or penicillin VK) may be an option 
for antimicrobial prophylaxis when ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are contraindicated. 
The likelihood of beta-lactamase induction events that would increase the penicillin MIC
is lower when only small numbers of vegetative cells are present, such as 
during antimicrobial prophylaxis. 
All medications may have undesirable side effects and allergic reactions may 
result from any medication. Clinicians prescribing these medications should be aware 
of their side effects and consult an infectious disease specialist as needed. 
Patients 
should be urged to inform their health-care provider of any adverse event.
This is the first bioterrorism-related anthrax attack in the United States, and 
the public health ramifications of this attack continue to evolve. Additional updates 
and recommendations will be published in 
MMWR.

B.  anthracis  by  PCR,  and  an  epidemiologic  investigation  was  initiated  by  the  health
officials from the

space where the letter was opened, nine were in adjacent areas, and six were 
first responders. Antimicrobial prophylaxis was administered to persons from the area 
of exposure and first-responders to the incident. Environmental specimens 
were collected at the affected building and other buildings in the U.S. Capitol complex. 
To date, environmental specimens are positive from the area of exposure as well as 
two mail rooms in the U.S. Capitol complex; one of the mail rooms did not process 
the contaminated letter. None of the mail room personnel and none of the postal 
workers at the post office serving the mail rooms had positive nasal swabs. These 
mail handlers were all offered prophylactic antibiotics. Initially, a single 
positive environmental sample for the post office serving these mail rooms was 
positive.  Subsequent  samples  from  this  post  office  and  the  mail  distribution  center
serving 
this post office were positive.
 On October 19, enhanced regional surveillance activities (a collaborative 
effort between DCDOH, Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and 
the Virginia Department of Health) identified a case of pulmonary illness in a 
postal worker. The postal worker, a 56-year-old man, sought medical care at a 
Virginia  hospital  for  fever,  chills,  chest  heaviness,  malaise,  and  minimally  productive
cough 
of 3 days' duration. Initial evaluation in the emergency department (ED) revealed 
a widened mediastinum on a chest radiograph; a subsequent CT scan 
revealed  mediastinal  lymphadenopathy  and  small,  bilateral  pleural  effusions.  The
patient 
was hospitalized for suspected inhalational anthrax and was treated with broad 
spectrum
 antimicrobial
 agents,
 including
 ciprofloxacin.
 Blood
 cultures
 grew
gram-positive 
rods 
within 15 hours of collection, later confirmed to be 
B. anthracis at the Virginia State Health Laboratory and CDC on October 21. The patient
is clinically stable and 
remains hospitalized. 
 On October 20, a second postal worker, also a 56-year-old man, who worked at 
the same distribution center, was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history 
of progressively worsening headache and night sweats. He had no fever, stiff neck, 
or other symptoms or signs consistent with meningitis. He had a mild sore throat 
and occasional dry cough. Because the patient was linked epidemiologically to the 
index case of inhalational anthrax, a chest radiograph and chest CT scan were 
performed that revealed mediastinal lymphadenopathy and a right middle lobe 
infiltrate. Antimicrobial therapy was initiated. Blood cultures grew 
B. anthracis within 18 hours. The patient is clinically stable and remains hospitalized. 
 On October 21, a third postal worker, a 55-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially sought medical care at a physician's office on October
18 for 
2 days of progressive fatigue, myalgias, and fever. The patient had a temperature of 
102 F (38.9 C) and normal white blood cell count and was sent home. The patient 
returned to the ED on October 21 with persistent symptoms, including chills, vague 
chest tightness, and temperature of 102 F (38.9 C). Chest radiograph revealed right 
middle and lower lobe alveolar infiltrates and right hilar and peritracheal soft tissue 
fullness. Evaluation revealed hypoxia, leukocytosis, and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial therapy was initiated, and the patient was mechanically ventilated. The 
patient's condition deteriorated, and he died on October 21. Blood cultures obtained 
on admission to the hospital grew gram-positive bacilli, which were confirmed later as 
B. anthracis at CDC. 
 On October 22, a fourth postal worker, a 47-year-old man, who worked at the 
same distribution center was admitted to the hospital with suspected inhalational 
anthrax. The patient had initially presented to the ED on October 21 with complaints of
5 
days of progressive fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, and syncope. The patient 
was afebrile and had orthostatic hypotension. A chest radiograph was obtained 
and reported to be normal. The patient received intravenous fluids and was discharged.
He returned to the ED 26 hours later following another syncopal episode and 
persistent
 gastrointestinal
 complaints.
 The
 patient
 was
 afebrile,
 hypotensive,
diaphoretic, and 
in respiratory distress. A second chest radiograph and a chest CT revealed 
mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions. Subsequent review of the
first 
chest radiograph revealed an ill-defined area of increased density in the right subhilar 
region. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis and hemoconcentration. 
Antimicrobial  therapy  was  initiated,  and  the  patient  was  mechanically  ventilated.
Peripheral 
blood smear demonstrated gram-positive bacilli; blood cultures grew gram-positive 
bacilli within 18 hours and were confirmed as B. 
anthracis at CDC. The patient died on October 22.
 On October 20, CDC and DCDOH initiated an investigation of the postal 
facility where the four patients were employed. Although no specific exposure event 
was identified, the contaminated tightly sealed letter that was mailed to the Senator's 
office was processed at this facility on October 12 before entering the Capitol 
mail distribution system. The postal facility was closed on October 21, and 
antimicrobial prophylaxis was recommended to employees working in proximity to the
same 
mail sorting area of the first patient. In addition, visitors to nonpublic operations areas 
of 
this facility also were offered antimicrobial prophylaxis.
 On October 22, because of concern about the potential for unrecognized 
aerosol exposures among postal workers, antimicrobial therapy was recommended for 
all workers and visitors to nonpublic areas in this postal facility. Subsequently, 
this recommendation has been extended to all postal workers in the DC area 
directly served by this postal facility pending results of ongoing epidemiologic 
and environmental investigation.
 The first patient also worked at a second postal facility. On October 21, this 
facility also was closed. Antimicrobial prophylaxis also was recommended for workers at
this facility pending further epidemiologic and environmental testing. 
Susceptibility Testing of B. anthracis Isolates
Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined for 11 
B. anthracis isolates associated with intentional exposures in Florida, NYC, and DC. 
Susceptibility  breakpoints  for  interpreting  minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC)
results for 
B. anthracis have not been determined by the National Committee for Clinical 
Laboratory Standards (NCCLS); thus, breakpoints for staphylococci were used 
(3). All B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL), doxycycline 
(MIC<0.03 µg/mL), chloramphenicol (MIC=4 µg/mL), clindamycin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), tetracycline (MIC=0.06 µg/mL), rifampin 
(MIC<0.5 µg/mL), and vancomycin (MIC=1--2 
µg/mL). Limited testing of imipenem suggests that these organisms are also susceptible
to 
this agent (MIC<0.12 µg/mL) and are likely susceptible to meropenem. Susceptibility of 
the isolates was considered intermediate to erythromycin (MIC=1 µg/mL) and 
borderline susceptible to azithromycin (MIC=2 µg/mL); clarithromycin was 
considered susceptible (MIC=0.25 µg/mL). 
B. anthracis isolates were susceptible to penicillin (MIC range: 
<0.06 ug/mL--0.12 µg/mL) and amoxicillin 
(MIC<0.06 µg/mL); ceftriaxone (MIC=16) was 
considered intermediate. NCCLS has not defined either a 
B.  anthracis  or  staphylococcal  interpretive  breakpoint  for  ceftriaxone  results;  thus,
breakpoints for 
gram-negative organisms were used to interpret ceftriaxone results. These ceftriaxone
MICs 
and additional laboratory data at CDC indicate the presence in 
B.  anthracis  isolates  of  a  cephalosporinase,  an  enzyme  that  inhibits  the  antibacterial
activity of 
cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone. Additional studies were performed with some of the
B.  anthracis  isolates  to  identify  other  beta-lactamases,  the  general  class  of  enzymes
that 
inactivate  penicillins,  cephalosporins,  and  related  drugs.  These  preliminary  studies
indicate 
the presence of a class B cephalosporinase and suggest that a penicillinase also may 
be present. These enzymes often are present in naturally occurring 
B. anthracis isolates.
This information is current as of October 24, 2001, 9 p.m. eastern daylight 
time. Intensive surveillance activities and environmental and case investigations are 
in progress to identify and treat all U.S. Postal Service workers and others at 
potential risk for anthrax. Surveillance also is being conducted to monitor adverse 
events  associated  with  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  for  anthrax.  CDC  and  FBI  are
collaborating 
to accelerate all aspects of the investigation surrounding these events.

Editorial Note:
 Bioterrorism attacks using 
B. anthracis spores sent through the mail have resulted in 15 anthrax cases and three
deaths. The initial anthrax cases 
occurred  among  persons  with  known  or  suspected  contact  with  opened  letters
contaminated 
with B. anthracis spores. Later, investigations identified four confirmed cases and 
one suspected case among postal workers who had no known contact with 
contaminated opened letters. This suggests that sealed envelopes contaminated with 
B.  anthracis  passing  through  the  postal  system  may  be  the  source  of  exposure.  The
number 
of contaminated envelopes passing through the postal system is not known. In 
addition, automated sorting could damage envelopes and release spores into postal 
environments; other circumstances that could contribute to the contamination of postal
facility environments may be identified. 
Because these cases are the result of intentional exposures, FBI and other 
law enforcement authorities are investigating these events as criminal acts and 
are working to identify and eliminate the source of these exposures. Until that occurs, 
the possibility of further exposure to B. 
anthracis and subsequent clinical illness 
exists. Clinicians and laboratorians should be vigilant for symptoms or laboratory 
findings  that  indicate  B.  anthracis  infection,  particularly  among  mail  handlers.

Managing Threats
Letters containing B. anthracis spores have been sent to persons in NYC and 
DC. Prompt identification of a threat and institution of appropriate measures may 
prevent inhalational anthrax. To prevent exposure to 
B.  anthracis  and  subsequent  infection,  suspicious  letters  or  packages  should  be
recognized and appropriate protective 
steps taken. 
Characteristics of suspicious packages and letters include inappropriate or 
unusual labeling, strange return address or no return address, postmarks from a city or 
state different from the return address, excessive packaging material, and others. If 
a package appears suspicious, it should not be opened. The package should be 
handled as little as possible. The room should be vacated and secured promptly 
and appropriate security or law enforcement agencies promptly notified (Box 1).
Managing Exposures
Identification of a patient with anthrax or a confirmed exposure to 
B.  anthracis  should  prompt  an  epidemiologic  investigation.  The  highest  priority  is  to
identify 
at-risk persons and initiate appropriate interventions to protect them. The 
exposure circumstances are the most important factors that direct decisions about 
prophylaxis. Persons with an exposure or contact with an item or environment known, 
or suspected to be contaminated with B. 
anthracis---regardless  of  laboratory  tests  results---should  be  offered  antimicrobial
prophylaxis.  Exposure or contact, 
not laboratory test results, is the basis for initiating such treatment. Culture of nasal 
swabs is used to detect anthrax spores. Nasal swabs can occasionally document 
exposure, but cannot rule out exposure to B. 
anthracis. As an adjunct to epidemiologic evaluations, nasal swabs may provide clues to
help assess the 
exposure circumstances. In addition, rapid evaluation of contaminated powder, 
including particle size and characteristics, may prove useful in assessing the risk for 
inhalational anthrax.
CDC is working with U.S. Postal Service employees and managers on 
several strategies to address the risk for anthrax among workers involved in mail 
handling. These strategies include personal protective equipment for workers handling
mail 
and engineering controls in mail facilities. Clinicians and laboratorians should be 
vigilant for symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate possible anthrax 
infection,  particularly  among  workers  involved  in  mail  sorting  and  distribution.

Antimicrobial Treatment
A high index of clinical suspicion and rapid administration of effective 
antimicrobial  therapy  is  essential  for  prompt  diagnosis  and  effective  treatment  of
anthrax. 
Limited clinical experience is available and no controlled trials in humans have been 
performed  to  validate  current  treatment  recommendations  for  inhalational  anthrax.
Based 
on studies in nonhuman primates and other animal and 
in vitro data, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline should be used for initial intravenous therapy
until 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  results  are  known  (Table  1).  Because  of  the  mortality
associated 
with inhalational anthrax, two or more antimicrobial agents predicted to be effective 
are recommended; however, controlled studies to support a multiple drug approach 
are not available. Other agents with in vitro activity suggested for use in conjunction 
with 
ciprofloxacin or doxycycline include rifampin, vancomycin, 
imipenem, chloramphenicol, penicillin and ampicillin, clindamycin, and clarithromycin;
but 
other than for penicillin, limited or no data exist regarding the use of these agents in 
the treatment of inhalational B. anthracis infection. Cephalosorins and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for therapy. Regimens being used to
treat patients described in this report include ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and vancomycin; 
and ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and clindamycin. 
Penicillin is labelled for use to treat inhalational anthrax. However, preliminary 
data indicate the presence of constitutive and inducible beta-lactamases in the 
B. anthracis isolates from Florida, NYC, and DC. Thus, treatment of systemic 
B.  anthracis  infection  using  a  penicillin  alone  (i.e.,  penicillin  G  and  ampicillin)  is  not
recommended. The 
B. anthracis genome sequence shows that this organism encodes two 
beta-lactamases:  a  penicillinase  and  a  cephalosporinase.  Data  in  the  literature  also
show that some 
beta-lactamase negative B. anthracis strains for which the penicillin MICs are 0.06 
µg/mL increase to 64 µg/mL and become beta-lactamase positive when exposed 
to semisynthetic penicillins (4). The frequency of this induction event is 
unknown.  Although  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  is  more  active  than  amoxicillin  alone
against 
beta-lactamase, producing strains in vitro, the combination may not be clinically 
effective  for  inhalational  anthrax  where  large  numbers  of  organisms  are  likely  to  be
present. 
Toxin-mediated morbidity is a major complication of systemic 
anthrax. Corticosteroids have been suggested as adjunct therapy for inhalational 
anthrax associated with extensive edema, respiratory compromise, and meningitis 
(5).
For cutaneous anthrax, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline also are first-line 
therapy  (Table  2).  As  for  inhalational  disease,  intravenous  therapy  with  a  multidrug
regimen 
is recommended for cutaneous anthrax with signs of systemic involvement, 
for extensive edema, or for lesions on the head and neck (Table 2). In cutaneous 
anthrax, antimicrobial treatment may render lesions culture negative in 24 hours, 
although progression to eschar formation still occurs 
(5). Some experts recommend that corticosteroids be considered for extensive edema
or swelling of the head and 
neck region associated with cutaneous anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is typically treated
for 
7--10 days; however, in this bioterrorism attack, the risk for simultaneous 
aerosol exposure appears to be high. Although infection may produce an effective 
immune response, a potential for reactivation of latent infection may exist. Therefore, 
persons  with  cutaneous  anthrax  associated  with  this  attack  should  be  treated  for  60
days.
Prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax exposure has been addressed in a 
previous report (1) and indicates the use of either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as first 
line agents. High-dose penicillin (e.g., amoxicillin or penicillin VK) may be an option 
for antimicrobial prophylaxis when ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are contraindicated. 
The likelihood of beta-lactamase induction events that would increase the penicillin MIC
is lower when only small numbers of vegetative cells are present, such as 
during antimicrobial prophylaxis. 
All medications may have undesirable side effects and allergic reactions may 
result from any medication. Clinicians prescribing these medications should be aware 
of their side effects and consult an infectious disease specialist as needed. 
Patients 
should be urged to inform their health-care provider of any adverse event.
This is the first bioterrorism-related anthrax attack in the United States, and 
the public health ramifications of this attack continue to evolve. Additional updates 
and recommendations will be published in 
MMWR.

Box 1
Box 1. Handling of Suspicious Packages or Envelopes
Do not shake or empty the contents of a suspicious package or envelope.
  Do not carry the package or envelope, show it to others, or allow others
    to examine it.
  Put the package or envelope on a stable surface; do not sniff, touch,
    taste, or look closely at it or any contents that may have spilled.
  Alert others in the area about the suspicious package or envelope. Leave
    the area, close any doors, and take actions to prevent others from entering
    the area. If possible, shut off the ventilation system.
  Wash hands with soap and water to prevent spreading potentially infectious
    material to face or skin. Seek additional instructions for exposed or
    potentially exposed persons.
  If at work, notify a supervisor, a security officer, or a law enforcement
    official. If at home, contact the local law enforcement agency.
  If possible, create a list of persons who were in the room or area when
    this suspicious letter or package was recognized and a list of persons who
    also may have handled this package or letter. Give the list to both the
    local public health authorities and law enforcement officials.

Based 
on studies in nonhuman primates and other animal and 
in vitro data, ciprofloxacin or doxycycline should be used for initial intravenous therapy
until 
antimicrobial  susceptibility  results  are  known  (Table  1).  Because  of  the  mortality
associated 
with inhalational anthrax, two or more antimicrobial agents predicted to be effective 
are recommended; however, controlled studies to support a multiple drug approach 
are not available. Other agents with in vitro activity suggested for use in conjunction 
with 
ciprofloxacin or doxycycline include rifampin, vancomycin, 
imipenem, chloramphenicol, penicillin and ampicillin, clindamycin, and clarithromycin;
but 
other than for penicillin, limited or no data exist regarding the use of these agents in 
the treatment of inhalational B. anthracis infection. Cephalosorins and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for therapy. Regimens being used to
treat patients described in this report include ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and vancomycin; 
and ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and clindamycin. 
Penicillin is labelled for use to treat inhalational anthrax. However, preliminary 
data indicate the presence of constitutive and inducible beta-lactamases in the 
B. anthracis isolates from Florida, NYC, and DC. Thus, treatment of systemic 
B.  anthracis  infection  using  a  penicillin  alone  (i.e.,  penicillin  G  and  ampicillin)  is  not
recommended. The 
B. anthracis genome sequence shows that this organism encodes two 
beta-lactamases:  a  penicillinase  and  a  cephalosporinase.  Data  in  the  literature  also
show that some 
beta-lactamase negative B. anthracis strains for which the penicillin MICs are 0.06 
µg/mL increase to 64 µg/mL and become beta-lactamase positive when exposed 
to semisynthetic penicillins (4). The frequency of this induction event is 
unknown.  Although  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  is  more  active  than  amoxicillin  alone
against 
beta-lactamase, producing strains in vitro, the combination may not be clinically 
effective  for  inhalational  anthrax  where  large  numbers  of  organisms  are  likely  to  be
present. 
Toxin-mediated morbidity is a major complication of systemic 
anthrax. Corticosteroids have been suggested as adjunct therapy for inhalational 
anthrax associated with extensive edema, respiratory compromise, and meningitis 
(5).
For cutaneous anthrax, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline also are first-line 
therapy  (Table  2).  As  for  inhalational  disease,  intravenous  therapy  with  a  multidrug
regimen 
is recommended for cutaneous anthrax with signs of systemic involvement, 
for extensive edema, or for lesions on the head and neck (Table 2). In cutaneous 
anthrax, antimicrobial treatment may render lesions culture negative in 24 hours, 
although progression to eschar formation still occurs 
(5). Some experts recommend that corticosteroids be considered for extensive edema
or swelling of the head and 
neck region associated with cutaneous anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is typically treated
for 
7--10 days; however, in this bioterrorism attack, the risk for simultaneous 
aerosol exposure appears to be high. Although infection may produce an effective 
immune response, a potential for reactivation of latent infection may exist. Therefore, 
persons  with  cutaneous  anthrax  associated  with  this  attack  should  be  treated  for  60
days.
Prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax exposure has been addressed in a 
previous report (1) and indicates the use of either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as first 
line agents. High-dose penicillin (e.g., amoxicillin or penicillin VK) may be an option 
for antimicrobial prophylaxis when ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are contraindicated. 
The likelihood of beta-lactamase induction events that would increase the penicillin MIC
is lower when only small numbers of vegetative cells are present, such as 
during antimicrobial prophylaxis. 
All medications may have undesirable side effects and allergic reactions may 
result from any medication. Clinicians prescribing these medications should be aware 
of their side effects and consult an infectious disease specialist as needed. 
Patients 
should be urged to inform their health-care provider of any adverse event.
This is the first bioterrorism-related anthrax attack in the United States, and 
the public health ramifications of this attack continue to evolve. Additional updates 
and recommendations will be published in 
MMWR.

  Bioterrorism attacks using 
B. anthracis spores sent through the mail have resulted in 15 anthrax cases and three
deaths. The initial anthrax cases 
occurred  among  persons  with  known  or  suspected  contact  with  opened  letters
contaminated 
with B. anthracis spores. Later, investigations identified four confirmed cases and 
one suspected case among postal workers who had no known contact with 
contaminated opened letters. This suggests that sealed envelopes contaminated with 
B.  anthracis  passing  through  the  postal  system  may  be  the  source  of  exposure.  The
number 
of contaminated envelopes passing through the postal system is not known. In 
addition, automated sorting could damage envelopes and release spores into postal 
environments; other circumstances that could contribute to the contamination of postal
facility environments may be identified. 
 Because these cases are the result of intentional exposures, FBI and other 
law enforcement authorities are investigating these events as criminal acts and 
are working to identify and eliminate the source of these exposures. Until that occurs, 
the possibility of further exposure to B. 
anthracis and subsequent clinical illness 
exists. Clinicians and laboratorians should be vigilant for symptoms or laboratory 
findings  that  indicate  B.  anthracis  infection,  particularly  among  mail  handlers.

 Letters containing B. anthracis spores have been sent to persons in NYC and 
DC. Prompt identification of a threat and institution of appropriate measures may 
prevent inhalational anthrax. To prevent exposure to 
B.  anthracis  and  subsequent  infection,  suspicious  letters  or  packages  should  be
recognized and appropriate protective 
steps taken. 
 Characteristics of suspicious packages and letters include inappropriate or 
unusual labeling, strange return address or no return address, postmarks from a city or 
state different from the return address, excessive packaging material, and others. If 
a package appears suspicious, it should not be opened. The package should be 
handled as little as possible. The room should be vacated and secured promptly 
and appropriate security or law enforcement agencies promptly notified (Box 1).
Managing Exposures
Identification of a patient with anthrax or a confirmed exposure to 
B.  anthracis  should  prompt  an  epidemiologic  investigation.  The  highest  priority  is  to
identify 
at-risk persons and initiate appropriate interventions to protect them. The 
exposure circumstances are the most important factors that direct decisions about 
prophylaxis. Persons with an exposure or contact with an item or environment known, 
or suspected to be contaminated with B. 
anthracis---regardless  of  laboratory  tests  results---should  be  offered  antimicrobial
prophylaxis.  Exposure or contact, 
not laboratory test results, is the basis for initiating such treatment. Culture of nasal 
swabs is used to detect anthrax spores. Nasal swabs can occasionally document 
exposure, but cannot rule out exposure to B. 
anthracis. As an adjunct to epidemiologic evaluations, nasal swabs may provide clues to
help assess the 
exposure circumstances. In addition, rapid evaluation of contaminated powder, 
including particle size and characteristics, may prove useful in assessing the risk for 
inhalational anthrax.
CDC is working with U.S. Postal Service employees and managers on 
several strategies to address the risk for anthrax among workers involved in mail 
handling. These strategies include personal protective equipment for workers handling
mail 
and engineering controls in mail facilities. Clinicians and laboratorians should be 
vigilant for symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate possible anthrax 
infection,  particularly  among  workers  involved  in  mail  sorting  and  distribution.

Antimicrobial Treatment
A high index of clinical suspicion and rapid administration of effective 
antimicrobial  therapy  is  essential  for  prompt  diagnosis  and  effective  treatment  of
anthrax. 
Limited clinical experience is available and no controlled trials in humans have been 
performed  to  validate  current  treatment  recommendations  for  inhalational  anthrax.

ciprofloxacin or doxycycline include rifampin, vancomycin, 
imipenem, chloramphenicol, penicillin and ampicillin, clindamycin, and clarithromycin;
but 
other than for penicillin, limited or no data exist regarding the use of these agents in 
the treatment of inhalational B. anthracis infection. Cephalosorins and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should not be used for therapy. Regimens being used to
treat patients described in this report include ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and vancomycin; 
and ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and clindamycin. 
 Penicillin is labelled for use to treat inhalational anthrax. However, preliminary 
data indicate the presence of constitutive and inducible beta-lactamases in the 
B. anthracis isolates from Florida, NYC, and DC. Thus, treatment of systemic 
B.  anthracis  infection  using  a  penicillin  alone  (i.e.,  penicillin  G  and  ampicillin)  is  not
recommended. The 
B. anthracis genome sequence shows that this organism encodes two 
beta-lactamases:  a  penicillinase  and  a  cephalosporinase.  Data  in  the  literature  also
show that some 
beta-lactamase negative B. anthracis strains for which the penicillin MICs are 0.06 
µg/mL increase to 64 µg/mL and become beta-lactamase positive when exposed 
to semisynthetic penicillins (4). The frequency of this induction event is 
unknown.  Although  amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid  is  more  active  than  amoxicillin  alone
against 
beta-lactamase, producing strains in vitro, the combination may not be clinically 
effective  for  inhalational  anthrax  where  large  numbers  of  organisms  are  likely  to  be
present. 
 Toxin-mediated morbidity is a major complication of systemic 
anthrax. Corticosteroids have been suggested as adjunct therapy for inhalational 
anthrax associated with extensive edema, respiratory compromise, and meningitis 
(5).
 For cutaneous anthrax, ciprofloxacin and doxycycline also are first-line 
therapy  (Table  2).  As  for  inhalational  disease,  intravenous  therapy  with  a  multidrug
regimen 
is recommended for cutaneous anthrax with signs of systemic involvement, 
for extensive edema, or for lesions on the head and neck (Table 2). In cutaneous 
anthrax, antimicrobial treatment may render lesions culture negative in 24 hours, 
although progression to eschar formation still occurs 
(5). Some experts recommend that corticosteroids be considered for extensive edema
or swelling of the head and 
neck region associated with cutaneous anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax is typically treated
for 
7--10 days; however, in this bioterrorism attack, the risk for simultaneous 
aerosol exposure appears to be high. Although infection may produce an effective 
immune response, a potential for reactivation of latent infection may exist. Therefore, 
persons  with  cutaneous  anthrax  associated  with  this  attack  should  be  treated  for  60
days.
 Prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax exposure has been addressed in a 
previous report (1) and indicates the use of either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline as first 
line agents. High-dose penicillin (e.g., amoxicillin or penicillin VK) may be an option 
for antimicrobial prophylaxis when ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are contraindicated. 
The likelihood of beta-lactamase induction events that would increase the penicillin MIC
is lower when only small numbers of vegetative cells are present, such as 
during antimicrobial prophylaxis. 
 All medications may have undesirable side effects and allergic reactions may 
result from any medication. Clinicians prescribing these medications should be aware 
of their side effects and consult an infectious disease specialist as needed. 
Patients 
should be urged to inform their health-care provider of any adverse event.
 This is the first bioterrorism-related anthrax attack in the United States, and 
the public health ramifications of this attack continue to evolve. Additional updates 
and recommendations will be published in 
MMWR.

Box 1
Box 1. Handling of Suspicious Packages or Envelopes
Do not shake or empty the contents of a suspicious package or envelope.
  Do not carry the package or envelope, show it to others, or allow others
    to examine it.
  Put the package or envelope on a stable surface; do not sniff, touch,
    taste, or look closely at it or any contents that may have spilled.
  Alert others in the area about the suspicious package or envelope. Leave
    the area, close any doors, and take actions to prevent others from entering
    the area. If possible, shut off the ventilation system.
  Wash hands with soap and water to prevent spreading potentially infectious
    material to face or skin. Seek additional instructions for exposed or
    potentially exposed persons.
  If at work, notify a supervisor, a security officer, or a law enforcement
    official. If at home, contact the local law enforcement agency.
  If possible, create a list of persons who were in the room or area when
    this suspicious letter or package was recognized and a list of persons who
    also may have handled this package or letter. Give the list to both the
    local public health authorities and law enforcement officials.
