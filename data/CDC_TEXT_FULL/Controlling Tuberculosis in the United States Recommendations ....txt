Summary
During 1993--2003, incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in the United States decreased 44%
and is now occurring at 
a historic low level (14,874 cases in 2003). The Advisory Council for the Elimination of
Tuberculosis has called for 
a  renewed  commitment  to  eliminating  TB  in  the  United  States,  and  the  Institute  of
Medicine has published a detailed 
plan  for  achieving  that  goal.  In  this  statement,  the  American  Thoracic  Society  (ATS),
CDC, and the Infectious Diseases 
Society  of  America  (IDSA)  propose  recommendations  to  improve  the  control  and
prevention of TB in the United States and 
to progress toward its elimination.
This statement is one in a series issued periodically by the sponsoring organizations to
guide the diagnosis, 
treatment,  control,  and  prevention  of  TB.  This  statement  supersedes  the  previous
statement by ATS and CDC, which was 
also supported by IDSA and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). This statement
was drafted, after an 
evidence-based  review  of  the  subject,  by  a  panel  of  representatives  of  the  three
sponsoring organizations. AAP, the National 
Tuberculosis  Controllers  Association,  and  the  Canadian  Thoracic  Society  were  also
represented on the panel.
This  statement  integrates  recent  scientific  advances  with  current  epidemiologic  data,
other recent guidelines from 
this series, and other sources into a coherent and practical approach to the control of
TB in the United States. Although 
drafted to apply to TB control activities in the United States, this statement might be of
use in other countries in which 
persons  with  TB  generally  have  access  to  medical  and  public  health  services  and
resources necessary to make a precise diagnosis 
of the disease; achieve curative medical treatment; and otherwise provide substantial
science-based protection of 
the population against TB.
This statement is aimed at all persons who advocate, plan, and work at controlling and

This statement is one in a series issued periodically by the sponsoring organizations to
guide the diagnosis, 
treatment, control, and prevention of TB 
(3--5). This statement supersedes one published in 1992 by ATS and CDC, which 
also was supported by IDSA and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 
(6).  This  statement  was  drafted,  after  an  evidence-based  review  of  the  subject,  by  a
panel of representatives of the three sponsoring organizations. AAP, 
the  National  Tuberculosis  Controllers  Association  (NTCA),  and  the  Canadian  Thoracic

 The
 recommendations
 contained
 in
 this
 statement
 (see
 Graded
Recommendations for the Control and 
Prevention of Tuberculosis) were rated for their strength by use of a letter grade and for
the quality of the evidence on which 
they were based by use of a Roman numeral (Table 1) 
(7). No rating was assigned to recommendations that are considered 
to be standard practice (i.e., medical or administrative practices conducted routinely by
qualified persons who 
are experienced in their fields).
This  statement  integrates  recent  scientific  advances  with  current  epidemiologic  data,
other recent guidelines from 
this series (3--5), and other sources 
(2,8--10) into a coherent and practical approach to the control of TB in the 
United  States.  Although  drafted  to  apply  to  TB  control  activities  in  the  United  States,
this statement might be of use in 
other countries in which persons with TB generally have access to medical and public
health services and resources necessary 
to  make  a  precise  diagnosis  of  the  disease;  achieve  curative  medical  treatment;  and

This statement is aimed at all persons who advocate, plan, and work at controlling and
preventing TB in the 
United States, including persons who formulate public health policy and make decisions
about allocation of resources for 
disease  control  and  health  maintenance  and  directors  and  staff  members  of  state,

includes the full range of 
medical  practitioners,  organizations,  and  institutions  involved  in  the  health  care  of
persons in the United States who are at 
risk for TB.
Throughout  this  document,  the  terms  latent  TB  infection  (LTBI),  TB,  TB  disease,  and
infectious TB disease are 
used. LTBI is used to designate a condition in which an individual is infected with 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis but does not currently have active disease. Such patients
are at risk for progressing to tuberculosis disease. Treatment of 
LTBI (previously called preventive therapy or chemoprophylaxis) is indicated for those
at increased risk for progression 
as described in the text. Persons with LTBI are asymptomatic and have a negative chest
radiograph. TB, TB disease, 
and infectious TB indicate that the disease caused by 
M. tuberculosis is clinically active; patients with TB are 
generally symptomatic for disease. Positive culture results for 
M. tuberculosis complex are an indication of TB disease. Infectious 
TB  refers  to  TB  disease  of  the  lungs  or  larynx;  persons  with  infectious  TB  have  the
potential to transmit 
M. tuberculosis to other persons.
Progress Toward TB Elimination
A strategic plan for the elimination of TB in the United States was published in 1989 
(11), when the United States was experiencing a resurgence of TB 
(Figure 1). The TB resurgence was attributable to the expansion of HIV 
infection, nosocomial transmission of 
M. tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant TB, and increasing immigration from counties with 
a high incidence of TB. Decision makers also realized that the U.S. infrastructure for TB
control had deteriorated 
(12); this problem was corrected by a substantial infusion of resources at the national,
state, and local levels 
(13).  As  a  result,  the  increasing  incidence  of  TB  was  arrested;  during  1993--2003,  an
uninterrupted 44% decline in incidence 
occurred,  and  in  2003,  TB  incidence  reached  a  historic  low  level.  This  success  in
responding to the first resurgence of TB 
in decades indicates that a coherent national strategy; coordination of local, state, and
federal action; and availability 
of adequate resources can result in dramatic declines in TB incidence. This success also
raised again the possible 
elimination of TB, and in 1999, ACET reaffirmed the goal of tuberculosis elimination in
the United States 
(1).
The prospect of eliminating tuberculosis was critically analyzed in an independent study
published by IOM in 
2000 (2). The IOM study concluded that TB could ultimately be eliminated but that at
the present rate of 
decline,  elimination  would  take  >70  years.  Calling  for  greater  levels  of  effort  and
resources than were then available, the 
IOM  report  proposed  a  comprehensive  plan  to  1)  adjust  control  measures  to  the
declining incidence of disease; 2) 
accelerate  the  decline  in  incidence  by  increasing  targeted  testing  and  treatment  of
LTBI; 3) develop new tools for 
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention; 4) increase U.S. involvement in global control of
TB; and 5) mobilize and sustain 
public support for TB elimination. The report also noted the cyclical nature of the U.S.
response to TB and warned 
against allowing another "cycle of neglect" to occur, similar to that which caused the
1985--1992 resurgence.
As noted, the 44% decrease in incidence of TB in the United States during 1993--2003 
(14,15) has been attributed to the development of effective interventions enabled by
increased resources at the national, state, and local 
levels  (1,2,16).  Whereas  institutional  resources  targeted  specific  problems  such  as
transmission of TB in health-care 
facilities, 
public resources were earmarked largely for public health agencies, which used them to
rebuild the 
TB-control infrastructure (13,17). A primary objective of these efforts was to increase
the rate of completion of therapy 
among  persons  with  TB,  which  was  achieved  by  innovative  case-management
strategies, including greater use of 
directly  observed  therapy  (DOT).  During  1993--2000,  the  percentage  of  persons  with
reported TB who received DOT alone 
or in combination with self-supervised treatment increased from 38% to 78%, and the
proportion of persons 
who completed therapy in <1 year after receiving a diagnosis increased from 63% to
80% 
(14).  Continued  progress  in  the  control  of  TB  in  the  United  States  will  require
consolidation of the gains made through improved cure rates 
and implementation of new strategies to further reduce incidence of TB.
Challenges to Progress Toward TB Elimination
The development of optimal strategies to guide continuing efforts in TB control depends
on understanding 
the challenges confronting the effort. The five most important challenges to successful
control of TB in the United States 
are 1) prevalence of TB among foreign-born persons residing in the United States; 2)
delays in detecting and reporting 
cases of pulmonary TB; 3) deficiencies in protecting contacts of persons with infectious
TB and in preventing and 
responding to TB outbreaks; 4) persistence of a substantial population of persons living
in the United States with LTBI who are 
at  risk  for  progression  to  TB  disease;  and  5)  maintaining  clinical  and  public  health
expertise in an era of declining 
TB  incidence.  These  five  concerns  (Box  1)  serve  as  the  focal  point  for  the
recommendations made in this statement 
to control and prevent TB in the United States.
Prevalence of TB Among Foreign-Born Persons Residing in the United States
Once  a  disease  that  predominately  affected  U.S.-born  persons,  TB  now  affects  a
comparable number of 
foreign-born  persons  who  reside  in  the  United  States  permanently  or  temporarily,
although such persons make up only 11% of 
the  U.S.  population  (14).  During  1993--2003,  as  TB  incidence  in  the  United  States
declined sharply, incidence 
among foreign-born persons changed little 
(14). Lack of access to medical services because of cultural, linguistic, financial, 
or legal barriers results in delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB among foreign-born
persons and in ongoing 
transmission of the disease (18--21). Successful control of TB in the United States and
progress toward its elimination depend on 
the  development  of  effective  strategies  to  control  and  prevent  the  disease  among
foreign-born 
persons.
Delays in Detection and Reporting of Cases of Pulmonary TB
New cases of infectious TB should be diagnosed and 
reported as early as possible in the course of the illness so 
curative  treatment  can  be  initiated,  transmission  interrupted,  and  public  health
responses (e.g., contact investigation and 
case-management services) promptly arranged. However, 
delays in case detection and reporting continue to occur; 
these delays are attributed to medical errors 
(22--26) and to patient factors (e.g., lack of understanding about TB, fear of 
the authorities, and lack of access to medical services) 
(18--20). In addition, genotyping studies have revealed evidence 
of persistent transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  in  communities  that  have  implemented  highly  successful  control
measures 
(27--29), suggesting that such transmission occurred before a diagnosis was received.
Improvements in the detection of 
TB cases, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment, would bring substantial benefits to
affected patients and their 
contacts, decrease TB among children, and prevent outbreaks.
Deficiencies in Protecting Contacts of Person with Infectious TB and in Preventing 
and Responding to TB Outbreaks
Although  following  up  contacts  is  among  the  highest  public  health  priorities  in
responding to a case of TB, 
problems in conducting contact investigations have been reported 
(30--32). Approaches to contact investigations vary widely 
from program to program, and traditional investigative methods are not well adapted to
certain populations at high risk. 
Only half of at-risk contacts complete a course of treatment for LTBI 
(32). Reducing the risk of TB among contacts 
through  the  development  of  better  methods  of  identification,  evaluation,  and
management would lead to substantial 
personal and public health benefits and facilitate progress toward eliminating TB in the
United States.
Delayed detection of TB cases and suboptimal contact 
investigation can lead to TB outbreaks, which are 
increasingly  reported  (26,33--38).  Persistent  social  problems  such  as  crowding  in
homeless shelters and detention facilities 
are 
contributing factors to the upsurge in TB outbreaks. The majority of jurisdictions lack
the expertise and 
resources needed to conduct surveillance for TB outbreaks and to respond effectively
when they occur. Outbreaks have become 
an important element in the epidemiology of TB, and measures to detect, manage, and
prevent them are needed.
Persistence of a Substantial Population of Persons Living in the United States with LTBI 
Who Are at Risk for Progression to TB Disease
An estimated 9.6--14.9 million persons residing in the United States have LTBI 
(39).  This  pool  of  persons  with  latent  infection  is  continually  supplemented  by
immigration from areas of the world with a high incidence of TB and 
by ongoing person-to-person transmission among certain populations at high risk. For
TB disease to be prevented 
among persons with LTBI, those at highest risk must be identified and receive curative
treatment 
(4).  Progress  toward  the  elimination  of  TB  in  the  United  States  requires  the
development of new cost-effective strategies for targeted testing 
and treatment of persons with LTBI (17,40).
Maintaining Clinical and Public Health Expertise in an Era of Declining TB Incidence
Detecting a TB case, curing a person with TB, and protecting contacts of such persons
requires that clinicians and 
the staff members of public health agencies responsible for TB have specific expertise.
However, as TB becomes less 
common,  maintaining  such  expertise  throughout  the  loosely  coordinated  TB-control
system is challenging. As noted 
previously, medical errors associated with the detection of TB cases are common, and
deficiencies exist in important public 
health responsibilities such as contact investigations and outbreak response. Errors in
the treatment and management of 
TB patients continue to occur (41,42). Innovative approaches to education of medical
practitioners, new models 
for organizing TB services (2), and a clear understanding and acceptance of roles and
responsibilities by an expanded 
group of participants in TB control will be needed to ensure that the clinical and public
health expertise 
necessary to progress toward the elimination of TB are 
maintained.
Meeting the Challenges to TB Elimination
Further  improvements  in  the  control  and  prevention  of  TB  in  the  United  States  will
require a continued strong 
public health infrastructure and involvement of a range of health professionals outside
the public health sector. The 
traditional  model  of  TB  control  in  the  United  States,  in  which  planning  and  execution
reside almost exclusively with the 
public  health  sector  (17),  is  no  longer  the  optimal  approach  during  a  sustained  drive
toward the elimination of TB. 
This  statement  emphasizes  that  success  in  controlling  TB  and  progressing  toward  its
elimination in the United States 
will  depend  on  the  integrated  activities  of  professionals  from  different  fields  in  the
health sciences. This statement 
proposes  specific  measures  to  enhance  TB  control  so  as  to  meet  the  most  important
challenges; affirms the essential role of 
the public health sector in planning, coordinating, and evaluating the effort 
(43); proposes roles and responsibilities for 
the  full  range  of  participants;  and  introduces  new  approaches  to  the  detection  of  TB
cases, contact investigations, 
and targeted testing and treatment of persons with LTBI.
The  plan  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  TB  in  the  United  States  must  be  viewed  in  the
larger context of the global effort 
to control TB. The global TB burden is substantial and increasing. In 2000, an estimated
8.3 million (7.9--9.2 
million)  new  cases  of  TB  occurred,  and  1.84  million  (1.59--2.22  million)  persons  died
from TB; during 1997--2000, 
the worldwide TB case rate increased 1.8%/year 
(44). TB is increasing worldwide as a result of inadequate local 
resources and the global epidemic of HIV infection. In sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of TB
cases is increasing 6.4%/year 
(44). ACET (1), IOM (2), and other public health authorities 
(45,46) have acknowledged that TB will not be eliminated 
in the United States until the global epidemic is brought under control, and they have
called for greater U.S. 
involvement  in  global  control  efforts.  In  response,  CDC  and  ATS  have  become  active
participants in a multinational 
partnership (Stop TB Partnership) that was formed to guide the global efforts against
TB. U.S. public and private entities also 
have provided assistance to countries with a high burden of TB and funding for research
to develop new, improved tools 
for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, including an effective vaccine.
Despite the global TB epidemic, substantial gains can be made toward elimination of TB
in the United States 
by focusing on improvements in existing clinical and public health practices 
(47--49).  However,  the  drive  toward  TB  elimination  in  the  United  States  will  be
resource-intensive 
(1,12). Public health agencies that plan and coordinate 
TB-
control efforts in states and communities need sufficient strength in terms of personnel,
facilities, and training 
to discharge their responsibilities successfully, and the growing number of 
nonpublic  health  contributors  to  TB  control,  all  pursuing  diverse  individual  and
institutional goals, 
should receive value for their contributions. Continued progress 
toward TB elimination in the United States will require strengthening the nation's public
health infrastructure rather 
than reducing it (1,50).
Basic Principles of TB Control in the United States
Four prioritized strategies exist to prevent and control TB in the United States 
(17), as follows:
The  first  strategy  is  to  promptly  detect  and  report  persons  who  have  contracted  TB.
Because the majority of 
persons with TB receive a diagnosis when they seek medical care for symptoms caused
by progression of the disease, 
health-care providers, particularly those providing primary health care to populations at
high risk, are key contributors 
to the detection of TB cases and to case reporting 
to the jurisdictional public health agency for surveillance 
purposes and for facilitating a treatment plan and case-management services.
The second strategy is to protect close contacts of 
patients with contagious TB from contracting TB infection 
and disease. Contact evaluation not only identifies persons in the early stages of LTBI,
when the risk for disease 
is greatest (30--32), but is also an important tool to detect further cases of TB disease.
The  third  strategy  is  to  take  concerted  action  to  prevent  TB  among  the  substantial
population of U.S. residents 
with LTBI. This is accomplished by identifying those at highest risk for progression from
latent infection to 
active TB through targeted testing and administration of a curative course of treatment 
(4).  Two  approaches  exist  for  increasing  targeted  testing  and  treatment  of  LTBI.  The
first approach is to encourage clinic-based testing of 
persons who are under a clinician's care for a medical 
condition, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or 
diabetes mellitus, who are at risk for progressing from LTBI to active TB 
(4). The second approach is to establish 
specific  programs  to  reach  persons  who  have  an  increased  prevalence  of  LTBI,  an
increased risk for developing active disease 
if LTBI is present, or both (51).
The fourth strategy is to reduce the rising burden of TB from recent transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  by  identifying  settings  at  high  risk  for  transmission  and  applying
effective infection-control measures to reduce the risk. This 
strategy was used during the 1985--1992 TB resurgence, when disease attributable to
recent transmission was an 
important component of the increase in TB incidence 
(52--54). TB morbidity attributable to recent spread of 
M. tuberculosis continues to be a prominent part of the epidemiology of the disease in
the United States. Data collected by 
CDC's  National  Tuberculosis  Genotyping  and  Surveillance  Network  at  seven  sentinel
surveillance sites indicate that 44% 
of  M.  tuberculosis  isolates  from  persons  with  newly  diagnosed  cases  of  TB  were
clustered with at least one other 
intrasite isolate, often representing TB disease associated with recent spread of 
M. tuberculosis (55). TB outbreaks are also 
being reported with greater frequency in correctional facilities 
(37), homeless shelters (33), bars 
(27),  and  newly  recognized  social  settings  (e.g.,  among  persons  in  an  East  Coast
network of gay, transvestite, and transsexual HIV-infected 
men [34]; persons frequenting an abandoned junkyard building used for illicit drug use
and prostitution 
[26]; and dancers in adult entertainment clubs and their contacts, including children 
[38]).
Institutional  infection-control  measures  developed  in  the  1990s  in  response  to  the
1985--1992 resurgence 
in transmission of M. tuberculosis in the United States 
(10) have been highly successful in health-care facilities 
(56). However, newly recognized high-risk environments 
(26,27,33,34,37,38) present challenges to the 
implementation of effective infection-control measures. Further 
attention is required to control the transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in these environments.

Progress Toward TB Elimination
 A strategic plan for the elimination of TB in the United States was published in 1989 
(11), when the United States was experiencing a resurgence of TB 
(Figure 1). The TB resurgence was attributable to the expansion of HIV 
infection, nosocomial transmission of 
M. tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant TB, and increasing immigration from counties with 
a high incidence of TB. Decision makers also realized that the U.S. infrastructure for TB
control had deteriorated 
(12); this problem was corrected by a substantial infusion of resources at the national,
state, and local levels 
(13).  As  a  result,  the  increasing  incidence  of  TB  was  arrested;  during  1993--2003,  an
uninterrupted 44% decline in incidence 
occurred,  and  in  2003,  TB  incidence  reached  a  historic  low  level.  This  success  in
responding to the first resurgence of TB 
in decades indicates that a coherent national strategy; coordination of local, state, and
federal action; and availability 
of adequate resources can result in dramatic declines in TB incidence. This success also
raised again the possible 
elimination of TB, and in 1999, ACET reaffirmed the goal of tuberculosis elimination in
the United States 
(1).
 The  prospect  of  eliminating  tuberculosis  was  critically  analyzed  in  an  independent
study published by IOM in 
2000 (2). The IOM study concluded that TB could ultimately be eliminated but that at
the present rate of 
decline,  elimination  would  take  >70  years.  Calling  for  greater  levels  of  effort  and
resources than were then available, the 
IOM  report  proposed  a  comprehensive  plan  to  1)  adjust  control  measures  to  the
declining incidence of disease; 2) 
accelerate  the  decline  in  incidence  by  increasing  targeted  testing  and  treatment  of
LTBI; 3) develop new tools for 
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention; 4) increase U.S. involvement in global control of
TB; and 5) mobilize and sustain 
public support for TB elimination. The report also noted the cyclical nature of the U.S.
response to TB and warned 
against allowing another "cycle of neglect" to occur, similar to that which caused the
1985--1992 resurgence.
 As noted, the 44% decrease in incidence of TB in the United States during 1993--2003 
(14,15) has been attributed to the development of effective interventions enabled by
increased resources at the national, state, and local 
levels  (1,2,16).  Whereas  institutional  resources  targeted  specific  problems  such  as
transmission of TB in health-care 
facilities, 
public resources were earmarked largely for public health agencies, which used them to
rebuild the 
TB-control infrastructure (13,17). A primary objective of these efforts was to increase
the rate of completion of therapy 
among  persons  with  TB,  which  was  achieved  by  innovative  case-management
strategies, including greater use of 
directly  observed  therapy  (DOT).  During  1993--2000,  the  percentage  of  persons  with
reported TB who received DOT alone 
or in combination with self-supervised treatment increased from 38% to 78%, and the
proportion of persons 
who completed therapy in <1 year after receiving a diagnosis increased from 63% to
80% 
(14).  Continued  progress  in  the  control  of  TB  in  the  United  States  will  require
consolidation of the gains made through improved cure rates 
and implementation of new strategies to further reduce incidence of TB.
Challenges to Progress Toward TB Elimination
 The  development  of  optimal  strategies  to  guide  continuing  efforts  in  TB  control
depends on understanding 
the challenges confronting the effort. The five most important challenges to successful
control of TB in the United States 
are 1) prevalence of TB among foreign-born persons residing in the United States; 2)
delays in detecting and reporting 
cases of pulmonary TB; 3) deficiencies in protecting contacts of persons with infectious
TB and in preventing and 
responding to TB outbreaks; 4) persistence of a substantial population of persons living
in the United States with LTBI who are 
at  risk  for  progression  to  TB  disease;  and  5)  maintaining  clinical  and  public  health
expertise in an era of declining 
TB  incidence.  These  five  concerns  (Box  1)  serve  as  the  focal  point  for  the
recommendations made in this statement 
to control and prevent TB in the United States.
 
Prevalence of TB Among Foreign-Born Persons Residing in the United States
 Once  a  disease  that  predominately  affected  U.S.-born  persons,  TB  now  affects  a
comparable number of 
foreign-born  persons  who  reside  in  the  United  States  permanently  or  temporarily,
although such persons make up only 11% of 
the  U.S.  population  (14).  During  1993--2003,  as  TB  incidence  in  the  United  States
declined sharply, incidence 
among foreign-born persons changed little 
(14). Lack of access to medical services because of cultural, linguistic, financial, 
or legal barriers results in delays in diagnosis and treatment of TB among foreign-born
persons and in ongoing 
transmission of the disease (18--21). Successful control of TB in the United States and
progress toward its elimination depend on 
the  development  of  effective  strategies  to  control  and  prevent  the  disease  among
foreign-born 
persons.
 
Delays in Detection and Reporting of Cases of Pulmonary TB
 New cases of infectious TB should be diagnosed and 
reported as early as possible in the course of the illness so 
curative  treatment  can  be  initiated,  transmission  interrupted,  and  public  health
responses (e.g., contact investigation and 
case-management services) promptly arranged. However, 
delays in case detection and reporting continue to occur; 
these delays are attributed to medical errors 
(22--26) and to patient factors (e.g., lack of understanding about TB, fear of 
the authorities, and lack of access to medical services) 
(18--20). In addition, genotyping studies have revealed evidence 
of persistent transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  in  communities  that  have  implemented  highly  successful  control
measures 
(27--29), suggesting that such transmission occurred before a diagnosis was received.
Improvements in the detection of 
TB cases, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment, would bring substantial benefits to
affected patients and their 
contacts, decrease TB among children, and prevent outbreaks.
 
Deficiencies in Protecting Contacts of Person with Infectious TB and in Preventing 
and Responding to TB Outbreaks
 Although  following  up  contacts  is  among  the  highest  public  health  priorities  in
responding to a case of TB, 
problems in conducting contact investigations have been reported 
(30--32). Approaches to contact investigations vary widely 
from program to program, and traditional investigative methods are not well adapted to
certain populations at high risk. 
Only half of at-risk contacts complete a course of treatment for LTBI 
(32). Reducing the risk of TB among contacts 
through  the  development  of  better  methods  of  identification,  evaluation,  and
management would lead to substantial 
personal and public health benefits and facilitate progress toward eliminating TB in the
United States.
 Delayed detection of TB cases and suboptimal contact 
investigation can lead to TB outbreaks, which are 
increasingly  reported  (26,33--38).  Persistent  social  problems  such  as  crowding  in
homeless shelters and detention facilities 
are 
contributing factors to the upsurge in TB outbreaks. The majority of jurisdictions lack
the expertise and 
resources needed to conduct surveillance for TB outbreaks and to respond effectively
when they occur. Outbreaks have become 
an important element in the epidemiology of TB, and measures to detect, manage, and
prevent them are needed.
 
Persistence of a Substantial Population of Persons Living in the United States with LTBI 
Who Are at Risk for Progression to TB Disease
 An estimated 9.6--14.9 million persons residing in the United States have LTBI 
(39).  This  pool  of  persons  with  latent  infection  is  continually  supplemented  by
immigration from areas of the world with a high incidence of TB and 
by ongoing person-to-person transmission among certain populations at high risk. For
TB disease to be prevented 
among persons with LTBI, those at highest risk must be identified and receive curative
treatment 
(4).  Progress  toward  the  elimination  of  TB  in  the  United  States  requires  the
development of new cost-effective strategies for targeted testing 
and treatment of persons with LTBI (17,40).
 
Maintaining Clinical and Public Health Expertise in an Era of Declining TB Incidence
 Detecting a TB case, curing a person with TB, and protecting contacts of such persons
requires that clinicians and 
the staff members of public health agencies responsible for TB have specific expertise.
However, as TB becomes less 
common,  maintaining  such  expertise  throughout  the  loosely  coordinated  TB-control
system is challenging. As noted 
previously, medical errors associated with the detection of TB cases are common, and
deficiencies exist in important public 
health responsibilities such as contact investigations and outbreak response. Errors in
the treatment and management of 
TB patients continue to occur (41,42). Innovative approaches to education of medical
practitioners, new models 
for organizing TB services (2), and a clear understanding and acceptance of roles and
responsibilities by an expanded 
group of participants in TB control will be needed to ensure that the clinical and public
health expertise 
necessary to progress toward the elimination of TB are 
maintained.
Meeting the Challenges to TB Elimination
 Further  improvements  in  the  control  and  prevention  of  TB  in  the  United  States  will
require a continued strong 
public health infrastructure and involvement of a range of health professionals outside
the public health sector. The 
traditional  model  of  TB  control  in  the  United  States,  in  which  planning  and  execution
reside almost exclusively with the 
public  health  sector  (17),  is  no  longer  the  optimal  approach  during  a  sustained  drive
toward the elimination of TB. 
This  statement  emphasizes  that  success  in  controlling  TB  and  progressing  toward  its
elimination in the United States 
will  depend  on  the  integrated  activities  of  professionals  from  different  fields  in  the
health sciences. This statement 
proposes  specific  measures  to  enhance  TB  control  so  as  to  meet  the  most  important
challenges; affirms the essential role of 
the public health sector in planning, coordinating, and evaluating the effort 
(43); proposes roles and responsibilities for 
the  full  range  of  participants;  and  introduces  new  approaches  to  the  detection  of  TB
cases, contact investigations, 
and targeted testing and treatment of persons with LTBI.
 The  plan  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  TB  in  the  United  States  must  be  viewed  in  the
larger context of the global effort 
to control TB. The global TB burden is substantial and increasing. In 2000, an estimated
8.3 million (7.9--9.2 
million)  new  cases  of  TB  occurred,  and  1.84  million  (1.59--2.22  million)  persons  died
from TB; during 1997--2000, 
the worldwide TB case rate increased 1.8%/year 
(44). TB is increasing worldwide as a result of inadequate local 
resources and the global epidemic of HIV infection. In sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of TB
cases is increasing 6.4%/year 
(44). ACET (1), IOM (2), and other public health authorities 
(45,46) have acknowledged that TB will not be eliminated 
in the United States until the global epidemic is brought under control, and they have
called for greater U.S. 
involvement  in  global  control  efforts.  In  response,  CDC  and  ATS  have  become  active
participants in a multinational 
partnership (Stop TB Partnership) that was formed to guide the global efforts against
TB. U.S. public and private entities also 
have provided assistance to countries with a high burden of TB and funding for research
to develop new, improved tools 
for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, including an effective vaccine.
 Despite the global TB epidemic, substantial gains can be made toward elimination of
TB in the United States 
by focusing on improvements in existing clinical and public health practices 
(47--49).  However,  the  drive  toward  TB  elimination  in  the  United  States  will  be
resource-intensive 
(1,12). Public health agencies that plan and coordinate 
TB-
control efforts in states and communities need sufficient strength in terms of personnel,
facilities, and training 
to discharge their responsibilities successfully, and the growing number of 
nonpublic  health  contributors  to  TB  control,  all  pursuing  diverse  individual  and
institutional goals, 
should receive value for their contributions. Continued progress 
toward TB elimination in the United States will require strengthening the nation's public
health infrastructure rather 
than reducing it (1,50).
Basic Principles of TB Control in the United States
 Four prioritized strategies exist to prevent and control TB in the United States 
(17), as follows:
 The fourth strategy is to reduce the rising burden of TB from recent transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  by  identifying  settings  at  high  risk  for  transmission  and  applying
effective infection-control measures to reduce the risk. This 
strategy was used during the 1985--1992 TB resurgence, when disease attributable to
recent transmission was an 
important component of the increase in TB incidence 
(52--54). TB morbidity attributable to recent spread of 
M. tuberculosis continues to be a prominent part of the epidemiology of the disease in
the United States. Data collected by 
CDC's  National  Tuberculosis  Genotyping  and  Surveillance  Network  at  seven  sentinel
surveillance sites indicate that 44% 
of  M.  tuberculosis  isolates  from  persons  with  newly  diagnosed  cases  of  TB  were
clustered with at least one other 
intrasite isolate, often representing TB disease associated with recent spread of 
M. tuberculosis (55). TB outbreaks are also 
being reported with greater frequency in correctional facilities 
(37), homeless shelters (33), bars 
(27),  and  newly  recognized  social  settings  (e.g.,  among  persons  in  an  East  Coast
network of gay, transvestite, and transsexual HIV-infected 
men [34]; persons frequenting an abandoned junkyard building used for illicit drug use
and prostitution 
[26]; and dancers in adult entertainment clubs and their contacts, including children 
[38]).
 This  statement  provides  comprehensive  guidelines  for  the  full  spectrum  of  activities
involved in controlling 
and preventing TB in the United States. The remainder of this statement is structured in
eight sections, as follows:
 
Scientific Basis of TB Control
 M.  tuberculosis  is  nearly  always  transmitted  through  an  airborne  route,  with  the
infecting organisms being carried 
in droplets of secretions (droplet nuclei) that are expelled into the surrounding air when
a person with pulmonary 
TB coughs, talks, sings, or sneezes. Person-to-person transmission of 
M. tuberculosis is determined by certain 
characteristics of the source-case and of the person exposed to the source-person and
by the environment in which the exposure 
takes place (Box 2). The virulence of the infecting strain of 
M. tuberculosis might also be a determining factor for transmission.
 
Characteristics of the Source-Case
 By  the  time  persons  with  pulmonary  TB  come  to  medical  attention,  30%--40%  of
persons identified as their 
close personal contacts have evidence of LTBI 
(30). The highest rate of infection among contacts follows intense exposure 
to patients whose sputum smears are positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) 
(31,57--59) (Figure 2). Because patients 
with cavitary pulmonary TB are more likely than those without pulmonary cavities to be
sputum AFB smear-positive 
(60), patients with cavitary pulmonary disease have greater 
potential to transmit TB. Such persons also have a 
greater  frequency  of  cough,  so  the  triad  of  cavitary  pulmonary  disease,  sputum  AFB
smear-positivity, and frequency of cough 
are  likely  related  causal  factors  for  infectivity.  AFB  smear-negative  TB  patients  also
transmit TB, but with 
lower potential than smear-positive patients. Patients with 
sputum AFB smear-negative pulmonary TB account for 
approximately 17% of TB transmission (61).
 
Characteristics of the Exposed Person
 A study of elderly nursing home residents indicated that persons with initially positive
tuberculin skin test 
results  during  periods  of  endemic  exposure  to  TB  had  a  much  lower  risk  for  TB  than
those whose skin test results were 
initially negative (62,63). This finding suggests that preexisting LTBI confers protection
against becoming infected 
upon  subsequent  exposure  and  progression  to  active  disease.  Similarly,  having  prior
disease caused by 
M. tuberculosis had been assumed to confer protection against reinfection with a new
strain of 
M. tuberculosis. However, molecular typing 
of paired isolates of M. tuberculosis from patients with recurrent episodes of TB disease
has demonstrated that 
reinfection does occur among immunocompetent and immunocompromised 
persons (64,65).
 The classic means of protecting persons exposed to infectious diseases is vaccination.
Because of its proven efficacy 
in protecting infants and young children from meningeal and miliary TB 
(66), vaccination against TB with 
Mycobacterium bovis bacillus 
Calmette-Guerín (BCG) is used worldwide 
(although not in the United States). This protective effect 
against  the  disseminated  forms  of  TB  in  infants  and  children  is  likely  based  on  the
ability of BCG to prevent progression of 
the primary infection when administered at that stage of life 
(67). Epidemiologic evidence suggests that BCG 
immunization does not protect against the development of infection with 
M. tuberculosis upon exposure 
(68),  and  use  of  BCG  has  not  had  an  impact  on  the  global  epidemiology  of  TB.   One
recent retrospective study found that BCG protective efficacy 
can persist for 50--60 years, indicating that a single dose might have a long duration of
effect 
(69). A meta-analysis indicated that overall BCG reduced the risk for TB 50% 
(66); however, another meta-analysis that examined 
protection  over  time  demonstrated  a  decrease  in  efficacy  of  5%--14%  in  seven
randomized controlled trials and an 
increase of 18% in three others (70). An effective vaccine against 
M. tuberculosis is needed for global TB control 
to be achieved.
 Because only 30%--40% of persons with close exposure to a patient with pulmonary TB
become infected 
(30,31), innate immunity might protect certain persons from infection 
(71). The innate mechanisms that protect against 
the development of infection are largely uncharacterized 
(71). Although immunocompromised persons (e.g., those 
with  HIV  infection)  are  at  increased  risk  for  progression  to  TB  disease  after  infection
with 
M.  tuberculosis,  no  definitive  evidence  exists  that  immunocompromised  persons,
including those with HIV 
infection, have increased susceptibility to infection upon 
exposure.
 Observational studies suggest that population-based variability in susceptibility to TB
might be related to the 
length of time a population has lived in the presence of 
M. tuberculosis and has thus developed resistance to infection 
through  natural  selection  (72--74).  However,  the  genetic  basis  for  susceptibility  or
resistance to TB is not well 
understood (72,75).
 
Characteristics of the Exposure
 Studies that have stratified contacts of persons with pulmonary TB according to time
spent with the infected 
person indicate that the risk for becoming infected with 
M. tuberculosis is in part determined by the frequency and duration 
of exposure (60). In a given environment shared by a patient with pulmonary TB and a
contact, the risk for 
transmitting the infection varies with the density of infectious droplet nuclei in the air
and how long the air is inhaled. 
Indoors, tubercle bacilli are expelled into a finite volume of air, and, unless 
effective ventilation exists, droplet nuclei 
containing M. tuberculosis might remain suspended in ambient air 
(76). Exposures in confined air systems with little or 
no ventilation pose a major risk for transmission of TB; this has been demonstrated in
homes, ships, trains, office 
buildings, and health-care institutions 
(77--80). When contact occurs outdoors, TB bacilli expelled from the respiratory tract of
an  infectious  person  are  rapidly  dispersed  and  are  quickly  rendered  nonviable  by
sunlight 
(77). The risk for transmission during such 
encounters is very limited.
 Considerable attention has been given to transmission of 
M. tuberculosis during air travel. Investigations 
have demonstrated that the risk for transmission from an infectious person to others on
an airplane is greater on long 
flights (>8 hours) and that the risk for contracting 
M. tuberculosis infection is highest for passengers and flight crew 
members sitting or working near an infectious person 
(81,82). However, the overall public health importance of such events 
is negligible (77,81).
 
Virulence of the Infecting Strain of M. tuberculosis
 Although much is known about factors that contribute to the risk for transmission of 
M. tuberculosis from person to person, the role of the organism itself is only beginning
to be understood 
(83). Genetic variability is believed to affect the capability 
of  M.  tuberculosis  strains  to  be  transmitted  or  to  cause  disease  once  transmitted,  or
both. The 
M. tuberculosis W-strain family, a member of the globally spread Beijing family 
(84), is a group of clonally related multidrug-resistant organisms 
of M. tuberculosis that caused nosocomial outbreaks 
involving HIV-infected persons in New York City (NYC) during 
1991--1994  (85,86).  W-family  organisms,  which  have  also  been  associated  with  TB
outbreaks worldwide, are believed to have evolved 
from a single strain of 
M. tuberculosis that developed resistance-conferring mutations in multiple genes. The
growth of 
W-family  organisms  in  human  macrophages  is  four-  to  eightfold  higher  than  that  of
strains that cause few or no secondary cases of 
TB; this enhanced ability to replicate in human macrophages 
might contribute to the organism's potential for 
enhanced transmission (87).
 Whether M. tuberculosis loses pathogenicity as it acquires resistance to drugs is not
known. 
Isoniazid-resistant  M.  tuberculosis  strains  are  less  virulent  than  drug-susceptible
isolates in guinea pigs 
(88), and genotyping studies from San Francisco, California, and from the Netherlands
indicated that isoniazid-resistant strains are much less likely to 
be associated with clusters of TB cases than drug-susceptible strains 
(89,90). Nevertheless, because person-to-person 
spread has been demonstrated repeatedly, persons with TB with drug-resistant 
isolates should receive the same public health attention at the programmatic level as
those with drug-susceptible 
isolates (91,92).
 
Effect of Chemotherapy on Infectiousness
 Patients  with  drug-susceptible  pulmonary  and  other  forms  of  infectious  TB  rapidly
become noninfectious 
after  institution  of  effective  multiple-drug  chemotherapy.  This  principle  has  been
established by studies demonstrating 
that household contacts of persons with infectious pulmonary TB who were treated at
home after a brief period 
of 
hospitalization for institution of therapy developed LTBI at a frequency no greater than
that of persons with 
pulmonary TB who were hospitalized for 1 year 
(93) or until sputum cultures became negative 
(94). This potent effect of chemotherapy on infectiousness is likely 
attributable, at least in part, to the rapid elimination of viable 
M. tuberculosis from sputum (95) and to reduction in cough frequency 
(96). The ability of chemotherapy to eliminate 
infectivity  is  one  reason  why  detecting  infectious  cases  and  promptly  instituting
multiple-drug therapy is the primary means 
of interrupting the spread of TB in the United States.
 The effect of chemotherapy to eliminate infectiousness was once thought to 
occur rapidly, and patients on chemotherapy were thought not to be infectious 
(97,98). However, no ideal test exists to assess the infective potential 
of a TB patient on treatment, and infectivity is unlikely to disappear immediately after
multidrug therapy is 
started. Quantitative bacteriologic studies indicate that the concentration of viable 
M. tuberculosis in sputum of persons 
with cavitary sputum AFB smear-positive pulmonary TB at the time of diagnosis, which
averaged 
106--107 organisms/ml, decreased >90% 
(10-fold)  during  the  first  2  days  of  treatment,  an  effect  attributable  primarily  to
administration 
of isoniazid (99), and >99% (100-fold) by day 14--21, an effect attributable primarily to
administration of rifampin 
and pyrazinamide (100). Thus, if no factor other than the elimination of viable 
M. tuberculosis from sputum were to 
account  for  the  loss  of  infectivity  during  treatment,  the  majority  of  patients  (at  least
those with infection attributable to 
isolates susceptible to isoniazid) who have received treatment for as few as 2 days with
the standard regimen (i.e., 
isoniazid,  rifampin,  ethambutol,  and  pyrazinamide)  could  be  assumed  to  have  an
infective potential that averages 10% of that 
at the time of diagnosis. After 14--21 days of treatment, infectiousness 
averages <1% of the pretreatment level.
 This statement presents general guidelines on elimination of infectivity with treatment 
(Box  3).  However,  decisions  about  infectiousness  of  a  person  on  treatment  for  TB
should always be individualized on the basis of 1) the 
extent of illness; 2) the presence of cavitary pulmonary 
disease; 3) the degree of positivity of sputum AFB smear results; 4) 
the frequency and strength of cough; 5) the likelihood of infection with 
multidrug-resistant  organisms;  and  6)  the  nature  and  circumstances  of  the  contact
between the infected person and 
exposed contacts (101). Patients who remain 
in  hospitals  or  reside  either  temporarily  or  permanently  in  congregate  settings  (e.g.,
shelters and correctional facilities) 
are  subject  to  different  criteria  for  infectiousness.  In  such  congregate  settings,
identification and protection of close 
contacts is not possible during the early phase of treatment, and more stringent criteria
for determining absence of 
infectivity (i.e., three consecutive AFB-negative sputum smears) should be followed 
(10). All patients with suspected or proven multidrug resistant TB should be subjected
to these more stringent criteria for absence of infectivity 
(10).
 
Progression from LTBI to TB Disease
 Although  the  human  immune  response  is  highly  effective  in  controlling  primary
infection resulting from exposure 
to  M.  tuberculosis  among  the  majority  of  immunocompetent  persons,  all  viable
organisms might not be 
eliminated. M. tuberculosis is thus able to establish latency, a period during which the
infected person is asymptomatic but 
harbors M. tuberculosis organisms that might cause disease later 
(4,71). The mechanisms involved in latency and persistence 
are not completely understood (71,72).
 For the majority of persons, the only evidence of LTBI is an immune response against
mycobacterial antigens, which 
is demonstrated by a positive test result, either a tuberculin skin test 
(3) or, in certain circumstances, a whole 
blood antigen-stimulated interferon-g release assay result (e.g., 
QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test [QFT-G] [Cellestis 
Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia]). The tuberculin skin test measures delayed-type
hypersensitivity; QFT-G, an ex vivo 
test for detecting latent 
M. tuberculosis infection, measures a component of 
cell-mediated immune response (102). QFT-G 
is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and CDC will publish guidelines
on its use. CDC 
had previously published guidelines for use of 
QuantiFERON®-TB, an earlier version of the test that is no longer 
available (103). T 
SPOT-TB,® an enzyme-linked immunospot assay for 
IFN-g, is marketed in Europe along with QFT-G but 
is not FDA-approved for use in the United States. Although approved by FDA, the Tine 
Test® is not recommended for the diagnosis of 
M. tuberculosis infection. Tests available in other countries to diagnose 
M.  tuberculosis  infection  (e.g.,  T  SPOT-TB  and  Heaf  test)  are  not  recommended  for
clinical use in the United States.
 Once a person has contracted LTBI, the risk for progression to TB disease varies. The
greatest risk for progression 
to disease occurs within the first 2 years after infection, when approximately half of the
5%--10% lifetime risk 
occurs  (4,104).  Multiple  clinical  conditions  also  are  associated  with  increased  risk  for
progression from LTBI to TB 
disease. HIV infection is the strongest known risk factor 
(4). Other key risk factors because of their prevalence in the 
U.S. 
population are diabetes mellitus (105), acquisition of LTBI in infancy or early childhood,
and apical 
fibro-nodular changes on chest radiograph 
(106).
 A recent addition to the known risk factors for progression from LTBI to TB disease is
the use of therapeutic 
agents that antagonize the effect of cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNF-a) and have been proven to be highly 
effective treating autoimmune-related conditions (e.g., Crohn's disease and rheumatoid
arthritis) 
(107). Cases of TB have been reported among patients receiving all three licensed 
TNF-a antagonists (i.e., infliximab, etanercept, and 
adalimimab) (108). CDC has published interim guidelines for preventing TB when these
agents are used 
(109).
Epidemiology of TB in the United States
 Surveillance (i.e., the systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of data) is a
critical component of 
successful TB control, providing essential information needed to 
1) determine patterns and trends of the disease; 2) 
identify populations and settings at high risk; and 3) establish priorities for control and
prevention activities. Surveillance is 
also essential for quality-assurance purposes, program evaluation, and measurement of
progress toward TB elimination. 
In addition to providing the epidemiologic profile of TB in a given jurisdiction, state and
local surveillance are essential 
to national TB surveillance.
 CDC's national TB surveillance system publishes epidemiologic analyses of reported TB
cases in the United 
States (110). Data for the national TB surveillance system are reported by state health
departments in accordance 
with standard TB case-definition and case-report formats 
(110,111). The system tracked the reversal of the declining trend 
in TB incidence in the United States in the mid-1980s, the peak of the resurgence in
1992 (with a 20% increase in 
cases reported during 1985--1992), and the subsequent 44% decline to an all-time low
number (14,871) and rate (5.1 
cases/100,000 population) of TB cases in 2003 
(14,15) (Figure 1).
 
Geographic Distribution of TB
 Wide disparities exist in the geographic distribution of TB cases in the United States. In 
2003,  six  states  (California,  Florida,  Georgia,  Illinois,  New  York,  and  Texas)  each
reported 
>500 cases and accounted for 57% of the national 
total (14). These states along with New Jersey accounted for approximately 75% of the
overall decrease in cases since 
1992. The highest rates and numbers of TB cases are reported from 
urban areas; >75% of cases reported in 2003 were 
from areas with >500,000 population 
(14). In 2003, a total of 24 states (48%) had incidence of 
<3.5  cases  of  TB/100,000  population,  the  rate  established  as  the  year  2000  interim
target for the United States in the 1989 strategic plan 
for eliminating TB (11).
 
Demographic Distribution of TB
 In 2003, adults aged 15--64 years accounted for 73.6% of reported TB cases. Incidence
of TB was highest (8.4 
cases/100,000 population) among adults aged >65 years, who 
accounted for 20.2% of cases. Children aged <14 
years accounted for 6.2% of reported cases and had the lowest incidence of TB; 61.3%
of reported cases occurred among 
men,  and  case  rates  among  men  were  at  least  double  those  of  women  in  mid-  and
older-adult age groups. In 2003, the 
white, non-Hispanic population accounted for only 19% of reported cases of TB, and TB
incidence among the four 
other racial/ethnic populations for which data were available was 5.7--21.0 times that of
non-Hispanic whites 
(Table 2). Foreign-born persons accounted for 94% of TB cases among Asians and 74%
of cases among Hispanics, whereas 74% 
of cases among non-Hispanic blacks occurred among persons born in the United States 
(15).
 
Distribution of TB by Socioeconomic and Employment Status
 Socioeconomic status (SES). Low SES is associated with an increased risk for TB. An
analysis of national 
surveillance data that assigned socioeconomic indicator values on the 
basis of residence zip code indicated that the risk for 
TB increased with lower SES for six indicators (crowding, education, income, poverty,
public assistance, 
and unemployment), with crowding having the greatest impact 
(112). Risk for TB increased uniformly 
between  socioeconomic  quartile  for  each  indicator,  similar  to  other  socioeconomic
health gradients for other chronic 
diseases, except for crowding, for which risk was concentrated in the lowest quartile.
Adjusting for SES accounted 
for 
approximately  half  of  the  increased  risk  for  TB  associated  with  race/ethnicity  among
U.S.-born blacks, 
Hispanics, and American Indians (112).
 Occupation.  Increased  incidence  of  TB  among  persons  with  certain  occupations  is
attributable to exposure in the 
work  environment  and  to  an  increased  likelihood  that  workers  will  have  other  risk
factors unrelated to occupation, such 
as foreign birth. A 29-state study of patients with clinically active TB 
reported during 1984--1985 indicated that 
increased incidence was independent of occupation. An 
association between general SES groupings of occupations and risk for 
TB  also  was  demonstrated  in  that  study  (113).  Chronically  unemployed  persons  had
high incidence of TB; this finding 
is consistent with surveillance data indicating that >50% of TB 
patients were unemployed during the 2 years before 
diagnosis (14).
 TB among health-care workers (HCWs). Because transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in health-care institutions was 
a  contributing  factor  to  the  resurgence  of  TB  during  1985--1992,  recommendations
were developed to 
prevent  transmission  in  these  settings  (10).  In  2003,  persons  reported  to  have  been
HCWs in the 2 years before receiving 
their diagnoses accounted for 3.1% of reported TB cases nationwide 
(14). However, the elevated risk among HCWs might 
be attributable to other factors (e.g., birth in a country with a high incidence of TB) 
(114).  A  multistate  occupational  survey  indicated  that  the  majority  of  HCWs  did  not
have a higher risk for TB than the general population; 
respiratory therapists, however, did appear to be at greater risk 
(113).
 
Identification of Populations at High Risk for TB
 Contacts  of  infectious  persons.  A  high  prevalence  of  TB  disease  and  LTBI  has  been
documented among close 
contacts of persons with infectious pulmonary TB 
(31). A study of approximately 1,000 persons from urban sites 
with  pulmonary  AFB  sputum  smear-positive  TB  indicated  that  more  than  one  third  of
their contacts had positive 
tuberculin skin tests and that 2% of all close contacts had active TB. Contacts identified
with TB disease were more likely to 
be household members or children aged <6 years 
(31).
 Foreign-born persons. The proportion of TB cases in the United States occurring among
foreign-born 
persons increased progressively during the 1990s; in 2003, 
persons born outside the United States accounted for 53% 
of  reported  cases  (14)  (Figure  3).  Although  foreign-born  persons  who  received  a
diagnosis of TB in 2002 were born 
in >150 countries worldwide, as in each of the 6 previous years, five countries of origin
accounted for the greatest 
number of foreign-born persons with TB: China (5%), 
India (8%), Mexico (26%), the Philippines (12%), and Vietnam 
(8%). During 1992--2003, the number of states in which 
>50% of the total reported cases occurred among 
foreign-born persons increased from four (8%) in 1992 to 24 (48%) in 2003 
(15). Among states and cities, however, this profile 
can change rapidly, reflecting changes in patterns 
of immigration and refugee settlement (21).
 Surveillance data indicate that incidence of TB among 
foreign-born persons is approximately 23 
cases/100,000 population (14). Incidence varied by county of origin, 
appearing to reflect incidence of TB in the country of 
birth  (21,115,116).  In  2003,  approximately  47%  of  foreign-born  persons  with  TB
received their diagnoses within 5 years 
of their arrival in the United States, and 19% received their diagnoses within 
1  year  of  arrival.  Among  foreign-born  persons,  TB  case  rates  decreased  with  longer
duration of residence in the United States. TB rates were nearly four times 
higher  among  persons  residing  in  the  United  States  for  <5  years  than  in  those  who
were residents for 
>5 years (115,116).
 HIV-infected persons. Because reporting of HIV infection among persons with TB is not
complete, the 
exact prevalence of HIV infection among such persons is 
unknown. During 1993--2001, the prevalence of reported 
HIV  infection  occurring  among  persons  also  reported  with  TB  decreased  from  15%  to
8% 
(14); this decrease has been attributed, in part, to reduced transmission of TB among
HIV-infected persons 
(16). According to a recent worldwide epidemiologic assessment, however, 26% of adult
TB 
cases in the United States are attributable to HIV infection 
(44).
 Homeless persons. In 2003, persons known to have been homeless in the year before
receiving a diagnosis 
accounted  for  6.3%  of  cases  of  TB  nationwide.  On  the  basis  of  available  population
estimates 
(117),  incidence  of  TB  among  homeless  persons  is  approximately  30--40/100,000
population, more than five times the national case rate. However, 
a  prospective  study  of  a  cohort  of  approximately  3,000  homeless  persons  in  San
Francisco documented an 
annual incidence of >250 cases/100,000 population 
(118). In addition, outbreaks of TB linked to overnight shelters 
continue 
to occur among homeless persons and likely contribute to the increased incidence of TB
among that 
population (119,120).
 Other populations at high risk. In 2003, persons known to have injected drugs in the
year before receiving 
a diagnosis accounted for 2.2% of reported cases of TB, and noninjection drug use was
reported by 7.3% of persons 
with TB. In certain U.S. communities, injection drug use is sufficiently prevalent so as to
constitute a high risk 
for  epidemiologic  importance  rather  than  simply  an  individual  risk  factor,  especially
when overlap exists between 
injection drug use and HIV infection 
(121,122).
 
TB Among Detainees and Prisoners in Correctional Facilities
 The  proportion  of  cases  of  TB  occurring  among  inmates  of  prisons  and  jails  has
remained stable at 
approximately 3%--4% since data began to be collected in 1993; it was 3.2% in 2003 
(14). Inmates also have high incidence of 
TB, with rates often >200/100,000 population 
(123), and they have a disproportionately greater number of risk factors 
for TB (e.g., low SES, HIV infection, and substance abuse) compared with the 
general  population  (124,125).  TB  transmission  in  correctional  facilities  contributes  to
the greater risk among those populations, presumably because of 
the  difficulties  in  detecting  cases  of  infectious  TB  and  in  identifying,  evaluating,  and
treating contacts in these 
settings (37,126).
 TB outbreaks occur in both prison and jail settings. Dedicated housing units for prison
inmates with HIV 
infection were sites of transmission in California in 1995 
(126) and South Carolina in 1999 and in South Carolina in 1999 
(37). In the South Carolina outbreak, delayed diagnosis and isolation of an inmate who
apparently had active TB 
after  entering  the  facility  led  to  >15  outbreak  cases.  Transmission  leading  to  TB
infection in the community also 
was documented in an outbreak that occurred in a jail in Tennessee during 1995--1997 
(127,128)  that  involved  approximately  40  inmates;  contact  investigations  were
incomplete because of brief jail terms and frequent movement 
of  inmates.  During  the  same  period,  43%  of  patients  with  TB  in  the  surrounding
community had previously 
been incarcerated in that jail (127), and, after 
2 years, the jail outbreak strain was more prevalent in the community than 
it  was  during  the  jail  outbreak.  Genotyping  studies  indicated  that  the  outbreak  strain
accounted for approximately 25% 
of  TB  cases  in  the  community,  including  those  among  patients  with  no  history  of
incarceration 
(128).
Contributions of Genotyping of M. tuberculosis
 M. tuberculosis genotyping refers to procedures developed to identify 
M. tuberculosis isolates that are identical in 
specific parts of the genome (83). To date, 
M. tuberculosis genotyping has been based on polymorphisms in the number 
and  genomic  location  of  mycobacterial  repetitive  elements.  The  most  widely  used
genotyping test for 
M.  tuberculosis  is  restriction  fragment  length  polymorphism  (RFLP)  analysis  of  the
distribution of the insertion sequence IS6110 
(129).  However,  genotyping  tests  based  on  polymorphisms  in  three  additional
mycobacterial repetitive 
elements (i.e., polymorphic guanine cytosine--rich repetitive sequences, direct repeats
[e.g., spoligotyping], 
and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units [MIRU]) have also been developed 
(83). M. tuberculosis isolates with 
identical DNA patterns in an established genotyping test 
often have been linked through recent transmission among the 
persons from whom they were isolated.
 When coupled with traditional epidemiologic investigations, analyses of the genotype
of 
M.  tuberculosis  strains  have  confirmed  suspected  transmission  and  identified
unsuspected transmission of 
M. tuberculosis. These analyses have 
also  identified  risk  factors  for  recent  infection  with  rapid  progression  to  disease,
demonstrated exogenous reinfection 
with different strains, identified weaknesses in conventional contact investigations, and
documented the existence 
of laboratory cross-contamination. Genotyping has become an increasingly useful tool
for studying the 
pathogenesis, epidemiology, and transmission of TB.
 
Epidemiology of TB Among Contacts in Outbreak Settings
 Conventional  contact  investigations  have  used  the  concentric  circles  approach  to
collect information and 
screen household contacts, coworkers, and increasingly distant contacts for TB infection
and disease 
(17). The concentric circles model has been described previously 
(130). However, this method might not always be adequate in 
out-of-household settings. In community-based studies from San Francisco 
(131), Zurich (132), and Amsterdam 
(133), only 5%--10% of 
persons  with  clustered  IS6110-based  genotyping  patterns  were  identified  as  contacts
by the source-person in the 
cluster. This finding indicates that either 1) transmission of 
M. tuberculosis might occur more commonly than suspected and 
is not easily detected by conventional contact tracing investigations or 
2) genotype clustering does not necessarily 
represent recent transmission (55). Because genotyping studies discover only missed or
mismanaged contacts (i.e., those 
that subsequently receive a diagnosis of TB), such studies cannot explain the successes
of the process or the number of 
cases that were prevented.
 Certain  populations  (e.g.,  the  urban  homeless)  present  specific  challenges  to
conducting conventional 
contact  investigations.  Genotyping  studies  have  provided  information  about  chains  of
transmission in these 
populations (118,119). In a prospective study of TB transmission in Los Angeles, the 
degree of homelessness and use of daytime services at three shelters were factors that
were independently associated with genotype clustering 
(119). Additional studies support the idea that specific locations can be associated with
recent or ongoing transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  among  homeless  persons.  Two  studies  among  predominantly
HIV-infected men have demonstrated evidence 
of transmission at specific bars in the community 
(134,135).
 Genotyping techniques have confirmed TB transmission in HIV residential facilities 
(136), crack houses (i.e., settings in which crack cocaine is sold or used) 
(137), hospitals and clinics (54), and prisons 
(138,139). TB transmission also has been demonstrated among church choirs 
(140) and renal transplant patients 
(141) and in association with processing of contaminated medical waste 
(142) and with bronchoscopy (143,144).
 
Communitywide Epidemiology of TB
 TB might arise because of rapid progression from a 
recently acquired M. tuberculosis infection, from progression 
of LTBI to TB disease, or occasionally from exogenous reinfection 
(145). The majority of genotyping studies have 
assumed  that  clustered  isolates  in  a  population-based  survey  reflect  recent
transmission of 
M. tuberculosis. Certain studies have identified epidemiologic links between clustered
TB cases, inferring that the clustered cases are part of a chain 
of transmission from a single common source or from multiple common sources 
(131,146).
 The  number  and  proportion  of  population-based  cases  of  TB  that  occur  in  clusters
representing recent or 
ongoing transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  have  varied  from  study  to  study;  frequency  of  clustering  has  varied
from 17%--18% 
(in Vancouver, Canada) to 30%--40% (in U.S. urban areas) 
(131,147,148). Youth, being a member of a racial or 
ethnic  minority  population,  homelessness,  substance  abuse,  and  HIV  infection  have
been associated with clustering 
(131,133, 148,149).
 The increasing incidence of TB among foreign-born persons underscores the need to
understand 
transmission  dynamics  among  this  population.  In  San  Francisco,  two  parallel  TB
epidemics have been described 
(150,151),  one  among  foreign-born  persons  that  was  characterized  by  a  low  rate  of
genotype clustering and the other among 
U.S-born  persons  that  was  characterized  by  a  high  rate  of  genotype  clustering.  In  a
recent study from NYC, being born 
outside the United States, being aged >60 years, and receiving a diagnosis 
after 1993 were factors independently associated 
with being infected with a strain not matched with any other, whereas homelessness
was associated with genotype 
clustering and recent transmission (152). Among foreign-born persons, clustered strains
were more likely to be found 
among patients with HIV infection (152).
 
Other Contributions of Genotyping
 Genotyping can determine whether a patient with a 
recurrent episode of TB has relapsed with the original strain 
of M. tuberculosis or has developed exogenous reinfection with a new strain 
(64,153). In Cape Town, South Africa, where incidence of TB is high and considerable
ongoing transmission 
exists, 16 (2.3%) of 698 patients had more than 
one episode of TB disease. In 12 (75%) of the 16 recurrent cases, the pairs of 
M. tuberculosis isolates had different 
IS6110-based genotyping patterns, indicating exogenous 
reinfection (154). However, in areas with a low incidence of 
TB, episodes of exogenous reinfection are uncommon 
(153). Because TB incidence in the majority of areas of the 
United States is low and decreasing, reinfection is unlikely to be a major cause of TB
recurrence.
 Genotyping has greatly facilitated the identification of false-positive cultures for 
M. tuberculosis resulting from laboratory cross-contamination of specimens. Previously,
false-positive cultures (which might lead to 
unnecessary  treatment  for  patients,  unnecessary  work  for  public  health  programs  in
investigating cases and pseudo-outbreaks, 
and unnecessary costs to the health-care system) were difficult to substantiate 
(155). Because of its capability to 
determine 
clonality  among  M.  tuberculosis  strains,  genotyping  has  been  applied  extensively  to
verify suspected 
false-positive cultures (156--158) and to study the causes and prevalence of laboratory 
cross-contamination (159,160).
 
The Role of Genotyping of 
M. tuberculosis in TB-Control Programs
 In 2004, CDC established the Tuberculosis Genotyping Program (TBGP) to enable rapid
genotyping of isolates 
from every patient in the United States with culture-positive TB 
(161). State TB programs may submit one 
M.  tuberculosis  isolate  from  each  culture-positive  case  within  their  jurisdictions  to  a
contracted genotyping laboratory. A 
detailed manual describing this program, including information on how to 
interpret genotyping test results and how to 
integrate genotyping into TB-control activities, has been published 
(162).
 Genotyping  information  is  essential  to  optimal  TB  control  in  two  settings.  First,
genotyping is integral to 
the detection and control of TB outbreaks, including ruling a suspected outbreak in or
out and pinpointing involved cases 
and the site or sites of transmission 
(54,136--144). Second, genotyping is essential 
to detect errors in handling and processing of 
M. tuberculosis isolates (including laboratory 
cross-contamination) that lead to reports of 
false-positive cultures for 
M. tuberculosis 
(156,158--160,163).
 More extensive use of 
M. tuberculosis genotyping for TB control depends on the availability of sufficient 
program resources to compare results with information from traditional epidemiologic
investigative techniques. 
Time-framed  genotyping  surveys  and  good  fieldwork  can  unravel  uncertainties  in  the
epidemiology of TB in problematic 
populations at high risk (150--152,164). Genotyping surveys and epidemiologic 
investigations  also  can  be  used  as  a  program  monitoring  tool  to  determine  the
adequacy of contact 
investigations (29,119,132--134,164--166) and evaluate 
the success of control measures designed to interrupt transmission of 
M. tuberculosis among certain populations 
or settings (167).
 Programs that use genotyping for surveillance of all of the jurisdiction's 
M. tuberculosis isolates should work closely 
on an ongoing basis with the genotyping laboratory and commit sufficient resources to
compare genotyping results 
with those of traditional epidemiologic investigations. Information from both sources is
needed for optimum interpretation 
of the complex epidemiologic patterns of TB in the United States 
(84,168).
Principles and Practice of TB Control
Basic Principles of TB Control
 The goal of TB control in the United States is to reduce morbidity and mortality caused
by TB by 1) 
preventing transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  from  persons  with  contagious  forms  of  the  disease  to  uninfected
persons and 2) 
preventing progression from LTBI to TB disease among persons who have contracted 
M. tuberculosis infection. Four 
fundamental strategies are used to achieve this goal 
(Box 4) (17,169), as follows:
 Vaccination  with  BCG  is  not  recommended  as  a  means  to  control  TB  in  the  United
States because of the 
unproved efficacy of the vaccine in the U.S. population 
(174,175), its effect of confounding the results of tuberculin 
skin testing (176) and the success of other measures in reducing incidence of TB 
(16).  During  the  1985--1992  TB  resurgence,  the  documented  spread  of  TB,  including
multidrug-resistant TB, in health-care institutions and in 
the  community  (52--54,177,178)  stimulated  interest  in  the  potential  use  of  BCG  to
protect HCWs and others 
from  exposure  to  M.  tuberculosis.  In  1996,  a  statement  from  ACET  and  the  Advisory
Committee on Immunization 
Practices (179) recommended vaccination with BCG for 1) 
infants and children with exposure to 
M. tuberculosis in settings in which other protective measures are either inaccessible or
proven to be 
ineffective and 2) HCWs when likelihood of exposure to multidrug-resistant TB is high
and recommended control measures have not been successful. With 
improved TB control in the United States and the decline of 
multidrug-resistant TB (13), use of BCG for protection against 
TB has declined. An improved vaccine, particularly one that protects adults with LTBI
against 
acquiring  TB  disease,  would  accelerate  progress  toward  TB  elimination  in  the  United
States 
(180).
Deficiencies in TB Control
 Because TB control is a complex undertaking that 
involves multiple participants and processes, mistakes 
often occur, with adverse consequences. Common errors 
include 1) delays among persons with active TB obtaining health 
care; 2) delayed detection and diagnosis of active TB; 3) failed or delayed reporting of
TB; 4) failure to complete an 
effective 
course of treatment for TB; 5) missed opportunities 
to prevent TB among children; and 6) deficiencies in 
conducting contact investigations and in recognizing 
and responding to outbreaks.
 
Delays in Obtaining Health Care
 Homeless patients with TB symptoms often delay seeking care or experience delays in
gaining access to care 
(181), and fear of immigration authorities has been associated with 
patient delay among foreign-born persons 
(19). Patients who speak languages other than English or who are aged 55--64 years
are more likely than others to delay seeking care 
(20).
 Cultural  factors  that  might  affect  health-seeking  behavior  by  foreign-born  persons
include misinterpretation 
or minimization of symptoms, self-care by using over-the-counter or folk medicines, and
the social stigma associated 
with TB (18). In certain societies, women with TB are less likely to take advantage of
health-care services, perhaps because 
of stigma associated with the diagnosis, including a lower likelihood of marriage 
(182,183). Even in areas with open access to public health clinical services, persons at
risk for TB might not seek evaluation and treatment because they are 
not aware that these resources are available for persons with limited financial means 
(118,184--186).
 
Delayed Detection and Diagnosis of Active TB
 Delayed detection of a case of TB and resulting delays in initiation of treatment can
occur if the clinician does 
not suspect the diagnosis. A survey conducted in NYC in 1994 found that the median
delay within the health-care 
system (defined as the time from first contact to initiation of treatment for active TB)
was 15 days (range: 0--430 days) 
(20). Asians and homeless persons were more likely to encounter delays in 
receiving a diagnosis than non-Asians and 
persons with stable housing. Persons without cough who had AFB smear-negative TB or
who did not have a chest radiograph 
at their initial visit also experienced delays. In London, England, 
delays in diagnosis occurred among whites and 
among women of all racial/ethnic populations 
(187).
 Regardless of the reason, the consequences of delays in 
diagnosis and initiation of effective therapy can be serious. 
In  Maine,  a  shipyard  worker  aged  32  years  who  was  a  TB  contact  and  who  was
untreated despite having symptoms 
of active TB, repeated medical visits, and a chest radiograph consistent with active TB
did not receive a diagnosis of 
TB  until  8  months  after  he  became  ill  (188),  and  21  additional  cases  of  TB  occurred
among his contacts. Of 9,898 
persons who were investigated as contacts, 697 (7.0%) persons received 
diagnoses of new LTBIs. A high school student in 
California was symptomatic for >1 year before TB was diagnosed 
(177). Subsequently, 12 additional TB cases 
among fellow students were linked to the source-case, and 292 (23%) of 1,263 
students tested had positive tuberculin skin tests.
 Other instances of delayed or missed diagnoses of TB have been reported that have
resulted in extended periods 
of  infectiousness  and  deaths  (22,24,178).  These  problems  reflect  the  increasing
difficulty in maintaining 
clinical expertise in the recognition of TB in the face of declining disease incidence 
(41).  Recognition  of  TB  among  patients  with  AFB-negative  sputum  smear  results  is  a
challenge for practitioners and has been associated with delays in reporting 
and treatment (22,189,190).
 
Delayed Reporting of TB
 Failure to promptly report a new TB case delays public health 
responses (e.g., institution of a treatment plan, 
case-management  services,  and  protection  of  contacts).  Although  TB  cases  in  the
United States rarely remain 
unreported, timeliness of reporting varies (median: 7--38 days) 
(190).
 
Failure to Receive and Complete a Standard Course of Treatment for Active TB
 Failure  to  receive  and  complete  a  standard  course  of  treatment  for  TB  has  adverse
consequences, including 
treatment  failure,  relapse,  increased  TB  transmission,  and  the  emergence  of
drug-resistant TB 
(191--193).  At  least  two  reasons  exist  for  failure  to  complete  standard  treatment.
Patients frequently fail to adhere to the lengthy course of treatment 
(188). Poor adherence to treatment regimens might result from difficulties with access
to the health-care system, 
cultural factors, homelessness, substance abuse, lack of social support, rapid clearing
of symptoms, or forgetfulness 
(18,194).  Also,  as  TB  has  become  less  common,  clinicians  might  fail  to  use  current
treatment regimens 
(48).  These  adverse  outcomes  are  preventable  by  case-management  strategies
provided by TB-control programs, 
including use of DOT (13,195,196).
 
Missed Opportunities To Prevent TB Among Children
 The  absence  of  TB  infection  and  disease  among  children  is  a  key  indicator  of  a
community's success in 
interrupting  the  transmission  of  TB  (197).  The  1985--1992  TB  resurgence  included  a
reversal of the long-term decline in 
the  incidence  of  TB  among  children,  which  indicated  a  failure  of  the  public  health
system to prevent disease 
transmission (197). A study of 165 children reported with TB in California in 1994 found
that for 59 (37%), an adult 
source-case  was  identified  (198).  Factors  that  contributed  to  transmission  to  children
included delayed reporting, delayed 
initiation  of  contact  investigations,  and  poor  management  of  adult  source-cases.
Improvements in contact investigations 
might have prevented 17 (10%) of those cases 
(198).
 
Deficiencies in Conducting Contact Investigations and in Recognizing and Responding 
to Outbreaks
 Deficiencies  in  contact  investigations  and  failure  to  recognize  and  respond  to  TB
outbreaks are among the 
most important challenges to optimal control of TB in the United States. These topics
are discussed in detail in this 
statement along with the other essential components of TB control.
Importance of TB Training and Education
 The 1985--1992 TB resurgence led ACET to call for a 
renewed focus on training and education as an integral part 
of strategies for TB control, prevention, and elimination 
(1). Factors indicating a need for this focus include the following:
 
Educating Patients and Communities at High Risk
 Education of patients by clinicians, TB program staff, and trusted community members
promotes acceptance 
and  adherence  to  authoritative  advice  about  controlling  and  preventing  TB.  Such
education can influence patients' 
decision-making about whether to accept and complete treatment for LTBI 
(202).
 Because cultural and health beliefs might act as barriers to effective control of TB 
(18,19), an increasing need exists for education targeted at populations at high risk 
(19). TB-control programs should enlist community-based 
organizations and other key informants to discover the health 
beliefs, norms, and values of communities at high risk in 
their  jurisdictions  (202,203).  Professional  associations  and  academic  institutions
(including schools of medicine, 
public health, and nursing) will be valuable partners in developing an understanding of
the health perceptions of 
these populations. Education materials should be developed with input from the target
audience to ensure that they 
are culturally and linguistically appropriate 
(203,204).
 
The Strategic Plan for TB Training and Education
 In 1997, CDC funded a project to develop a Strategic Plan for Tuberculosis Training and
Education (the 
Strategic  Plan)  that  provided  guidance  to  agencies  and  organizations  in  the  United
States that offer TB training and education 
for  public-  and  private-sector  providers.  The  Strategic  Plan  specified  critical  areas
requiring attention, 
including  1)  the  need  for  culturally  competent  programs  and  materials,  2)  effective
methods and technologies, 3) collaboration 
and cooperation among training and education partners outside TB-control programs,
and 4) adequate funding for 
training and education efforts.
 
Other Resources for TB Training and Education
 Substantial progress has been made in developing and disseminating resources for TB
training and education. 
CDC  and  national  TB  centers,  NTCA,  regional  controllers  associations  (e.g.,  the
Northeast Tuberculosis 
Training Consortium), state and local health departments, and the National Laboratory
Training Network have all 
conducted education programs or developed training and education materials. In 2001,
as stipulated by the Strategic Plan, 
the  Tuberculosis  Education  and  Training  Network  was  established.  The  network  is
coordinated by CDC and 
includes  educators  in  local,  state,  and  territorial  health  agencies.  CDC  has  also
developed the 
Tuberculosis Information CD-ROM, Version 3, and the 
Tuberculosis Education and Training Resource Guide; these products are designed to 
enhance awareness and accessibility of resources (available at
http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/tb/default.htm) for TB education 
and training. The establishment in 2004 of the National 
Tuberculosis Curriculum Coordinating Center at the University 
of  California  at  San  Diego  by  the  National  Heart  Lung  and  Blood  Institute  signals  a
commitment by the 
National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  to  provide  basic  TB  education  for  health-care
students and providers.
 Professional  societies  and  specialty  boards  are  means  for  reaching  private  medical
providers. Including TB as a subject 
in state medical society programs, hospital grand rounds, and medical specialty board
examinations would be a 
valuable resource for providers serving populations at low risk. New linkages should be
established to reach 
providers  serving  populations  at  high  risk  (e.g.,  foreign-born,  homeless,  and
HIV-infected persons). For example, the AIDS 
Education  and  Training  Centers  funded  by  the  Health  Resources  and  Services
Administration are a 
resource for reaching HIV/AIDS providers, and foreign physicians' associations and 
community-based organizations are potential partners for 
reaching  international  medical  graduates  and  health-care  providers  of  foreign-born
persons.
Laboratory Services for Optimal TB Control
 The  diagnosis  of  TB,  management  of  patients  with  the  disease,  and  public  health
control services rely on 
accurate laboratory tests. Laboratory services are an essential component of effective
TB control, providing key information 
to clinicians (for patient care) and public health agencies (for control 
services).
 Up to 80% of all initial TB-related laboratory work (e.g., smear and culture inoculation)
is performed in 
hospitals,  clinics,  and  independent  laboratories  outside  the  public  health  system,
whereas >50% of species identification and 
drug susceptibility testing is performed in public health laboratories 
(205). Thus, effective TB control requires a network 
of  public  and  private  laboratories  to  optimize  laboratory  testing  and  the  flow  of
information. Public health laboratorians, 
as 
a component of the public health sector with a mandate for TB control, should take a
leadership role in 
developing laboratory networks and in facilitating communication among laboratorians,
clinicians, and TB controllers.
 
Role of Public Health Laboratories
 Public  health  laboratories  should  ensure  that  clinicians  and  public  health  agencies
within their 
jurisdictions have ready access to reliable laboratory tests for diagnosis and treatment
of TB 
(206). Specific tasks to ensure the 
availability, accessibility, and quality of essential laboratory services are 1) assessment
of the cost and availability of TB 
laboratory services and 2) development of strategic plans to implement and maintain a
systems approach to TB testing 
(207).  In  this  process,  public  health  laboratories  should  assess  and  monitor  the
competence of laboratories that perform 
any testing related to the diagnosis, management, and control of TB within their 
jurisdictions;  develop  guidelines  for  reporting  and  tracking  of  laboratory  results;  and
educate laboratory staff members, health-care providers, and 
public  health  officials  about  available  laboratory  tests,  new  technologies,  and
indications for their use. For example, 
public  health  laboratories  should  lead  the  discussion  on  the  costs,  logistics
requirements (e.g., collection and transport 
of clinical specimens within the required time), and quality assurance issues associated
with the use of QFT-G, the 
new test for latent M. tuberculosis infection 
(103). The process of coordinating TB laboratory services is usually best 
organized at the state level (208), and the Association of Public Health Laboratories has
compiled descriptions 
of successful organizational models for integrated laboratory 
services (207).
 
Role of Clinical Laboratories
 Because the majority of initial TB laboratory work 
related to diagnosis of TB is conducted in hospitals, clinics, 
and  independent  laboratories  (205),  clinicians  and  public  health  agencies  are
increasingly dependent on the 
laboratory sector for the confirmation of reported cases, and public health laboratories
are similarly dependent for 
referral  of  specimens  for  confirmatory  testing  and  archiving.  However,  as  a  result  of
laboratory consolidation at the 
regional or national level (206), private laboratories are 
experiencing more difficulties in fulfilling this function. In certain 
instances,  consolidation  has  resulted  in  poor  communication  among  laboratory
personnel, clinicians, and public health 
agencies  (206,209).  Problems  also  have  been  identified  in  specimen  transport,  test
result reporting, and quality 
control (206,209,210). In response, certain states (e.g., 
Wisconsin*) have adopted laws and regulations that mandate 
essential clinical laboratory services for TB control (e.g., drug susceptibility testing and
reporting of the first 
M. tuberculosis isolate from each patient and submission of isolates to the state public
health laboratory).
 The  clinical  laboratory  sector  should  accept  the  responsibilities  that  accompany  its
emergence as a provider 
of  essential  TB  testing  (209).  This  statement  provides  recommendations  to  guide
turnaround times for essential 
tests,  reporting  to  clinicians  and  jurisdictional  public  health  agencies,  and  referral  of
specimens to public health laboratories 
or their designees.
 
Essential Laboratory Tests
 Six tests performed in clinical microbiologic laboratories are recommended for optimal
TB control services 
(Table 3). These laboratory tests should be available to every clinician involved in TB
diagnosis and management and 
to jurisdictional public health agencies charged with TB control. In addition, other tests
that are useful in the 
diagnosis  and  management  of  selected  patients  and  for  specific  TB  control  activities
include 
M.  tuberculosis  genotyping,  serum  drug  levels,  tests  used  for  monitoring  for  drug
toxicity, and QFT-G for diagnosis of 
latent M. tuberculosis infection 
(5,103,162). Access to these specialized tests should be provided as needed.
 For  suspected  cases  of  pulmonary  TB,  sputum  smears  for  AFB  provide  a  reliable
indication of potential 
infectiousness;  and  for  AFB  smear-positive  pulmonary  cases,  a  nucleic  acid
amplification assay (NAA) provides rapid confirmation 
that the infecting mycobacteria are from the 
M. tuberculosis complex. These two tests, which should be available with 
rapid  turnaround  times  from  specimen  collection,  facilitate  decisions  about  initiating
treatment for TB or a 
non-TB  pulmonary  infection,  and,  if  TB  is  diagnosed,  for  reporting  the  case  and
establishing priority to the 
contact investigation.
 Growth detection and identification of 
M. tuberculosis by culture of sputum and other affected tissue is essential 
for confirmation of the identity of the organism and for subsequent drug susceptibility
testing, which is recommended 
on 
all  initial  isolates  for  each  patient.  Cultures  also  remain  the  cornerstone  for  the
diagnosis of TB in 
smear-negative pulmonary and extrapulmonary cases and, along with sputum smears
for AFB, provide the basis for monitoring 
a  patient's  response  to  treatment,  for  release  from  isolation,  and  for  diagnosing
treatment failure and relapse 
(5). The use of liquid media systems, which can provide information in less time than
solid media (in certain cases, 7 days), 
should be available in all laboratories that perform culture for mycobacteria. Detailed
descriptions of these 
recommended  laboratory  tests;  recommendations  for  their  correct  use;  and  methods
for collecting, handling, and 
transporting specimens have been published 
(3,211).
Recommended Roles and Responsibilities for TB Control
 This section delineates organizational and operational 
responsibilities of the public health sector that are essential 
to achieve the goals of TB control in the United States. However, a central premise of
this statement is that 
continuing  progress  toward  elimination  of  TB  in  the  United  States  will  require  the
collaborative efforts of a broad range of 
persons,  organizations,  and  institutions  in  addition  to  the  public  health  sector,  which
has responsibility for the enterprise. 
For  example,  clinicians  who  provide  primary  health  care  and  other  specialized  health
services to patients at high risk for 
TB,  academic  medical  centers  that  educate  and  train  them,  hospitals  in  which  they
practice, and professional 
organizations  that  serve  their  interests  can  all  make  meaningful  contributions  to
improve the detection of TB cases, one of the 
most important obstacles to continuing progress (Box 1). Similarly, important roles exist
for such entities as 
community-based  organizations  representing  populations  at  risk  for  TB  and  the
pharmaceutical industry, which takes 
academic advances and develops the tools for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
TB. This section discusses the importance 
to the TB elimination effort of participants outside the public health sector and proposes
specific roles 
and  responsibilities  that  each  could  fulfill  toward  that  goal.  The  sponsoring
organizations intend for these proposals to 
serve  as  the  basis  for  discussion  and  consensus  building  on  the  important  roles  and
responsibilities of the nonpublic 
health sector in continuing progress toward the elimination of TB in the United States.
Public Health Sector
 The infrastructure for TB control has been discussed 
extensively in recent years. An analysis of contributing factors 
to the rise in the number of TB cases during 1985--1992 concluded that the resurgence
never would have occurred 
had the public health infrastructure been left in place and supported appropriately 
(212).  The  need  to  maintain  the  TB-control  infrastructure  has  been  expressed
repeatedly 
(1,2,13,213,214).
 Public  health  activities  have  been  described  as  consisting  of  four  interrelated
components: mission/purpose, 
structural capacity, processes, and outcomes 
(215). Among these four components, structural capacity (i.e., persons who do 
the work of public health, their skills and capacities, the places where they work, the
way they are organized, the 
equipment and systems available to them, and the fiscal resources they 
command) represents the public health infrastructure 
for TB control.
 The  responsibility  for  TB  control  and  prevention  in  the  United  States  rests  with  the
public health system 
through federal, state, county, and local public health agencies. Programs conducted by
these agencies were critical to 
the progress that has been made in TB control, and the deterioration of those programs
following the loss of categoric 
federal  funding  contributed  to  the  resurgence  of  TB  in  the  United  States  during
1985--1992 
(1,2,13,212--214). Since 1992, as a result of 
increased  funding  for  TB-control  programs,  national  incidence  of  TB  disease  has
declined. In 2004, 
$147  million  in  federal  funds  were  dedicated  to  domestic  TB  control,  compared  with
$6.6 million in 1989, during 
the resurgence. These funds have been used to rebuild 
public health--based TB-control systems, and the success 
achieved highlights the critical role of the public health system in TB control.
 TB  control  in  the  United  States  has  traditionally  been  conducted  through  categoric
programs established 
to address the medical aspects of the disease and the specific interventions required
for its successful prevention 
and management (17,216). CDC's Division of TB Elimination, in partnership with other
CDC entities that conduct 
TB-related  work,  provides  guidance  and  oversight  to  state  and  local  jurisdictions  by
conducting nationwide 
surveillance;  developing  national  policies,  priorities,  and  guidelines;  and  providing
funding, direct assistance, education, and 
program 
evaluation. Setting the national agenda for support of basic and clinical research is also
a critical function of 
federal  health  agencies,  including  NIH  and  CDC,  with  support  from  nongovernment
organizations such as ATS and IDSA.
 To meet the priorities of basic TB control (Box 4), state and local public health agencies
with responsibility for 
TB control should provide or ensure the provision of a core group of functions 
(Box  5).  Jurisdictional  public  health  agencies  should  ensure  that  competent  services
providing these core elements function adequately within their jurisdictions 
and are available with minimal barriers to all residents.
 How  the  core  components  of  TB  control  are  organized  differs  among  jurisdictions,
depending on the local burden 
of  disease,  the  overall  approach  to  public  health  services  within  the  jurisdiction,
budgetary considerations, the 
availability of services within and outside the public health sector, and the relationships
among potential participants. 
Certain  jurisdictions  provide  core  program  components  themselves,  whereas  other
jurisdictions contract with others to 
provide  them.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  the  organization  includes  a  mix  in  which  the
public health agency provides 
certain  services,  contracts  for  others,  and  works  collaboratively  with  partners  and
stakeholders to accomplish the remainder 
(48).  Sharing  of  direct  services,  including  patient  management,  increases  the
importance of the public health sector, 
which retains responsibility for success of the process. This evolving role of the public
health sector in TB control is 
consistent with the widely accepted concept of the three core functions of public health
that IOM proposed in 1988: 
assessment, policy development, and assurance 
(43).
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
 The  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  of  1996  included
provisions to protect the 
privacy  of  individually  identifiable  health  information.  To  implement  these  privacy
protections, the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services has issued a ruling on how health-care providers may use
and disclose personally identifiable 
health  information  about  their  patients;  these  regulations  provide  the  first  national
standards for requirements regarding 
the privacy of health information (217).
 HIPAA  also  recognizes  the  legitimate  need  for  public  health  authorities  and  others
responsible for ensuring 
the public's health and safety to have access to personal health information to conduct
their missions and the importance 
of public health disease reporting by health-care providers. HIPAA permits disclosure of
personal health information 
to public health authorities legally authorized to collect and receive the information for
specified public health 
purposes.  Such  information  may  be  disclosed  without  written  authorization  from  the
patient. Disclosures required by state 
and local public health or other laws are also permitted. Thus, HIPAA should not be a
barrier to the reporting of 
suspected  and  verified  TB  cases  by  health-care  providers,  including  health-care
institutions. Additional information about 
HIPAA is available at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa.
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Federal Public Health Agencies
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Jurisdictional Public Health Agencies
 Planning  and  policy  development.  The  blueprint  for  TB  control  for  a  given  area  is  a
responsibility of the 
jurisdictional public health agency. Policies and plans should be based on a thorough
understanding of local epidemiologic data 
and  on  the  capabilities  and  capacities  of  clinical  and  support  services  for  clients,  the
fiscal resources available for TB 
control, and ongoing indicators of program performance. Open collaboration is essential
among public health officials 
and  community  stakeholders,  experts  in  medical  and  nonmedical  TB  management,
laboratory directors, and 
professional organizations, all of whom provide practical perspectives to the content of
state and local TB-control policy. Policies 
and  procedures  should  reflect  national  and  local  standards  of  care  and  should  offer
guidance in the management of 
TB disease and LTBI.
 A written TB control plan that is updated regularly should be distributed widely to all
interested and involved 
parties. The plan should assign specific roles and responsibilities; 
define essential pathways of communication between providers, laboratories, and the
public health system; and assign sufficient resources, both human and financial, 
to ensure its implementation, including a responsible case manager for each suspected
and verified case of TB. The 
plan should include the provision of expert consultation and oversight for 
TB-related matters to clinicians, institutions, 
and communities. It should provide special guidance to local laboratories that process
TB-related samples, assist 
local authorities in conducting contact or outbreak investigations and DOT, and provide
culturally appropriate 
information to the community. Systems to minimize or eliminate financial and cultural
barriers to TB control should be integral 
to  the  plan,  and  persons  with  TB  and  persons  at  high  risk  with  TB  infection  should
receive culturally 
appropriate  education  about  TB  and  clinical  services,  including  treatment,  with  no
consideration for their ability to pay. Finally, 
the plan should be consistent with current legal statutes 
related to TB control. Relevant laws and regulations should 
be reviewed periodically and updated as necessary to 
ensure consistency with currently recommended clinical and 
public  health  practice  (e.g.,  mandatory  reporting  laws,  institutional  infection-control
procedures, hospital 
and correctional system discharge planning, and involuntary confinement laws) 
(218).
 Collection and analysis of epidemiologic and other data. 
The development of policies and plans for the control of 
TB  within  a  jurisdiction  requires  a  detailed  understanding  of  the  epidemiology  of  TB
within the jurisdiction. 
Mandatory  and  timely  case  reporting  from  community  sources  (e.g.,  providers,
laboratories, hospitals, and pharmacies) should 
be  enforced  and  evaluated  regularly.  To  facilitate  the  reporting  process  and  data
analyses, jurisdictions should 
modify systems as necessary to accommodate local needs and evolving technologies.
State and local TB-control programs 
should have the capability to monitor trends in TB disease and LTBI in populations at
high risk and to detect new patterns 
of  disease  and  possible  outbreaks.  Populations  at  high  risk  should  be  identified  and
targeted for active surveillance 
and prevention, including targeted testing and treatment of LTBI 
(4).
 Timely  and  accurate  reporting  of  suspected  and  confirmed  TB  cases  is  essential  for
public health planning 
and  assessment  at  all  levels.  Analyses  of  these  data  should  be  performed  at  least
annually to determine 
morbidity,  demographic  characteristics,  and  trends  so  that  opportunities  for  targeted
screening for disease or infection can 
be  identified.  Regular  reviews  of  clinical  data  (e.g.,  collaborative  formal  case
presentations and cohort analyses of 
treatment 
outcomes;  completeness,  timeliness  and  effectiveness  of  contact  investigations;  and
treatment of LTBI) may be used 
as indicators of program performance.
 Data should be collected and maintained in a secure, computerized data system that
contains up-to-date 
clinical  information  on  persons  with  suspected  and  confirmed  cases  and  on  other
persons at high risk. Each case should 
be reviewed at least once monthly by the case manager and by field or outreach staff
to identify problems that 
require  attention.  The  TB-case  registry  should  ensure  that  laboratory  data,  including
data on sputum culture conversion 
and drug susceptibility testing of clinical isolates, are promptly reported, if applicable,
to the health-care provider so 
any
 needed
 modifications
 in
 management
 can
 be
 made.
 This
 requires
 a
communications protocol for case 
managers,  providers,  and  the  public  health  and  private  laboratory  systems  that  will
transmit information in a timely 
fashion. Aggregate program data should be available to the health-care community and
to community groups and 
organizations with specific interests in public health to support education and advocacy
and to facilitate their 
collaboration in the planning process.
 Clinical and diagnostic services for patients with TB and their contacts. 
TB-control programs should ensure that patients with suspected or confirmed TB have
ready access to diagnostic and treatment services that meet 
national standards (3,5). These services are often provided by state- or city-supported
TB specialty clinics and staffed by 
health department personnel or by contracted service providers; however, persons may
seek medical care for TB infection 
or disease in the private medical sector. Regardless of where a person 
receives medical care, the primary responsibility 
for  ensuring  the  quality  and  completeness  of  all  TB-related  services  rests  with  the
jurisdictional health agency, and 
health departments should develop and maintain close working relations with 
local  laboratories,  pharmacies,  and  health-care  providers  to  ensure  that  standards  of
care, including those for reporting, are met.
 Clinical  services  provided  by  the  health  department,  contracted  vendors,  or  private
clinicians should be 
competent,  accessible,  and  acceptable  to  members  of  the  community  served  by  the
jurisdiction. Hours of clinic operation should 
be convenient, and waiting intervals between referral and 
appointments should be kept to a minimum. Persons 
with symptoms of TB should be accommodated immediately (i.e., on a walk-in basis).
Staff, including providers, 
should reflect the cultural and ethnic composition of the community to the extent that
this is possible, and competent 
clinical interpreter services should be available to those patients who do not speak 
English.  All  clinical  services,  including  diagnostic  evaluation,  medications,  clinical
monitoring, and transportation, should be available without consideration 
of  the  patient's  ability  to  pay  and  without  placing  undue  stress  on  the  patient  that
might impair completion of 
treatment.
 Clinical facilities should provide diagnostic, monitoring, and screening tests, including
radiology services. 
Health-care  providers,  including  nurses,  clinicians,  pharmacists,  laboratory  staff
members, and public health officials, should 
be educated about the use and interpretation of diagnostic tests for TB infection and
disease. Clinics and providers 
should monitor patients receiving TB medications at least monthly for drug toxicity and
for treatment response, 
according to prevailing standards of care 
(5). Counseling and voluntary testing for HIV infection should be offered to all persons 
with  suspected  and  proven  TB  and  to  certain  persons  with  LTBI,  with  referral  for  HIV
treatment services when necessary. 
A  case  manager,  usually  a  health  department  employee,  should  be  assigned  to  each
patient suspected or proven to have 
TB  to  ensure  that  adequate  education  is  provided  about  TB  and  its  management,
standard therapy is 
administered continuously, and identified contacts are evaluated for 
infection and disease.
 A treatment plan for persons with TB should be developed immediately on report of the
case. This plan should 
be reviewed periodically by the case manager and the treating clinician and modified as
necessary as new data 
become available (219). The treatment plan should include details about the medical
regimen used, how and where treatment 
is  to  be  administered,  monitoring  of  adherence,  drug  toxicity,  and  clinical  and
bacteriologic responses. Social 
and behavioral factors that might interfere with successful completion of 
treatment also should be addressed.
 Patient-specific  strategies  for  promoting  adherence  to  treatment  should  take  into
account each patient's clinical 
and social circumstances and needs (5). Such strategies might 
include the provision of incentives or enablers (e.g., 
monetary  payment,  public  transportation  passes,  food,  housing,  child  care,  or
transportation to the clinic for visits). Whether 
the patient's care is managed by a public health clinic or in the private sector, the initial
strategy used should 
emphasize direct observation of medication ingestion by an HCW. 
Patient input into this process (e.g., regarding medications to 
be  taken  or  the  location  of  DOT)  is  often  useful  as  it  can  minimize  the  burden  of
treatment and provide the patient 
a degree of control over an anticipated lengthy course of therapy.
 Expert medical consultation in TB should be available to the health-care community,
especially for patients who 
have drug-resistant disease or medical diagnoses that might affect the course or the
outcome of treatment. Consultants 
may be employees of the health department or clinicians with expertise who are under
contract with the health department.
 Inpatient  care  should  be  available  to  all  persons  with  suspected  or  proven  TB,
regardless of the person's ability to 
pay.  Hospitalized  patients  with  suspected  proven  TB  should  have  access  to  expert
medical and nursing care, 
essential  diagnostic  services,  medications,  and  clinical  monitoring  to  ensure  that
diagnostic and treatment standards are 
met.  Inpatient  facilities  that  manage  persons  who  are  at  risk  for  TB  should  have
infection-control policies and procedures 
in place to minimize the risk for nosocomial spread of infection. Facilities should report
persons with suspected 
or confirmed TB to the health department and arrange for discharge planning as 
required by statute.
 Public health agencies should have legal authority and 
adequate facilities to ensure that patients with infectious TB 
are isolated from the community until they are no longer 
infectious. This authority should include the ability 
to  enforce  legal  confinement  of  patients  who  are  unwilling  or  unable  to  adhere  to
medical advice 
(218,220). This authority also should apply to nonadherent patients who no longer are
infectious but who are at risk for 
becoming infectious again or becoming drug resistant.
 TB-control programs should serve as sources of information and expert consultation to
the health-care 
community regarding airborne infection and appropriate infection-control practice. A TB
program's presence raises overall 
provider  awareness  of  TB  and  facilitates  timely  diagnosis,  reporting,  and  treatment.
Collaboration with local health-care 
facilities to design and assist in periodic staff education and screening is often a health
department function. Expertise in 
airborne  infections  by  TB-control  personnel  may  be  shared  with  biologic  terrorism
programs to assist in the design 
and implementation of local protocols.
 Contact investigation, including education and evaluation of contacts of persons with
infectious TB, is a 
key  component  of  the  public  health  mandate  for  TB  control.  Often  the  primary
responsibility of the case manager, 
contact investigation should proceed as quickly and as thoroughly as indicated by the
characteristics of the specific case and 
by  those  of  the  exposed  contact  (e.g.,  young  children  or  immunocompromised
persons). This statement 
includes  recommendations  on  organizing  and  conducting  contact  investigations.
TB-control programs that are prepared 
to
 implement
 enhanced
 TB-control
 strategies
 should
 initiate
 or
 facilitate
implementation by other medical providers 
of  programs  for  targeted  testing  and  treatment  of  persons  with  LTBI  on  the  basis  of
local epidemiologic data that 
identify populations at high risk. A public health approach to this activity is presented in
this statement (see 
Essential Components of TB Control in the United States).
 Liaison  with  communities  at  high  risk  is  critical  to  the  success  of  TB  control  in  any
jurisdiction. TB-control 
programs should develop strong lines of communication with local community groups
and organizations and their 
health-care  providers  to  understand  local  priorities  and  beliefs  about  TB.  Trusted
community members can facilitate the design 
and  implementation  of  strategies  to  improve  TB  diagnosis  and  prevention.
Community-based clinical services that use 
local  providers  who  are  educated  in  TB  treatment  and  prevention  and  who  have  a
connection with the TB-control 
program can improve community acceptance of prevention and treatment of TB 
(221).
 Training and education. TB-control programs should provide education and training in
the clinical and public 
health aspects of TB to all program staff. Staff members should 
receive appropriate education at regular intervals on the basis 
of their particular responsibilities in the program and should demonstrate proficiency in
those areas when tested. 
Public health TB programs also should educate health-care providers (both public and
private), community members, 
public health officials, and policy makers on the basis of local epidemiology and needs.
To ensure the availability of a 
competent workforce for TB that understands and meets the needs of its community,
state TB programs should use resources 
from CDC-funded national TB centers, NIH-supported TB curriculum centers, NTCA, and
other national and local 
agencies to create and implement education activities in coordination with schools of
medicine, nursing, pharmacy, dentistry, 
and  public  health;  community-based  organizations  and  their  constituents;  local
health-care providers; and 
health-care institutions (222). A Strategic Plan for Public Health Work 
Force Development (223) and a Strategic Plan 
for Tuberculosis Training and Education have been developed.
 Information  management.  Information-management  systems  are  key  factors  in
medical safety and 
quality  improvement  (224,225)  and  should  be  prioritized  by  all  TB-control  programs.
Information technology can improve 
care of patients with TB through standardized collection of data; tracking of test results
and details of 
treatment, 
including administration of DOT; and prediction of 
interactions among medications. Information technology can 
also  facilitate  analysis  and  rapid  distribution  of  epidemiologic  data  and  the
management of individualized treatment 
plans  (5)  and  support  ongoing  program  performance  analyses.  Barriers  to  successful
implementation of information 
technology include costs and resistance to change.
 Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  systematic  monitoring  and  analysis  of  program
activities 
is a critical factor in enhancing program performance. Evaluation techniques provide TB
programs with an evidence-based approach to 
assess and improve their TB-control strategies by understanding what causes good or
bad program performance. 
Evaluation can also be used for program advocacy, assessing staffing needs, training
and capacity building, directing 
limited resources to the most productive activities, accounting for available resources,
generating additional resources, 
and recognizing achievement (226).
 Each public health agency should develop its own priorities for program evaluation on
the basis of the nature 
and  dimensions  of  the  TB  problem  in  its  jurisdiction  and  the  way  that  services  are
organized. In general, the first priority 
for evaluation efforts should be to focus on those activities and outcomes that relate
most directly to the key strategies of 
TB control: detecting patients with infectious TB and administering a complete course
of treatment; finding contacts 
and  other  persons  at  high  risk  with  LTBI  and  treating  them;  and  interrupting
transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in high-risk settings (Box 4).
 Targets for program performance have been established by CDC 
(227) to assist public health agencies in treating 
TB patients, protecting their contacts, and improving the quality of case reporting for
national surveillance 
(Table 4). These national objectives for program performance provide a starting point
for state and local TB-control programs to use 
for program evaluation, but each TB-control program should 
establish methods to evaluate its performance.
 TB case management has typically been evaluated by 
reviewing individual charts and case conferences. 
However, cohort analysis, a systematic evaluation of the treatment outcomes of all TB
cases during a stipulated period of time, 
is  the  preferred  means  of  determining  the  number  and  percentage  of  cases  that
complete a course of treatment in 
<12 months. Cohort analyses should be a cornerstone of evaluation by all TB-control
programs. A guide to cohort 
analysis and other evaluation tools has been published 
(228). National objectives have been set for completing treatment 
for LTBI among contacts of infectious cases of TB (Table 4). Other program areas that
should be monitored through 
formal  evaluation  methods  include  timeliness  and  completeness  of  reporting  of  TB
cases and suspected cases, frequency of use 
of a recommended treatment regimen for patients with TB and LTBI, and quality of the
program's databases 
for surveillance and case management.
 To respond to the need for improved and standardized program evaluation activities,
CDC and six state 
TB-control  programs  have  established  an  Evaluation  Working  Group  whose  goal  is  to
improve the capacity of TB-control 
programs  to  routinely  conduct  self-evaluations  and  use  the  findings  to  improve  and
enhance their programs. The group 
is developing indicators for program performance and an inventory of evaluation tools,
including data 
collection instruments, data analysis methods, and evaluation training materials. During
the next 2 years, a draft set of 
these  materials  will  be  tested  in  three  TB-control  programs  for  utility,  feasibility,  and
accuracy. Ultimately, this package 
of evaluation materials and resources will be made available to all TB-control programs.
 
Public Health Workforce
 No single model exists for staffing public health TB-control programs. Approaches to TB
control should be 
flexible and adaptable to local needs and circumstances. Two components of the public
health workforce, public health 
nurses and community outreach workers, merit specific 
attention.
 Public  health  nurses.  Public  health  nurses  are  registered  nurses  with  a  Bachelor  of
Science degree who are employed 
or  whose  services  are  contracted  for  by  health  departments.  Certain  states  require
certification for additional 
competencies  before  being  hired  as  a  public  health  nurse.  Public  health  nurses
traditionally have played a prominent role in 
TB control in the United States. Their training, including that in nonmedical aspects of
disease, has provided nurses 
with  the  special  skills  needed  to  manage  or  coordinate  the  medical  and  the
social-behavioral concerns associated with 
the prevention and treatment of TB (229). Their training includes 1) designing contact
and source-case investigations; 
2)  educating  patients,  contacts,  and  families;  3)  identifying  ineffective  drug  therapy
regimens and drug toxicities; 
4) recognizing patient behaviors that might lead to poor adherence; and 5) developing
strategies to encourage 
completion  of  therapy.  As  health  departments  adapt  to  changing  health-care
environments, the role of public health nurses 
working 
to  control  TB  also  is  evolving  to  accommodate  the  varied  mechanisms  by  which
services are delivered. Standards 
of  practice  for  TB  nursing  are  being  updated  by  the  National  Tuberculosis  Nurse
Consultant 
Coalition,  a  section  of  NTCA,  to  guide  jurisdictions  in  creating  and  maintaining  a
specialized nursing resource for TB 
control and prevention.
 Community  outreach  workers.  Community  outreach  workers  are  staff  members  who
provide services, such as 
DOT,  to  patients  outside  of  the  clinic.  They  may  also  be  classified  as  disease
investigation specialists or community 
health  educators.  Because  TB  has  become  concentrated  in  specific  populations  (e.g.,
foreign-born and homeless persons) in 
the  United  States,  outreach  workers  have  assumed  a  key  role  in  TB  control.  Often
members of the communities they 
serve, outreach workers connect the health-care system with populations at high risk,
ensuring that the principles 
and processes of TB control are communicated to and understood by those populations.
Outreach workers' functions 
include  facilitating  treatment  for  patients  and  contacts;  providing  DOT;  educating
patients, their families, workplace 
personnel, and communities; and participating in contact investigations. In each case,
outreach workers form a bridge 
between  patients  and  health-care  providers  to  achieve  common  understandings  and
acceptance of plans for diagnoses 
and  treatment.  Clinicians  with  specialized  expertise,  including  nurse-case  managers,
should supervise outreach workers.
Clinicians
 Clinicians  in  medical  practice  in  the  nonpublic  health  sector  play  a  vital  role  in  TB
control throughout the 
United States. Hospital- or clinic-based medical practitioners, 
including those working in emergency departments (EDs), 
are usually the first source of medical care for persons with TB 
(230--232); they also may provide ongoing management 
for TB patients (48). The role of medical practitioners in TB control will 
increase  as  TB  morbidity  in  the  United  States  decreases  and  jurisdictions  reduce  or
even eliminate public health clinical services for TB.
 Medical practitioners are often not sufficiently knowledgeable about TB 
(233), and clinicians in private 
practice  frequently  do  not  follow  recommended  guidelines  and  make  errors  in
prescribing anti-TB therapy 
(231,234,235).  The  failure  of  public  health  and  private  practitioners  to  interact
effectively is a weak link in global TB control 
(236).  Successful  models  exist  for  acknowledging  and  facilitating  the  work  of  private
medical practitioners in the 
complex  process  of  diagnosing  and  treating  persons  with  TB.  For  example,  for  each
reported TB case in New Mexico, 
a collaborative case-management strategy is used that includes treating clinicians and
pharmacists from the private 
sector in addition to public health case managers 
(48). Another model of effective private-public partnerships was employed 
in  NYC  during  the  1985--1992  TB  resurgence,  with  health  department  case
management and DOT for patients 
under private care (13).
 As TB elimination efforts continue, the role of medical practitioners will further expand
because they provide access 
to  populations  that  have  been  targeted  for  testing  and  treatment  of  LTBI.  Greater
participation by the nonpublic 
health sector in preventive intervention has been advocated 
(2,51), and clinical standards have been published to guide 
medical practitioners in managing patients with TB disease and LTBI 
(8).
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Clinicians
 Civil  surgeons  are  licensed  physicians  who  are  certified  by  the  U.S.  Citizenship  and
Immigration Service (CIS) 
to  conduct  a  required  health  screening  examination,  including  testing  for  LTBI  and
active TB disease, on 
foreign-born persons living in the United States who apply for permanent residency. In
2002, approximately 679,000 
foreign-born  persons  applied  for  permanent  residency  and  were  screened  by  civil
surgeons, compared with 245,000 such persons 
in  1995  (238).  CDC  has  responsibility  for  providing  guidance  on  screening  and
treatment but has no regulatory role 
in monitoring the quality or outcomes of these examinations.
 Because of their access to foreign-born persons at high risk, civil surgeons are a critical
component of TB 
control.  U.S.-based  immigration  screening  can  identify  foreign-born  persons  with  LTBI
for whom treatment is indicated 
(239). Although civil surgeons receive immigration-focused training, little information is
available on the knowledge, 
attitudes,  and  practices  of  civil  surgeons.  A  recent  survey  indicated  that  among  491
physicians serving as civil surgeons 
in California, Massachusetts, and New York, the majority were graduates of U.S. medical
schools; 75% were primary 
care  practitioners;  and  47%  were  board  certified  in  their  specialty.  Among  5,739
foreign-born applicants examined by 
these civil surgeons, 1,449 (25%) received nonstandard screening 
(240). As a result of these findings, efforts are under way 
to  develop  guidance  documents  and  training  materials  for  physicians  who  screen
immigrants for TB infection and disease.
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Civil Surgeons
 Community  health  centers  typically  provide  primary  health-care  services  to
populations that encounter barriers 
to receiving those services at other sites in the health-care system, such as low-income
working persons and their 
families,  immigrants  and  refugees,  uninsured  persons,  homeless  persons,  the  frail
elderly, and poor women and children. 
Patients  at  high  risk  for  TB  often  receive  primary  and  emergency  health  care  in
community health centers 
(51).  For  example,  community  health  centers  in  certain  inner-city  areas  might  serve
primarily a clientele of homeless persons, 
whereas  centers  in  neighborhoods  in  which  certain  racial  and  ethnic  populations  are
concentrated might become 
predominant health-care providers for immigrants and refugees. Newly arriving refugee
families are frequently directed to 
community  health  centers  to  receive  federally  supported  health-screening  services,
which might include targeted testing 
and treatment for LTBI. Persons with symptoms of TB might go first for evaluation and
care to a community health 
center. For these reasons, community health centers are a critical part of 
efforts to control and prevent TB.
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Community Health Centers
 Hospitals provide multiple services that are instrumental to the diagnosis, treatment,
and control of TB. 
Hospitals  with  active  outpatient  and  EDs  often  serve  as  sites  of  acute  and  primary
medical care for homeless persons, 
inner-city  residents,  immigrants  and  refugees,  and  other  persons  at  high  risk  for  TB.
Also, hospital staff members often 
provide  medical  consultation  services  for  the  diagnosis  and  management  of  TB  by
public health and community 
clinicians. Laboratory services provided by hospitals for community-based medical care
providers might include key diagnostic 
tests for TB.
 TB cases often are detected during hospitalization at acute-care hospitals 
(230,242). In a prospective cohort study at 
10  sites  in  the  United  States,  678  (45%)  of  1,493  patients  reported  with  TB  received
their diagnosis 
during hospitalization (230). Hospital-based health professionals evaluate 
patients for TB, establish the diagnosis, and 
initiate  treatment  regimens  and  reporting  of  cases  to  public  health  departments.
Instances of delayed recognition, diagnosis, 
and treatment for TB among hospitalized patients subsequently found to have TB have
been reported 
(24,178), indicating a need for more effective training and education of hospital medical
staff 
members.
 Because 25%--45% of patients with TB receive their diagnostic evaluation while in a
hospital 
(230,242),  hospitals  have  an  opportunity  to  provide  patient-based  teaching  on  TB  for
their own staff members and for health 
professionals  from  the  community  served  by  the  hospital.  Venues  such  as  staff
conferences and medical grand rounds, 
conducted regularly by hospitals, can be sources of training and education on clinical,
laboratory, and public health concerns 
that  arise  during  evaluation  and  initial  medical  management  of  hospitalized  patients
with TB.
 Hospitals should protect their patients, staff, and visitors from exposure to 
M. tuberculosis. The importance of 
effective TB infection control was emphasized during the 1985--1992 TB resurgence in
the United States, when hospitals 
were identified as sites of transmission of multidrug-resistant TB 
(243). Implementation of effective 
infection-control  guidelines  has  been  effective  in  reducing  transmission  of  TB  in
hospitals 
(56,244,245).
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Hospitals
 Academic institutions (including schools of medicine, public health, and nursing) have
an opportunity to 
contribute  to  TB  control  in  the  United  States  and  worldwide.  Students  from  diverse
disciplines, including the clinical 
and  laboratory  sciences,  nursing,  epidemiology,  and  health  services  should  be
introduced to applicable concepts 
of public health in general and, because TB is a major cause of preventable illness and
death in developing countries 
(44),  to  TB  in  particular.  During  the  resurgence  of  TB  in  the  United  States  during
1985--1992, expertise in TB was 
limited. Federal funding for programs (e.g., the NIH 
National Heart Lung Blood Institute's Tuberculosis Academic 
Award program) helped provide funding to incorporate teaching of TB more fully into
medical school curricula. Researchers 
at academic institutions are critical to efforts to improve the prevention, management,
and control of TB because of 
their  efforts  to  develop  new  tools,  including  new  diagnostic  tests,  new  drugs,  better
means of identifying and treating 
LTBI, and basic research to create a vaccine for TB 
(180,246,247).
 As with hospitals, academic institutions can provide benefits to other participants in TB
control. Conferences, 
grand rounds, and other presentations are a source of continuing education for private
medical practitioners and 
other community-based HCWs. As well-trained specialists, 
researchers at academic institutions can provide 
clinical,  radiographic,  and  epidemiologic  consultation  to  medical  practitioners  and
public health agencies. A majority 
of  academic  institutions  manage  university-based  hospitals,  which  often  serve
populations at high risk. University 
hospitals can become models for TB risk assessment of patients, 
inpatient care, and infection-control practice, and they can 
serve as tertiary care sites for an entire community or 
region.
 Partnerships  between  academic  institutions  and  public  health  agencies  are  mutually
beneficial 
(248). In certain cases, health departments and public health TB clinics are staffed or
managed by faculty physicians from 
academic  institutions.  This  partnership  facilitates  use  of  these  clinics  for  graduate
medical training for physicians in 
subspecialty  areas  (e.g.,  pulmonary  and  infectious  diseases),  enhances  training  for
clinic staff, and provides opportunities 
for clinical and operational research.
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Academic Institutions
 Because they are involved with medical practice, research, education, advocacy, and
public health, medical 
professional  organizations  are  critical  partners  in  TB  control  efforts.  Greater
participation of the nonpublic health medical sector 
is needed to maintain clinical expertise in the diagnosis and management of TB in an
era of declining 
incidence.
 Organizations
 whose
 memberships
 include
 primary
 care
 medical
practitioners can make significant contributions to 
the control, prevention, and elimination of TB by including 
TB in their training and education agendas.
 ATS and IDSA both support TB control efforts in the United States. With a membership
of approximately 
14,000  health  professionals,  including  clinicians  trained  in  pulmonary  diseases,  ATS
conducts research, education, patient 
care,  and  advocacy  to  prevent  respiratory  diseases  worldwide.  IDSA  promotes  and
recognizes excellence in patient 
care, education, research, public health, and the prevention of infectious 
diseases.  In  recent  years,  IDSA  has  joined  ATS  in  focusing  education  and  advocacy
activities on TB through its annual meetings, publications, and sponsorship of 
this series of statements.
 Other medical professional organizations also can support TB control efforts. Medical
professional organizations can 
1)  provide  TB  education  to  their  members  through  meetings,  symposia,  statements,
and web sites; 2) serve as venues 
for  better  communication  between  the  private  medical  and  public  health  sectors;  3)
promote the TB research agenda 
locally and nationally; and 4) advocate for resources for strong TB control globally and
in the United States.
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Medical Professional Organizations
 Involvement of community groups in TB control has long been encouraged 
(17). The critical importance of such involvement 
is  underscored  by  the  trend  in  the  United  States  for  TB  to  be  limited  to  certain
populations at high 
risk (e.g., contacts of persons with active cases, persons born outside the United States,
homeless persons, 
incarcerated  persons,  and  persons  with  HIV  infection).  Programs  for  education  and
targeted testing and treatment of LTBI should 
be organized for these populations.
 The public health sector frequently experiences difficulty in gaining access to persons
in populations of high risk 
(51). Such persons might be socially marginalized, as in the case of new refugees, or
they might be suspicious of 
persons  representing  government  agencies,  as  in  the  case  of  undocumented  aliens.
Furthermore, the target population's own 
view of its health-care priorities, often best articulated by 
community-based organizations that represent them, should 
be considered in the design of public health interventions 
(249). Social, political, religious, and 
health-related  organizations  that  have  arisen  from  grassroots  efforts  to  meet
community needs often can facilitate access to public 
health programs (221).
 Community-based organizations can be particularly 
effective in providing information and education on TB to 
their  constituencies.  As  part  of  the  communities  they  serve,  such  organizations  are
often highly regarded in 
their communities, and their messages might be accepted more positively than those
delivered by the jurisdictional 
health department.
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Community-Based Organizations
 Correctional facilities are common sites of TB transmission and propagation 
(250,251). Incidence of TB and of LTBI are substantially higher in prisons and jails than
in the general population 
(252,253). TB is believed to be the leading cause of death for prisoners worldwide 
(254).
 Targeted  testing  for  and  treatment  of  LTBI  in  correctional  facilities  have  been
demonstrated to have a 
substantial  public  health  impact  (124).  Testing  and  treatment  for  LTBI  is  carried  out
more easily in prisons 
(255) because the length of stay is generally sufficient to permit completion of a course
of treatment. Jails have proved convenient sites 
for targeted testing, but subsequent treatment of LTBI has proved challenging 
(256).  Innovative  methods  for  assuring  completion  of  treatment  for  LTBI  in  jail
detainees have been 
proposed (257).
 Because of their communal living arrangements, correctional facilities, like health-care
facilities, have the 
responsibility to limit the transmission of TB within the institution and to protect their
inhabitants and staff from exposure. This is 
a particular challenge in jails because of the short lengths of stay for the majority of
detainees. Even in prison 
systems, abrupt and unexpected transfers of detainees among institutions might occur,
with little consideration for health 
issues. Prisons and jails frequently house HIV-infected persons in separate facilities to
ensure adequate health care. 
However,  recent  publications  describing  outbreaks  of  TB  in  such  settings  have
emphasized the hazard of this strategy 
(35,126).
 
Roles and Responsibilities of Correctional Facilities
 Because of their essential role in developing new diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines, the
pharmaceutical 
and biotechnology industries are partners in TB control. 
Although development of new tools for diagnosis, treatment, 
and prevention of TB has been deemed essential to the effort to combat the disease
globally and to continue to make 
progress toward its elimination in the United States and other developed countries 
(1,2,45,259), progress in these fields has 
been  slow.  Slow  progress  in  this  field  has  been  attributed  to  private  industry's
perception that such products are not needed 
in developed countries and do not offer profit opportunities 
in resource-poor countries (246,260). However, new 
public-private partnerships are emerging to facilitate 
the development of essential new tools (261), 
including three partnerships established with support 
from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation: the Global Alliance for Tuberculosis 
Drug  Development  (http://www.tballiance.org),  the  Aeras  Global  Tuberculosis  Vaccine
Foundation (http://www.aeras.org), 
and the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics 
(http://www.finddiagnostics.org). These organizations have 
provided  venues  to  identify  and  address  obstacles  to  developing  new  tools  for  TB
among private industry, public and 
academic  researchers,  and  philanthropic  organizations.  These  organizations  also
receive support from the private sector.
 The  pharmaceutical  industry  has  also  contributed  to  the  global  TB  control  effort  by
assisting in making drugs for 
TB,  including  second-line  drugs  for  patients  with  multidrug-resistant  TB,  more
affordable 
(262,263).  Such  actions  can  enable  pharmaceutical  companies  to  become  leaders  in
efforts to improve TB control and prevention.
 
Roles and Responsibilities of the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industries
 Case detection and case management include the range of activities that begin when a
diagnosis of TB is first 
suspected and end with the completion of a course of treatment for the illness. TB case
management describes the 
activities  undertaken  by  the  jurisdictional  public  health  agency  and  its  partners  to
ensure successful completion of TB 
treatment  and  cure  of  the  patient.  The  rationale  and  methodology  of  TB  case
management have been described previously 
(5). Organizational aspects of case management from the viewpoint of the jurisdictional
public health agency are 
also discussed in this statement.
 Case detection includes the processes that lead to the presentation, evaluation, receipt
of diagnosis, and reporting 
of  persons  with  active  TB.  Case  detection  involves  patients  with  active  TB  who  seek
medical care for symptoms 
associated  with  TB,  their  access  to  health  care,  their  health-care  providers,  the
consultants and clinical laboratories used by 
those  health-care  providers,  and  the  responsible  public  health  agency.  Although
steadily increasing treatment completion 
rates (14) indicate that progress has been made in the management of TB 
patients,  TB  case  detection  is  still  problematic.  Delays  in  diagnosis  and  report  of  TB
cases continue to be common. Also, despite the 44% reduction in TB incidence 
in  the  United  States  since  1992,  the  proportion  of  pulmonary  cases  that  are  sputum
smear-positive at diagnosis 
has changed little, accounting for >60% of all reported cases 
(14). The majority of pulmonary TB cases continue to 
be  diagnosed  at  an  advanced  stage.  Earlier  diagnosis  would  result  in  less  individual
morbidity and death, greater success 
in 
treatment,  less  transmission  to  contacts,  and  fewer  outbreaks  of  TB.  Improvement  in
the detection of TB cases 
is essential to progress toward elimination of TB in the United States (Box 1).
 The first step in improving TB case detection is to remove barriers in access to medical
services that are 
often  encountered  by  persons  in  high-risk  categories.  Such  barriers  might  be
patient-related, such as cultural 
stigmas associated with the diagnosis of TB, which might lead foreign-born persons to
deny or hide symptoms 
(264,265),  or  fear  of  being  reported  to  immigration  authorities  if  medical  care  is
accessed 
(19).  Foreign-born  persons,  particularly  recently  arrived  immigrants,  refugees,  and
other persons of low SES might not have access to primary health 
services because they do not have health insurance or they are not familiar with the
U.S. medical care system 
(20,118,266).
 Removing  patient-related  barriers  to  health  care  is  particularly  difficult.  Improved
patient education about TB 
is  needed  (18).  Continuing  immigration  from  countries  at  high  risk,  often  including
persons with strong cultural 
views about TB, underscores the need for patient education. As with other 
interventions to enhance TB control and prevention, local public health action should be
based on the local pattern of disease. In developing education 
messages  and  outreach  strategies,  public  health  authorities  should  work  with
organizations that serve communities at high risk 
to gain community input (203). This statement provides recommendations on working
with 
community-based  organizations,  key  informants,  and  academic  institutions  to  gain
ethnographic information, learn about the health 
beliefs  and  values  of  populations  at  high  risk  within  the  community,  and  develop
targeted interventions that will be 
most effective.
 The majority of TB cases are detected during the medical evaluation of symptomatic
illnesses 
(19,267).  Persons  experiencing  symptoms  ultimately  attributable  to  TB  usually  seek
care not at a public health TB clinic but rather 
from other medical practitioners and health-care settings. In 18 
California counties with the highest TB morbidity of 
persons  during  1996--1997,  initial  points  of  entry  into  the  health-care  system  for
persons who received a diagnosis of TB 
were  hospital  inpatient  evaluations  (45%),  private  outpatient  offices  or  clinic
evaluations (32%), TB clinic evaluations 
(12%),  and  other  sites  (11%),  including  a  non-TB  clinic  in  a  health  department  and
correctional facilities 
(California  Tuberculosis  Controllers  Association,  unpublished  data,  2003).  A  similar
pattern was observed in Washington state. 
In Seattle and its suburban areas in 1997, primary care practitioners or clinics reported
48% of TB cases during 
evaluations  of  outpatients  with  symptoms  and  32%  during  hospital  evaluations;  only
2% of cases were diagnosed during a 
public  health  TB  clinic  evaluation  for  a  symptomatic  illness  (Seattle-King  County
Department of Public Health, 
unpublished data, 1998).
 These data indicate that the professionals in the primary health-care sector, including
hospital and ED 
clinicians,  should  be trained  to  recognize patients with  symptoms consistent with  TB.
Dramatic reductions in TB were recorded 
in NYC (13) and Baltimore (195) in association with extensive education campaigns for
health-care providers in 
the community. These studies indicate the need to maintain clinical expertise for the
diagnosis and treatment of TB 
(24,41).
 Because  pulmonary  disease  among  adults  is  most  frequently  associated  with  the
spread of TB, the following 
discussion  and  recommendations  regarding  TB  case  detection  are  limited  to
considerations of pulmonary TB among adults. 
A classic set of historic features, signs, symptoms, and radiographic findings occurring
among adults should raise 
a suspicion of pulmonary TB and prompt a diagnostic investigation 
(3,189,267--271). Historic features include 
exposure to TB, a positive test result for 
M. tuberculosis infection, and the presence 
of risk factors such as immigration from a high-prevalence 
area, HIV infection, homelessness, or previous 
incarceration. Signs and symptoms typical of TB 
include  prolonged  coughing  with  production  of  sputum  that  might  be  bloody,  fever,
night sweats, and weight loss. On a 
chest radiograph, the classical findings of TB in immunocompetent 
patients are upper-lobe infiltrates, frequently 
with evidence of contraction fibrosis and cavitation 
(270). However, these features are not specific for TB, and, for 
every person in whom pulmonary TB is diagnosed, an estimated 10--100 persons are
suspected on the basis of clinical 
criteria and must be evaluated (272,273).
 The clinical presentation of TB varies considerably as a 
result of the extent of disease and the host response. 
In addition, variation in clinical symptoms and signs of TB is associated with underlying
illnesses (e.g., HIV 
infection,  chronic  renal  failure,  alcoholism,  drug  abuse,  and  diabetes  mellitus).  The
signs of TB are also associated with race 
and ethnicity and are attributed to unknown factors 
(3,267,270). The chest radiograph among persons with advanced 
HIV  infection  and  pulmonary  TB,  for  example,  might  have  lower-lobe  and  lobar
infiltrates, hilar adenopathy, or 
interstitial 
infiltrates (274). TB should be suspected in any patient who has persistent cough for 
>2--3 weeks or other compatible signs and 
symptoms as noted previously (10,267,275).
 In the drive toward TB elimination in the United States, effective TB case detection is
essential, and 
medical practitioners should recognize patients in their practice who are at increased
risk for TB and be aware of the 
possibility  of  diagnosing  TB  if  they  observe  compatible  symptoms.  Guidelines  have
been provided for the initial steps of TB 
case  detection  in  five  clinical  scenarios  encountered  by  providers  of  primary  health
care, including those serving in 
medical EDs (Table 5). In these settings, evidence exists to support proceeding with a
diagnostic evaluation for pulmonary 
TB. The subsequent management of suspected cases in these scenarios depends on the
judgment of the medical 
practitioner, in consultation with specialists in internal medicine, pulmonary diseases,
or infectious diseases if necessary 
(5).  These  recommendations  do  not  cover  the  spectrum  of  clinical  presentations  of
pulmonary TB in adults 
and are not meant to substitute for sound clinical judgment.
 Cases  of  pulmonary  TB  also  are  detected  through  directed  public  health  activities
designed to detect TB disease 
among  certain  persons  who  have  not  sought  medical  care.  Compared  with  persons
whose cases were detected passively 
by medical practitioners among patients who have sought medical care, persons whose
cases are detected actively are 
usually in a less advanced stage of pulmonary disease, as manifested by the absence of
symptoms and by negative sputum 
AFB smear results. Although no supporting literature exists, cases detected 
in that stage of disease might be less advanced 
and easier to cure.
 Active efforts to detect cases of TB among persons who have not sought medical care
are routinely made 
during evaluation of contacts of patients with pulmonary TB 
(30,31,276) and of other persons with newly diagnosed 
infection with M. tuberculosis 
(4). Screening for TB also is performed during evaluation of immigrants and refugees
with Class 
B1 or Class B2 TB notification status 
(277--279), during evaluations of persons involved in TB 
outbreaks (34,35,136,172,280,281), and occasionally in working with populations with a
known high incidence of 
TB  (167,185).  Screening  for  TB  disease  is  indicated  when  the  risk  for  TB  in  the
population is high and when 
the consequences of an undiagnosed case of TB are severe 
(282), such as in jails and prisons 
(253,283).
 Screening  for  TB  disease  (i.e.,  active  case  finding)  might  contribute  substantially  to
overall TB case detection. 
A  population-based  study  from  Los  Angeles  indicated  that  30%  of  reported  TB  cases
during the period of study 
were detected through screening activities 
(267). During 1998--2001, of 356 TB cases reported by the Seattle-King 
County TB Program, 40 (11%) were detected through active case detection in contact
investigation and evaluations 
of immigrants and refugees with Class B1 and B2 TB notification status.
 The clinical settings in which TB has been effectively 
detected among persons without symptoms, the methodology 
of testing, and outcomes of the screening process have been described 
(Table 6). On the basis of its very high yield of detecting TB cases, domestic follow-up
evaluation of immigrants and refugees with Class B1 and B2 TB 
notification status should be given highest priority by all TB-control programs. The yield
of detecting TB cases during screening 
at  homeless  shelters  increased  sharply  in  an  outbreak  setting  (Table  6).  Although
prevalence data from individual 
studies  are  not  available,  investigations  undertaken  to  control  TB  outbreaks  that
involved diverse 
settings and groups of immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons have 
consistently been productive in detecting TB cases and 
high rates of LTBI among exposed persons 
(34,35,136,173,280,281). Outbreak investigations 
should  be  counted  among  the  settings  in  which  screening  for  active  TB  is
recommended.
Contact Investigation and Outbreak Control
 Contact investigation is an essential function of TB control in the United States (Box 4) 
(1,17). The investigation of a case of TB results in identifying approximately 10 contacts
(284). Among close contacts, approximately 30% have 
LTBI, and 1%--3% have progressed to TB disease 
(30,284). Without intervention, approximately 5% of contacts with 
newly acquired LTBI progress to TB disease within 2 years of the exposure 
(285). The prevalence of TB among close contacts 
is  approximately  1,000/100,000  population  (>100-fold  higher  than  in  the  general
population) 
(285). Examination of contacts is therefore one of the most 
important activities for identifying persons with disease and 
those with LTBI who have a high risk for acquiring TB disease.
 Transmission of M. tuberculosis has occurred in health-care facilities 
(286,287), bars (134,288), doctors' offices 
(289), airplanes (290), crack houses 
(291), respite facilities that provide care for HIV-infected persons 
(136), drug 
rehabilitation methadone centers (36), navy ships 
(292), homeless shelters (120), schools 
(173), church choirs (140), and renal transplant units 
(141). The utility and importance of contact 
investigations in those settings and also for populations at high risk (e.g., foreign-born
persons 
[293], children [294--297], and persons exposed to 
multidrug-resistant TB cases [91,298]) has also been documented.
 In  the  United  States,  state  and  local  public  health  agencies  perform  90%  of  contact
investigations as part of the 
public health mandate for TB control (Box 5) 
(2). Public health TB-control programs are responsible for ensuring that 
contact  investigations  are  conducted  effectively  and  that  all  exposed  contacts  are
identified, provided with 
access to adequate care, and followed to completion of therapy. For health agencies to
fully discharge this 
responsibility, adequate funding and political commitment are required.
 Health agencies use a general epidemiologic framework for contact investigations 
(299).  However,  this  approach  alone  might  have  limited  effectiveness  because  of
factors such as initial diagnostic delays and failure to ensure completion 
of therapy for LTBI. Consequently, programs have recognized the necessity of widening
traditional contact 
investigation  sites  to  include  nonhousehold  locations  (e.g.,  homeless  shelters,
correctional facilities, nursing homes, and hospices 
that serve HIV-infected persons) and households. Genotyping studies have documented
that traditional contact 
investigation methods have failed to identify contacts or detect transmission of 
M. tuberculosis 
(28,33,34,151,172). As a result, IOM 
(2) and ACET (1) have called for the development and implementation of 
enhanced techniques for contact investigation.
 The primary goal of a contact investigation is to identify persons who were exposed to
infectious 
M. tuberculosis and ensure that they are tested for 
M. tuberculosis infection, screened for TB disease, are followed up, and complete a 
standard course of treatment, if indicated. Secondary goals are to stop transmission of 
M. tuberculosis by identifying 
undetected  patients  with  infectious  TB  and  to  determine  whether  a  TB  outbreak  has
occurred. In that case, 
an expanded outbreak investigation should ensue.
 
Steps of a Contact Investigation
 State and local public health agencies, often represented by TB-control programs, are
responsible for initiating 
and  conducting  contact  investigations  and  evaluating  their  outcomes  to  ensure  their
effectiveness. A contact investigation 
has 14 steps, as follows:
 
Outbreak Investigations
 Failure to recognize an increase in the occurrence of TB 
(162) or to expand a contact investigation when needed 
can result in continued transmission of TB. Missed epidemiologic links among patients
with TB can have 
severe consequences as evidenced in an outbreak associated with a floating card game
in the rural south 
(172) and an outbreak in Kansas among exotic dancers and their close contacts that
occurred during a 7-year period 
(38).
 When TB occurs with high incidence, clusters of cases that have epidemiologic links
likely occur constantly but 
tend to blend into the generally high morbidity 
(306). In a low-incidence setting, however, clusters of linked TB cases can 
be identified more readily. Three criteria have been 
established to determine that a TB outbreak is occurring 
(162):  1)  an  increase  has  occurred  above  the  expected  number  of  TB  cases;  2)
transmission is continuing despite 
adequate control efforts by the TB-control program; and 3) contact investigations 
associated with the increased cases require 
additional outside help.
 TB outbreaks have occurred in low-incidence areas in which expertise and experience
in dealing with such 
outbreaks might be lacking. Such outbreaks have occurred among different populations
and settings, including a young 
foreign-born child in North Dakota (25); exotic dancers and their contacts in Kansas 
(38), homeless persons in Syracuse, New York 
(120);  factory  workers  in  Maine  (188);  and  limited,  seemingly  unrelated  clusters  of
cases that were the cause 
over time of perpetuating transmission in Alabama 
(307).
 For an increase in the expected number of TB cases (the first criterion of an outbreak)
to be identified, the 
local epidemiology of TB should be understood. Detection of a TB outbreak in an area in
which prevalence is low 
might  depend  on  a  combination  of  factors,  including  recognition  of  sentinel  events,
routine genotype cluster analysis 
of surveillance data, and analysis of 
M. tuberculosis drug-resistance and genotyping patterns.
 When  an  outbreak  is  identified,  short-term  investigation  activities  should  follow  the
same principles as those for 
the epidemiologic part of the contact investigation (i.e., defining the infectious period,
settings, risk groups, mode 
of  transmission,  contact  identification,  and  follow-up).  However,  long-term  activities
require continued active 
surveillance, M. tuberculosis genotyping, additional contact investigations and related
follow-up for additional cases, and 
continuing  education  of  providers,  staff,  and  patients.  Consequently,  a  plan  for
long-term support should exist from the outset 
of the investigation.
 A written protocol should be developed. At a minimum, the protocol should outline the
outbreak response 
plan, including indications for initiating the plan, notification procedures, composition of
the response team, sources 
of staffing, plan for follow-up and treatment of contacts, indications for requesting CDC
assistance, and a process 
for  evaluation  of  the  outbreak  response.  The  outbreak  response  plan  should  also
include information on how to 
work  strategically  with  the  media  during  the  public  health  emergency.  CDC  offers
training packages to assist public HCWs 
in media communications, including emergency and crisis communication. This training
emphasizes prevent 
planning, 
event  response  activities,  and  post-event  follow-up.  Information  on  public  health
communication programs is available 
at http://www.cdc.gov/communication/cdcynergy.htm.
Targeted Testing and Treatment of LTBI
 An estimated 9.5--14.7 million persons in the United States have LTBI 
(39). Continued progress toward eliminating TB in the United States and reducing TB
among foreign-born persons will be impossible without devising 
effective  strategies  to  meet  this  challenge.  Guidelines  on  targeted  testing  and
treatment of LTBI have been published 
(4) and revised (308). Those guidelines include recommendations for diagnosing LTBI
and treating infected persons, limiting 
the  possibility  of  treatment-associated  hepatotoxicity,  and  identifying  persons  and
populations to target for testing. A 
new diagnostic test for LTBI, QFT-G, has been approved by FDA, and guidelines for its
use will be published by CDC. 
This section outlines a recommended approach to planning and implementing programs
for targeted testing and treatment 
of LTBI to create an effective public health tool for communitywide prevention of TB.
 Targeted  testing  and  treatment  of  persons  with  LTBI  is  not  a  new  concept  for  the
prevention of TB in the 
United States (309). The effectiveness of treating LTBI among populations at high risk
has been established in clinical 
trials  (285),  but  this  intervention  has  not  been  proven  to  have  an  impact  on  the
incidence of TB in the United 
States. Theoretically, the epidemiologic impact would be considerable if cases of TB in a
population were largely the result 
of  progression  of  LTBI  and  if  all  persons  at  high  risk  with  latent  infection  could  be
identified and treated 
successfully.  Practically,  those  circumstances  rarely  exist.  In  the  United  States,  the
effectiveness of targeted testing and treatment 
of LTBI as a public health measure has been limited by concern for the side effects of
treatment (notably 
hepatotoxocity) (310), poor acceptance of the intervention among health professionals 
(311), and poor adherence among patients to 
the lengthy course of treatment (45,312).
 Two approaches exist to increasing targeted testing and treatment of LTBI. One is to
promote clinic-based testing 
of persons who are under a clinician's care for a medical condition (e.g., HIV infection or
diabetes mellitus) that 
also confers a risk for acquiring TB. This approach, which depends on a person's risk
profile for TB and not on the 
local  epidemiology  of  the  disease,  requires  education  of  health-care  providers  and
depends ultimately on their 
initiative. Although difficulties exist in quantifying and evaluating its effectiveness, this
approach could conceivably become 
a  useful  tool  to  reduce  the  incidence  of  TB  among  foreign-born  and  other  persons  at
high risk because they can 
be accessed conveniently where they receive primary health-care services. The other
approach is to establish 
specific programs that target a subpopulation of persons who have a high prevalence of
LTBI or who are at high risk for 
acquiring TB disease if they have LTBI, or both. This 
approach presumes that the jurisdictional TB-control agency has 
identified  the  pockets  of  high  TB  risk  within  its  jurisdiction  through  epidemiologic
analysis and profiling 
(313--316).  Those  high-risk  pockets  might  consist  of  foreign-born,  homeless,  or
HIV-infected persons, or they might be geographic regions 
(e.g., a neighborhood within a city or town) or specific sites (e.g., a homeless shelter or
an HIV-housing facility).
 The  epidemiologic  profile  should  include  an  assessment  of  the  risk  for  TB  in  the
population or at the site, the ease 
of access to the population or site, and the likelihood of acceptance of and adherence
to targeted testing and treatment. 
For  this  assessment  to  be  facilitated,  populations  at  high  risk  may  be  separated  into
three tiers 
(Box 6). Assignment of groups to these three tiers is based on six criteria: 1) incidence
of TB; 2) prevalence of LTBI; 3) risk for 
acquiring TB disease if the person is infected with 
M. tuberculosis; 4) likelihood of accepting 
treatment for LTBI and adhering to it; 5) ease of access to the population; and 6) in a
congregate setting, the consequence of transmission of 
M. tuberculosis.
 Tier 1 is made up of well-defined populations at high risk that can also be conveniently
accessed and followed, 
either  in  locations  such  as  clinics  or  community  health  centers,  prisons,  or  other
congregate living sites or through 
mandatory registration. Persons in this tier often have a high prevalence of TB and LTBI
(immigrants and refugees with Class B 
TB notification status), an increased risk for TB disease if infected with 
M. tuberculosis (persons with HIV infection), or 
both (certain homeless and detained populations). The consequences of the spread of
TB in congregate settings increase 
the necessity of preventive action. Location-based, high-risk communities in Tier 1 are,
for the most part, readily 
identifiable and easily accessible; often have their own resources; and generally include
the probability of access for a long 
enough period to permit completion of treatment for LTBI. These populations should be
the first priority for targeted 
testing programs.
 Persons enrolled in substance-abuse treatment centers may be considered transitional
between Tier 1 and Tier 
2, depending on local epidemiologic and demographic factors. Substance abusers might
have a high prevalence of 
LTBI. Injection drug users also might have an increased risk for acquiring TB if they are
infected with 
M. tuberculosis and at increased risk for HIV infection 
(317). Access and factors related to acceptance and completion of therapy also 
might  vary  by  location.  Typically,  substance  abuse  treatment  centers  that  include
long-term inpatient treatment or 
regularly  scheduled  appointments  (e.g.,  methadone  treatment  centers)  are  the  best
choices for intervention 
because  ease  of  ongoing  access  allows  sufficient  time  for  completion  of  therapy.
Voluntary HIV counseling and testing should be 
offered routinely as part of any targeted testing program among this population.
 Populations in Tier 2 also include identifiable and accessible populations made up of
persons at high risk, but 
the  distinguishing  characteristic  is  that  obtaining  satisfactory  rates  of  completion  of
treatment for LTBI might be 
difficult because of dispersal of the population throughout a larger community or a brief
duration of residency in 
congregate  settings.  For  example,  in  Atlanta,  Georgia,  after  local  epidemiology  of  TB
was analyzed, community sites for 
targeted  testing  and  treatment  of  LTBI  of  residents  of  high-risk  inner-city  areas  were
identified 
(184). Sites of access included outpatient areas 
of the public hospital, the city jail, clinics serving homeless persons, and neighborhoods
frequented 
by substance abusers. Although 65% of the targeted population that had a tuberculin
skin test placed returned to have 
the skin test read, only 20% of those with an indication for treatment of LTBI completed
a course of therapy; 
this represented 1% of persons who underwent targeted testing.
 Tier 3 consists of persons born in countries with a high incidence of TB or U.S.-born
persons in racial/ethnic 
minority  populations  with  high  prevalence  of  LTBI  who  do  not  necessarily  have  an
increased risk for progressing to TB 
disease. Eventually, the control of TB among foreign-born persons and progress toward
elimination of TB in the United 
States  depends  on  achieving  greater  success  in  preventing  TB  among  populations  at
high risk by widespread targeted 
testing  and  treatment  of  LTBI  in  the  public  and  private  medical  sectors.  However,
establishing successful targeted testing 
and treatment programs for foreign-born persons who are not found in Tier 1 or Tier 2
settings is challenging. 
Obstacles include the limitations of the tuberculin skin test to differentiate 
between reactions attributable to BCG or infection with 
M.  tuberculosis,  the  prevalent  belief  among  a  substantial  number  of  foreign-born
persons that BCG vaccination 
is the cause of a positive test for 
M. tuberculosis infection and is also protective against TB disease, language and 
cultural  barriers,  barriers  in  access  to  medical  care,  and  difficulties  in  providing
outreach and education.
 Typical  Tier  3  populations  are  new  refugee  and  immigrant  groups  that  are  not  yet
assimilated into U.S. society. 
Such  populations  might  be  ignorant  of  their  TB  risk,  usually  lack  ready  access  to
health-care services, and might have 
strong  cultural  understandings  about  TB  that  are  at  variance  with  those  that  guide
TB-control activities in the United 
States. TB-prevention activities in this kind of community are highly cost-intensive 
(221). Engaging such communities is a challenging 
task.
 Community-based TB prevention for Tier 3 populations requires a partnership between
the jurisdictional 
health  department  and  the  affected  community.  The  community  should  gain  an
understanding of the TB problem as it 
relates  to  them  and  should  participate  in  the  design  of  the  intervention.  Community
education is essential for this approach 
to succeed. The target population should be involved in the 
design and implementation phases of the 
intervention,  interventions  should  be  developed  within  the  cultural  context  of  the
targeted population, and intermediate goals 
or  benchmarks  should  show  the  population  that  program  activities  are  achieving
success. For example, in Los 
Angeles,  California,  the  public  health  TB  program  contracted  with  community-based
organizations to screen and 
provide treatment for LTBI to persons at risk in Latino and Asian neighborhoods and at
schools teaching English as a 
second language (249). In Cambridge, Massachusetts, a coalition of 
Haitian community groups identified TB education as 
an issue for their community; strategies to achieve this goal included development of a
videotape written and produced 
for viewing in Haitian barbershops and beauty salons in the community, a lottery, and
measures for evaluation in terms 
of  knowledge  and  future  access  to  care  (S.  Etkind,  Massachusetts  Department  of
Health, personal communication, 2002).
 For communities in Tier 3, TB is only one (and often not the most important) of multiple
medical and public 
health  needs.  A  broad  approach  should  be  adopted  that  includes  TB  prevention  with
other activities to improve health 
status.  Certain  Tier  3  populations  have  achieved  sufficient  self-identity  and
development to establish access to health 
care through a community health center, individual medical providers, or clinics. Those
communities that have an 
already  established  route  of  access  to  health  care  have  an  infrastructure  in  place  to
establish programs for targeted testing 
and 
treatment of LTBI. Obstacles to overcome often include lack of medications and chest
radiographs, the need for a 
system to track patients who do not return for monthly appointments, and the capacity
to evaluate the program.
 Programs  for  population-based  targeted  testing  and  treatment  for  LTBI  often  have
been conducted by public 
health  agencies  through  TB-control  programs.  However,  recent  studies  have  also
described the establishment of such 
programs in nonpublic health venues. Promising results, in terms of access to persons
at high risk and completion of treatment 
of LTBI, have been achieved from nontraditional sites, including 
syringe exchanges (318), jails (256), neighborhood 
health clinics (319), homeless shelters 
(320), and schools (321,322). This trend indicates a widening interest in this means 
of preventing TB and is possibly influenced by the emergence of community-oriented
primary care 
(241,323), which places primacy on interventions for specific patients that help prevent
disease and preserve the health of the 
entire population from which these patients are drawn.
 As programs move from Tier 1 to Tier 2 and Tier 3 populations, the complexity of the
effort and the cost of 
the program will increase. Also, because persons in Tier 3 populations generally have a
lower risk for progression from 
LTBI to TB disease, the effectiveness and impact of a program will be less than efforts
directed to Tier 1 and Tier 
2 populations. Whatever population is selected or strategy is employed for the targeted
testing project, programs 
should  systematically  evaluate  the  activity  to  ensure  the  efficient  use  of  resources.
Process, outcome, and impact 
indicators should be selected and routinely monitored by the program.
 For purposes of monitoring and evaluation, activities 
associated with targeted testing and treatment for 
M. tuberculosis infection can be divided into three phases: the testing itself, the medical
evaluation of persons with positive test 
results, and the treatment of those persons with LTBI. Performance indicators should be
selected for each phase. For the 
testing phase, indicators include the number of persons at high risk identified and the
number and proportion of those 
that were actually tested. Among those tested, the number and proportion that had a
positive result for 
M. tuberculosis infection should be tracked. Useful indicators for the medical evaluation
phase include the proportion of persons with 
a  positive  test  result  who  completed  a  medical  evaluation  and  the  number  and
proportion that were determined to 
have TB disease. Indicators for the treatment phase include the proportion of eligible
persons starting treatment for LTBI 
and  the  number  and  proportion  that  completed  treatment.  Reasons  for  failure  to
complete treatment (e.g., adverse 
drug effects, loss of interest, and loss to follow-up) should be monitored. Costs should
be measured for each phase of 
the project. The cost per person with LTBI completing treatment provides a measure of
the relative efficiency of 
the  program.  Finally,  the  impact  of  the  program  can  be  estimated  by  estimating  the
number of cases of TB prevented, 
which is dependent on the number of persons completing treatment and the estimated
risk for 
progressing to TB disease.
 Surveillance of persons with LTBI does not routinely 
occur in the United States. However, CDC has 
recently  developed  a  national  surveillance  system  to  record  serious  adverse  events
(i.e., hospitalization or death) associated 
with treatment of LTBI. Surveillance of these events will provide data to evaluate the
safety of treatment 
regimens recommended in current guidelines 
(4,324).
Control of TB Among Populations at Risk
 This section contains recommendations for measures to control and prevent TB in five
populations (children, 
foreign-born  persons,  HIV-infected  persons,  homeless  persons,  and  detainees  and
prisoners in correctional facilities). Each of 
these populations occupies an important niche in the epidemiology of TB in the United
States. Individual members of 
each  population  have  been  demonstrated,  on  the  basis  of  their  membership  in  the
population, to be at higher risk for 
exposure  to  M.  tuberculosis  or  for  progression  from  exposure  to  disease,  or  both.
Furthermore, nationwide surveillance and 
surveys (27,118--120,127,136,139,150,198,295,315,325,326
) indicate that the epidemiology of TB in these populations is 
similar from community to community, which suggests that the recommended control
measures are subject to 
generalization and can be applied more or less uniformly throughout the United States.
 Children, foreign-born persons, HIV-infected persons, homeless persons, and detainees
and prisoners should not 
be assumed to be the only populations at high risk for TB, nor are homeless shelters
and detention facilities the 
only settings in need of enhanced TB-control strategies. Local surveillance and surveys
frequently have identified 
populations and settings of high TB risk and transmission that required the formulation
of specific control 
measures 
(122,137,152,313,315,316,327,328).  This  is  the  primary  reason  why  state  and  local
surveillance should be 
conducted  to  develop  a  clear  understanding  of  the  epidemiology  of  TB  at  the
jurisdictional level.
 Most  important,  the  concept  of  identifying  and  targeting  populations  and  settings  at
high risk should be viewed as 
a  dynamic  rather  than  as  a  static  process.  Such  populations  emerge  and  recede  in
importance at the local, state, 
and national levels. For example, foreign-born persons 
received little attention in the 1992 edition of this statement 
(6). A population whose risk for TB is now being recognized and delineated is U.S.-born
non-Hispanic blacks, who account 
for  approximately  25%  of  TB  morbidity  in  the  United  States  and  who  have  TB  rates
approximately eight times those 
of whites (329,330) (Table 2). CDC and collaborating public health agencies in Chicago,
Illinois and the states of 
Georgia and South Carolina are exploring new strategies to address this problem 
(331).
Control of TB Among Children and Adolescents
 The occurrence of TB among infants and young children indicates recent transmission
of 
M. tuberculosis and often the presence in the community of an unidentified adult with
infectious TB. Thus, a case of TB in a child is a sentinel 
health event that signals a public health breakdown 
(197). Also, certain features of TB among children mandate 
special considerations in case detection and case management, contact investigations,
and targeted testing and treatment 
of LTBI. For example, if LTBI results from exposure to TB in infancy and early childhood,
a 
substantial risk exists for rapid progression to TB disease, including the development of
potentially lethal forms of TB 
(198,294,325). The recommendations in this statement for control of TB among children
and adolescents should receive high priority in 
all state and community TB-control plans.
 
Basis for Recommendations for TB Control Among Children and Adolescents
 Case detection and primary prevention strategy: 
contact investigation of adults with pulmonary TB. 
The majority of infants and children who acquire TB disease do so within 3--12 months
of contracting 
M. tuberculosis infection. Infants and toddlers aged <3 years are especially prone to the
rapid progression from infection to disease, and they 
often acquire severe forms of TB, including meningitis and disseminated disease. The
most important step to detect 
and prevent TB among children is the timely identification and effective treatment of
adults with active TB. The 
cornerstone  of  TB  prevention  among  children  is  high-quality  contact  investigations  of
suspected cases of pulmonary TB in 
adults,  because  20%--40%  of  pediatric  cases  of  TB  could  have  been  prevented  if
contact investigation had been more 
timely and thorough (198,293,325).
 Contact investigation of adult pulmonary TB cases is crucial to the detection, control,
and prevention of pediatric 
TB and its complications (332,333). The yield of detection of TB and LTBI is high, with
an average of 50% of 
childhood household contacts having LTBI or TB disease 
(31,60). Because <50% of cases of TB among children are 
asymptomatic  despite  abnormal  radiographic  findings,  contact  investigation  leads  to
earlier discovery of TB among children, 
better treatment outcomes, and fewer complications 
(326). Also, children with LTBI or TB disease identified through 
contact investigation are more likely to receive DOT at the same time 
as the source-case, which increases adherence to therapy.
 Another benefit of contact investigations is the ability to identify and treat infants and
young children who have 
been exposed to a person with a contagious case of TB and who might be infected but
nevertheless have a negative 
tuberculin skin test (the role of QFT-G for diagnosis of LTBI in children aged <17 years
has not been determined). A 
tuberculin  skin  test  might  take  2--3  months  after  infection  to  become  positive  in  an
infant or toddler. However, the 
incubation period for severe TB, including meningitis and disseminated disease, might
be only 4--6 weeks. Failure to give 
empiric  treatment  for  LTBI  to  exposed  infants  and  young  children  with  negative
tuberculin skin test results, particularly 
those aged <3 years, might therefore result in rapid acquisition of 
disease (295,325).
 Case  management.  The  record  for  adherence  to  treatment  for  TB  is  no  better  for
children than it is for adults 
(333). Children with TB might live in socially disorganized or disadvantaged homes and
receive care from multiple adults. 
A chaotic environment can lead to a poor understanding of TB and its treatment and
decreased 
adherence. DOT is effective in TB treatment for children and adolescents. 
However, almost 10% of children receiving DOT experience 
gaps in treatment that require extensions of therapy 
(326). Intensive-case management, including use of incentives 
and enablers, is a crucial element of a TB-treatment plan for children.
 Contact investigation of cases of TB among children and adolescents. 
Contact  investigations  for  children  with  suspected  TB  are  generally  conducted  to
identify the adult source-case. Identifying a source-case serves to establish 
the diagnosis of TB in the majority of children and, if the source-case is culture-positive
for 
M. tuberculosis, to determine the likely drug susceptibility pattern of the infecting strain
of 
M. tuberculosis in the child.
 Even with optimal medical evaluation, 
M. tuberculosis can be isolated from <50% of children with clinically 
suspected  TB.  While  microbiologic  testing  determines  the  diagnosis  of  TB  for  the
majority of adults, positive culture results 
often are lacking for children. In the majority of cases, the diagnosis of pediatric TB is
established by the triad of 1) a 
positive tuberculin skin test result, 2) either an abnormal chest radiograph or physical
examination or both, and 3) discovery of 
a link to a known or suspected case of contagious pulmonary TB. 
Because culture yields from children with TB are 
low,  determining  the  drug  susceptibility  pattern  from  the  source-case  isolate  often  is
the only way to determine 
optimal treatment for children with either LTBI or TB disease 
(334,335).
 Because TB among infants and young children usually 
occurs within weeks to months of contracting infection 
with M. tuberculosis, having a child with disease is a marker of 
recent transmission from someone in the child's 
environment. The source-case, often a parent or other caregiver 
(336--338), might not have been identified as having TB by the 
time  the  child  becomes  ill.  Consequently,  parents  and  other  adults  who  are  close
contacts of children hospitalized with 
TB  should  be  evaluated  themselves  for  TB  disease  as  soon  as  possible  to  serve  as  a
case-detection tool and to 
prevent nosocomial transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  (339).  A  chest  radiograph  should  be  performed  on  these  family
members 
to exclude pulmonary TB; certain centers have implemented this recommendation by
requiring that adults who 
accompany  a  child  have  a  chest  radiograph  performed  and  interpreted  immediately
while at the health-care facility 
(339). Other adult family members or friends also should be required to show evidence
of a normal chest radiograph, performed 
by  the  health  department  or  other  provider,  before  being  allowed  to  visit  the  child.
Because TB in the child, not LTBI, 
is the reliable marker of recent infection, chest radiograph screening of accompanying
adults is not necessary if the 
child has LTBI without TB disease.
 Associate investigations (i.e., efforts to identify and evaluate household contacts of a
child with LTBI to identify 
the infectious person responsible for the child's infection) are 
often performed as part of the evaluation of a child with 
LTBI  (5,17,340--343).  The  usefulness  of  this  approach  depends  on  the  criteria  for
placing skin tests on children. If testing 
of children at low risk is undertaken, associate investigations will be costly, have a low
yield, and divert 
TB-control resources from more important activities. Associate investigations of children
at high risk, however, usually detect 
a limited number of persons with TB but do identify substantial numbers of other 
persons with LTBI who are candidates for treatment 
(341--343).
 Targeted  testing  and  treatment  of  LTBI.  In  the  1950s  and  1960s,  child-centered  TB
control activities were based 
on periodic testing of all children for LTBI 
(344). However, as the number of TB cases dropped, the disease 
became  concentrated  among  persons  at  high  risk  in  particular  subpopulations.
Consequently, the majority of U.S. children 
have  negligible  risk  for  acquiring  LTBI.  Among  children  at  low  risk,  the  majority  of
positive tuberculin skin test results 
are  false  positives  caused  by  nonspecific  reactivity  or  exposure  to  nontuberculous
mycobacteria in the environment 
(344). False-positive results lead to unnecessary health-care expenditures and anxiety
for the child, family, school, and 
HCWs  (345).  Thus,  while  the  testing  of  children  with  an  expected  high  prevalence  of
LTBI is desirable, mass testing of 
children  with  a  low  prevalence  of  LTBI  is  counterproductive  and  should  not  be
undertaken.
 The optimal approach is to perform tuberculin skin testing only on those children with
specific risk factors for 
LTBI. A questionnaire that assesses risk factors for TB can be used successfully in clinics
and private offices to identify 
children  at  risk  for  LTBI  (237,346--348);  this  approach  can  also  be  used  to  identify
at-risk college students 
(349).  The  screening  tool  is  the  questionnaire;  only  those  children  whose  answers
indicate that they are at risk for LTBI should receive 
a  tuberculin  skin  test.  Use  of  a  questionnaire  can  also  address  issues  related  to
discrimination; all children in a setting 
such  as  a  school  or  child-care  center  can  be  screened  easily,  but  only  those  with
identified risk factors for LTBI should 
receive a tuberculin skin test, thereby diminishing the number of false-positive results.
 No single questionnaire has been validated for use in all settings and for all ages of
children. Factors that 
have correlated highly with risk for LTBI among children in more than one study include
1) previous positive tuberculin 
skin test result; 2) birth in a foreign country with high prevalence; 
3) nontourist travel to a high-prevalence country for 
>1 week; 4) contact with person with TB; and 5) presence in the 
household of another person with LTBI. Questions 
pertaining to a locally identified population with a high rate of TB should be included in
a questionnaire, but 
validation of these questions is difficult.
 In  certain  treatment  programs  for  LTBI  among  children  in  the  United  States,  the
completion rate associated with 
6--9  months  of  self-supervised  isoniazid  therapy  is  only  30%--50%.  As  LTBI  among
young children might progress 
rapidly to TB disease, DOT is recommended. Children with LTBI, who are most likely to
benefit from DOT 
because of their high risk for rapid progression of infection to disease, include contacts
of persons with recently diagnosed cases 
of  pulmonary  TB,  infants  and  young  children,  and  children  with  immunologic
deficiencies, especially HIV infection.
Control of TB Among Foreign-Born Persons
 TB  among  foreign-born  persons  is  of  increasing  importance.  During  1992--2003,  the
number of TB 
cases decreased 64% among U.S.-born persons but increased 8% among persons born
outside the United States 
(14,15).  During  1992--2003,  the  percentage  of  TB  cases  in  the  United  States  that
occurred among foreign-born 
persons increased from 27% in 1992 to 53.3% in 2003 
(15), and the number of states in which >50% of reported cases of 
TB occurred among foreign-born persons increased from four (8%) in 1992 to 25 (50%)
in 2003 
(15). In 2003, eight states (California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New
York, Texas, and Virginia) accounted for 71% 
of  cases  among  foreign-born  persons.  Foreign-born  persons  with  TB  have  been  more
likely than U.S.-born persons 
to harbor drug-resistant strains of 
M. tuberculosis; in 2003, 10.6% of foreign-born persons with TB had TB with 
primary isoniazid resistance, compared with 4.6% of U.S.-born 
persons with TB (14).
 The increase in cases of TB among foreign-born persons has been attributed to at least
three factors 
(350). First, the number of persons entering the United States from other countries in
which TB occurs with high incidence 
(44) now accounts for >75% of the immigrant flow 
(116,278); during 1994--2003, an estimated 80%--86% of 
immigrants admitted to the United States came from high-incidence countries 
(351). Second, foreign-born persons are subject 
to cultural and linguistic barriers that might affect health-seeking behavior and access
to medical care, resulting in delays 
in diagnosis and difficulty in understanding and completing treatment 
(18,19,194,325). Third, these barriers, which 
have implications for the treatment, control, and prevention of TB among foreign-born
persons, have not been 
sufficiently appreciated and addressed in TB-control 
program planning in the United States.
 Precise information is lacking to assist in the identification of foreign-born persons who
have an elevated risk 
for  acquiring  TB  during  residence  in  the  United  States.  Immigrants  entering  either
Canada or the United States have a 
risk for TB during their early years of residence that 
approximates that of residents of the country of birth 
(115,352,353). Over time, the risk declines and approaches that of residents of the host
country. Consequently, recent guidelines 
have  designated  immigrants  from  countries  with  a  high  prevalence  of  TB  who  have
resided in the United States <5 years 
as foreign-born persons at high risk (4).
 Criteria for characterizing countries as having a high prevalence of TB have not been
developed, and no 
consensus exists on which countries should be designated as having a high prevalence
of TB. In rank order, the 14 countries 
listed most frequently as country of origin of foreign-born persons with reported TB in
the United States are Mexico, 
the Philippines, Vietnam, India, China, Haiti, South Korea, Somalia, Guatemala, Ecuador,
Ethiopia, Peru, El Salvador, 
and Honduras), and these 14 countries accounted for 76% of cases among foreign-born
persons during 1999--2002 
(14).  Estimated  incidence  rates  of  TB  in  these  countries  in  2002  ranged  from
33/100,000 population (Mexico) to 
406/100,000 population (Somalia) (354). However, the country of origin of foreign-born
persons with TB can 
vary  substantially  among  localities  within  a  state  and  between  states  and  regions
across the United States.
 State  and  local  TB  control  programs  should  develop  their  own  profiles  of  risk  for  TB
among foreign-born persons 
as part of the jurisdiction's overall epidemiologic analysis of TB and then define which
immigrant and 
foreign-born populations in their areas should be considered as being at high risk for
TB. Data sources for TB programs to use 
in making this determination include 1) WHO data on the estimated incidence of TB in
countries of origin 
(354); 2) local epidemiologic and surveillance data 
(151,152,313--316,355); 3) published guidelines 
(4,279), and other sources of data 
(115,116); 4) qualitative information on refugee and 
immigrant movement into the jurisdiction; and 5) 
availability of resources to establish control and prevention measures 
targeted toward the foreign-born population. The 
principles and priorities of TB control among foreign-born persons at high risk are not
different from those for control of 
TB 
among U.S.-born persons (Box 4). However, for the reasons given previously, TB control
among foreign-born persons 
at high risk might present challenges requiring targeted strategies 
specific to that population (152,356).
 
How Foreign-Born Persons Enter the United States
 Foreign-born persons enter the United States legally through different official channels 
(Table  7).  As  a  condition  of  entry,  persons  migrating  as  immigrants,  refugees,  and
asylees are 
required to be screened for diseases of public 
health significance, including TB. Persons entering in the nonimmigrant category do not
require preentry screening. 
Persons  who  enter  the  country  without  legal  documentation  are  referred  to  as
unauthorized aliens.
 During 1992--2002, an estimated 380,000--536,000 persons entered the United States
annually as 
immigrants,  refugees,  or  asylees  (Table  8).  In  2002,  among  the  estimated  516,000
persons in those categories, 86.6% were 
from countries with high incidence of TB. Immigrants, refugees, and asylees constitute
only a fraction of foreign-born 
persons who enter the United States each year; the majority (20--35 million persons)
enter in one of the 
nonimmigrant subcategories (Table 8). The majority of entering nonimmigrants are 
tourists  or  business  travelers  who  spend  only  a  short  time  in  the  United  States.
However, an estimated 850,000--1.9 million workers, students, and other visitors 
and their families might reside in the United States for multiple years (Table 8).
 A  nonimmigrant,  refugee,  or  asylee  residing  in  the  United  States  who  meets  the
eligibility requirements and applies 
for  a  change  in  visa  status  to  that  of  a  lawful  permanent  resident  should  undergo
required health screening assessment by 
a  civil  surgeon.  During  2002,  of  the  679,305  persons  who  adjusted  their  immigration
status under this 
program, 536,995 (79%) were from countries with high incidence of TB 
(238). In addition, an estimated 7 million 
unauthorized  aliens  resided  in  the  United  States  in  January  2000,  and  during
1990--1999, the unauthorized alien 
population increased annually by approximately 350,000 persons 
(357).
 
Current Requirements for TB Screening of Immigrants
 U.S.  immigration  law  mandates  screening  outside  the  United  States  for  applicants
designated as immigrants who 
are applying for permanent residence status and for applicants designated as refugees
or asylees (Table 7). The purpose 
of  mandated  screening  is  to  deny  entry  to  persons  who  have  either  communicable
diseases of public health import 
or physical or mental disorders associated with harmful behavior, abuse drugs or are
addicted to drugs, or are likely 
to become wards of the state. The current list of infectious 
diseases of public health significance that are grounds 
for  exclusion  include  infectious  TB,  HIV  infection,  leprosy,  and  certain  sexually
transmitted diseases 
(358).  Worldwide,  approximately  400  licensed  local  physicians,  designated  as  "panel
physicians," perform these medical 
examinations.  Panel  physicians  are  appointed  by  U.S.  embassies  and  consulates  that
issue visas. CDC is 
responsible for monitoring the quality of these examinations and for 
providing technical guidance and consultation for TB 
diagnosis and treatment.
 The TB screening process is a program for active TB case detection designed to deny
entry to persons with 
infectious pulmonary TB (identified by positive sputum AFB smear 
results). For persons aged >15 years, a brief medical 
history and a chest radiograph are obtained 
(Figure 4). If the chest radiograph is considered compatible with pulmonary 
TB, three sputum specimens are obtained and examined for AFB. 
Although procedures vary from site to site, smears 
are usually performed by Ziehl-Neelsen staining and examined with light microscopy.
Cultures for 
M.  tuberculosis  are  not  required  and  are  not  routinely  performed.  Persons  aged  <15
years are evaluated only if they have symptoms that 
are consistent with TB or are a contact of person with infectious TB. A test for 
M. tuberculosis infection is performed, and 
a chest radiograph is obtained if the test is positive or if the child is suspected to have
TB. 
 Persons  with  abnormal  chest  radiographs  suggestive  of  TB  and  with  AFB-positive
sputum smear results are classified 
as having Class A TB, which is an excludable condition for 
entry into the United States (358). Persons so designated 
have two options: 1) to complete a course of treatment for TB, including documented
negative sputum AFB smears at 
the  end  of  treatment,  at  which  point  they  are  classified  according  to  their  chest
radiograph results and may enter the 
United States; or 2) to receive TB treatment until sputum smear 
results for AFB convert from positive to negative and 
then  apply  for  an  immigration  waiver.  A  U.S.  health-care  provider  who  agrees  to
assume responsibility for the completion 
of TB treatment after a person's arrival in the United States should sign the waiver. The
waiver is countersigned by 
a representative of the jurisdictional public health agency of the person's intended U.S.
destination. An applicant 
whose chest radiograph is compatible with active TB but whose sputum AFB smear 
results are negative is classified as having 
Class B1 status and may enter the United States. If the chest radiograph is compatible
with inactive TB, no 
sputum  specimens  are  required,  and  the  applicant  enters  the  country  with  Class  B2
status 
(358).
 Immigrants with a Class A waiver or with Class B1 or B2 status are identified at ports of
entry to the United States 
by CIS on entry to the United States and reported to CDC's Division of Global Migration
and Quarantine 
(DGMQ). DGMQ notifies state and local health departments of refugees and immigrants
with TB classifications who are 
moving  to  their  jurisdiction  and  need  follow-up  evaluations.  Persons  with  a  Class  A
waiver are required to report to 
the  jurisdictional  public  health  agency  for  evaluation  or  risk  deportation.  For  persons
with Class B1 and B2 status, 
however, the stipulated evaluation visits to the health agency are voluntary.
 
Persons Seeking Adjustment of Status After Arrival
 Persons seeking to adjust their immigration status after 
residing in the United States with nonimmigrant visa 
status  should  undergo  a  medical  evaluation  by  one  of  the  approximately  3,000  U.S.
medical practitioners designated 
by DGMQ as civil surgeons. TB screening by civil surgeons is based on tuberculin skin
testing; QFT-G is also approved 
for  detecting  LTBI.  If  an  applicant  seeking  adjustment  of  status  has  a  tuberculin  skin
test reading of 
>5 mm, a chest radiograph is required. If the radiograph is compatible with active TB,
the person is referred to the jurisdictional 
public health agency for further evaluation 
(358). Civil surgeons are also advised that persons with a positive tuberculin 
test result and no signs or symptoms of TB disease should be referred to public health
agencies for evaluation for 
treatment of LTBI, following ATS/CDC/IDSA guidelines 
(4,324).
 Because  data  on  the  outcomes  of  TB  screening  of  persons  seeking  to  adjust  their
immigration status are not 
aggregated  or  analyzed,  only  limited  information  is  available.  In  an  evaluation  of  the
screening practices in five U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service jurisdictions, among 5,739 applicants eligible for
screening through tuberculin skin 
testing, 4,290 (75%) were considered to have been screened appropriately 
(240). In Denver, Colorado, where health department physicians serve as civil surgeons,
7,573 persons were evaluated for adjustment of status during May 
1987--December  1988  (239).  Applicants  were  screened  with  tuberculin  skin  testing,
chest radiographs, or both. Among 
4,840 applicants that had a tuberculin skin test placed, 2,039 (42%) had a reaction 
>10 mm. Sixteen persons (0.7%) were sputum 
culture-positive for M. tuberculosis. Therapy with isoniazid was recommended for 1,029 
applicants, of whom 716 (70%) completed 6 months of treatment.
 
Immigration Status of Foreign-Born Persons with TB
 Studies have sought to identify the initial immigration status of foreign-born persons
with reported TB. During 
1992--1993 in Hawaii, 78% of TB cases occurred among immigrants, 4% among student
nonimmigrants, and 4% 
among nonimmigrant tourists (350); in 14% of cases, the immigration status could not
be determined. During 1992--1994 
in Seattle, Washington, 58% of TB cases among 
foreign-born persons who had resided in the United States for <1 
year occurred among immigrants or refugees 
(293); immigration status was not determined among the remaining 
foreign-born persons. During 1998--2000, a total of 59% of foreign-born persons with TB
in Tarrant County, Texas, 
were immigrants or refugees, 24% were unauthorized 
immigrants, and 17% were nonimmigrant students and workers 
(316).
 
Assessment of TB Screening Requirements for Immigrants
 The  priority  for  immigration  screening  efforts  is  to  detect  cases  of  pulmonary  TB
among persons applying 
for  permanent  residence  in  the  United  States  and  to  prevent  the  most  infectious
persons from entering the United 
States. However, requirements for screening outside the United States do not apply to
the majority of foreign-born 
persons  entering  the  United  States  because  those  classified  as  nonimmigrants  and
unauthorized immigrants do not 
undergo screening (Table 7) (277).
 Furthermore, a significant proportion of immigrants with Class B1 (4%--14%) and B2
(0.4%--4%) status allowed 
to enter the United States with abnormal chest radiographs 
because of having AFB-negative sputum smears on 
screening  outside  the  United  States  are  later  discovered  (on  the  basis  of  follow-up
evaluations by U.S. public health agencies) 
to have active TB at the time of entry (350). This finding has great 
importance for TB-control activities in certain 
U.S. jurisdictions.
 IOM,  NTCA,  and  CDC  have  suggested  changes  in  the  screening  procedures  for
immigrants, as follows:
 
TB Control at the U.S.-Mexican Border
 The  U.S.-Mexican  border  presents  specific  challenges  to  TB  control.  Four  U.S.  states
(California, Arizona, 
New  Mexico,  and  Texas)  and  six  Mexican  states  (Baja  California  Norte,  Sonora,
Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, 
and Tamaulipas) comprise the U.S.-Mexican border, and an estimated 1 million persons
cross the border daily. In the 
six  Mexican  border  states,  estimated  annual  TB  incidence  is  27.1  cases/100,000
population, compared with 5.1 
cases/100,000 population in the United States 
(359). In 1999, Mexico was the country of origin for 23% of 
foreign-born  persons  in  the  United  States  with  reported  TB,  and  75%  of  those  cases
were reported from the four U.S. border 
states.  In  1996,  those  same  states  reported  83%  of  TB  cases  among  foreign-born
Hispanics 
(360). The high rate of TB at the border, the substantial number of border crossings, the
substantial geographic area involved, and the prevalent 
cultural and linguistic barriers make TB control a challenge in this region.
 Recommendations to improve TB control at the 
U.S.-Mexican border have been published 
(361).  These  recommendations  include  use  of  a  binational  case  definition  and
development of a binational registry of TB 
cases,  improvements  in  clinical  care  of  binational  TB  patients  and  close  contacts  by
cross-border case-management 
strategies, development of performance indicators for these activities, and setting 
research priorities (361).
 
Basis for Recommendations on TB Control Among Foreign-Born Persons
 Surveillance. The inability to distinguish imported TB present at the time of entry of
foreign-born persons into 
the  United  States  from  domestically  occurring  disease  obscures  the  progress  that
certain states and cities have made in 
TB control. Standardized reporting of new TB cases does not 
allow separating TB among foreign-born persons that 
is  present  at  the  time  of  entry  from  cases  that  arise  during  residence  in  the  United
States. This is more than a 
semantic  distinction  because  cases  of  TB  that  occur  among  short-term  visitors  and
workers, students, and unauthorized aliens 
are counted as U.S. incident cases even though a substantial number are imported 
(115).  Surveys  using  sputum  cultures  indicate  that  4%--13%  of  immigrants  and
refugees with Class B1 status have TB disease at the time of entry 
(279).  TB  present  at  the  time  of  entry  is  likely  to  contribute  to  the  higher  incidence
rates of TB noted among foreign-born 
persons in the first 2 years after arrival 
(115). The importance of imported cases and the need to distinguish them from 
domestic  cases  has  also  been  demonstrated  in  the  smallpox,  polio,  and  measles
eradication efforts in North America.
 Case detection. Multiple factors common to the experience of foreign-born persons in
the United States might lead 
to delays in the detection of TB. Preexisting culturally derived beliefs about TB might
serve as a disincentive to seek 
health care when symptoms of TB are experienced 
(18,279). Also, foreign-born persons wishing to receive a medical 
evaluation might encounter financial, linguistic, or other barriers to 
access (19). Once medical services are sought, 
foreign-born  persons  are  likely  to  receive  their  evaluation  from  certain  kinds  of
health-care providers (e.g., foreign-born physicians 
or  those  working  in  community  health  centers  or  hospital  EDs)  rather  than  from  TB
clinics conducted by public 
health 
agencies. These challenges to optimal case detection among foreign-born persons will
require 1) targeted 
public  education  for  foreign-born  populations  at  high  risk  to  explain  that  TB  is  a
treatable, curable disease; 2) better access 
to  medical  services,  especially  for  recently  arrived  immigrants  and  refugees;  and  3)
maintenance of clinical expertise in 
the diagnosis and management of TB among medical practitioners (Box 1).
 The  TB-screening  process  for  visa  applicants  (i.e.,  identification  of  persons  with
abnormal chest radiographs) 
has  provided  opportunities  for  active  case  detection  in  follow-up  evaluations  in  the
United States. Data derived 
from  programs  that  have  sought  to  identify  active  TB  cases  on  the  basis  of  positive
sputum cultures for 
M.  tuberculosis  among  immigrants  with  Class  B  notification  status  indicate  that
3%--14% of the approximately 6,000 immigrants with 
Class B1 status who enter the United States each year and 0.4%--4.5% of the 12,000
immigrants with Class B2 status 
have  TB  at  the  time  of  entry  (279).  In  San  Francisco,  California,  during  July
1992--December 1993, of 182 
immigrants  with  Class  B1  status  who  received  follow-up  evaluations,  27  (14.8%)  had
active TB, and 134 (73.3%) had inactive TB 
(362). Among 547 immigrants with Class B2 status, 24 (4.3%) had active TB, and 301
(54.5%) had inactive TB. 
In California, 3.5% of all persons with a Class B notification status who arrived during
January 1992--September 
1995 were reported to have active TB <1 year of arrival 
(277). Recent arrivals with Class B notification status accounted 
for 38% of all foreign-born persons with TB reported 
<1 year of arrival. Among 124 immigrants and refugees in 
Hawaii who were reported during 1992--1993 to have TB 
<1 year of arrival, 78 (63%) had been classified as having Class 
B1 status and 17 (14%) as having Class B2 status 
(350). However, a study from Los Angeles suggested that the 
visa application process was more effective in identifying cases among persons recently
arrived from Southeast Asia 
than among those from Mexico and Central America 
(363).
 An  active  Class  B1/B2  follow-up  program  can  be  relatively  cost  effective.  During
October 1995--June 1996, in 
Santa  Clara  County,  California,  87%  of  immigrants  with  Class  B  status  responded  to
letters inviting them to receive a 
follow-up  evaluation,  resulting  in  a  cost  of  $9.90  to  locate  one  immigrant  with  Class
B1/B2 status and $175.88 to locate 
one person with TB (364).
 Case  management.  As  with  case  detection,  cultural  and  linguistic  differences  might
impede successful 
treatment outcomes among foreign-born persons. Case management of persons whose
primary language is not English depends 
on reliable and competent medical translation. Providers and agencies that work with
foreign-born patients at high 
risk should ensure that adequate translation and interpretation services are available.
In jurisdictions in which the majority 
of the cases occur among foreign-born person, providing these services can be costly.
For example, in 2000, the 
Tarrant
 County
 Health
 Department
 TB
 Program
 (Fort
 Worth,
 Texas),
 spent
approximately $24,000 on professional 
translation services (365). Ideally, professional services should be used for translation
rather than relatives or family friends 
(365).
 Culturally  derived  attitudes  and  beliefs  about  TB  and  its  treatment  can  also  be
impediments to the management of 
TB  among  foreign-born  persons.  Each  culture  has  its  own  knowledge,  attitudes,  and
beliefs about TB and how it should 
be  treated.  For  example,  in  a  study  that  used  focus  groups  to  evaluate  attitudes
regarding TB among Filipino 
immigrants, participants expressed a belief that TB was extremely contagious 
(264) and mentioned the associated social stigma 
and  isolation.  Although  all  participants  agreed  that  medical  therapy  was  necessary,
participants also trusted the 
effectiveness of traditional treatments. As more of the burden of TB in the United States
is borne by foreign-born persons, the 
need for health-care providers to understand cultural attitudes toward TB will increase.
 Case  management  is  particularly  difficult  at  the  U.S.-Mexico  border  where,  until
recently, tracking systems for 
persons who migrated between the two countries were not in place. A new binational
system has been established to 
ensure continuity of care and completion of TB treatment for patients who 
migrate  between  the  United  States  and  Mexico  and  to  coordinate  the  referral  of
patients between the health systems of both countries. The project is now being tested 
in four U.S.-Mexican jurisdictions (San Diego, California, and Tijuana, Baja California; El
Paso, Texas--Las Cruces, 
New Mexico, and Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua; Webb and Cameron Counties, Texas, and
Matamoros, Tamaulipas; and 
Arizona and Sonora). If the pilot project proves successful, this binational TB 
patient referral and information system will 
likely be expanded to other parts of the United States and Mexico.
 Contact  investigation.  Contact  investigations  have  a  particularly  high  yield  when
conducted on foreign-born 
patients. In Seattle, for example, contacts of foreign-born persons with TB were more
numerous (6.0 versus 3.4 per case) 
and  substantially  more  likely  to  be  have  positive  tuberculin  skin  test  results  (50%
versus 18%) and to be started 
on treatment for LTBI (40% versus 23%) than were contacts of U.S.-born persons with
TB 
(293). A multicenter survey 
from around the United States demonstrated that the 
tuberculin skin test was positive among 71% of 
foreign-born contacts compared with 32% of all close contacts 
(31). Although not all foreign-born contacts identified during 
a  contact  investigation  are  recently  infected,  the  majority  would  nevertheless  be
considered candidates for treatment 
of  LTBI  under  current  guidelines  (4).  In  addition,  a  Canadian  study  indicated  that
contact investigations were more 
cost effective than preimmigration screening and postarrival surveillance 
(276).
 Targeted  testing  and  treatment  of  LTBI.  Surveys  using  molecular  epidemiologic
methods have 
consistently demonstrated that less clustering of 
M. tuberculosis isolates occurs from foreign-born patients than from 
U.S.-born  patients;  this  has  been  interpreted  as  evidence  that  less  person-to-person
spread of TB occurs among 
foreign-born persons in the United States and that the majority of cases of TB among
foreign-born persons occur as a result 
of activation of a latent infection 
(150--152,356). In fact, one reason for the lack of progress in reducing TB 
among  foreign-born  persons  might  be  that  insufficient  attention  has  been  given  to
targeted testing and treatment 
(152), which should be the most applicable prevention strategy for this population, in
which TB disease occurs mainly by 
progression from LTBI.
 The success of programs for targeted testing and treatment of LTBI among populations
at high risk in the 
United  States  has  been  thwarted  by  poor  interest  in  the  intervention  on  the  part  of
medical practitioners and poor adherence 
by  patients  (51).  Among  foreign-born  persons,  these  problems  are  magnified  by  the
lack of access to care and by 
cultural  and  linguistic  obstacles.  Successful  models  for  administering  targeted  testing
and treatment of LTBI among refugees 
have been published; these models are resource-intensive and require a commitment
to working within the 
population's  cultural  contexts  (202,221).  In  addition,  the  use  of  DOT  increases
treatment completion rates 
(366).
 Other  opportunities  to  conveniently  access  foreign-born  persons  for  targeted  testing
programs include 
school-based testing of foreign-born students. The majority of persons 
residing as students in the United States remain long 
enough  to  receive  targeted  testing  for  LTBI  and,  if  TB  is  diagnosed,  to  complete  a
course of treatment. Screening for TB 
is  required  by  61%  of  colleges  and  universities:  for  all  students  in  26%,  for  all
international students in 8%, and 
for students in specific academic programs in 47% 
(367). School-based screening also has been evaluated among 
younger students (150,322,345). In California, widespread TB screening of kindergarten
and high school students yielded a 
low  prevalence  of  skin  test  reactors  and  a  limited  number  of  cases  of  TB,  but
foreign-born students were >30 times 
more likely than U.S.-born students to have the infection 
(345). In a cost-benefit analysis, screening all students would 
be expected to prevent 14.9 cases/10,000 children screened, whereas targeted testing
would prevent 84.9 
cases/10,000 screened and would be less costly 
(345).
Control of TB Among Persons with HIV Infection
 HIV  and  M.  tuberculosis  interact  in  ways  that  tend  to  worsen  both  diseases  among
coinfected persons 
(368). When a person with HIV infection is exposed to a patient with infectious TB, the
risk for acquiring TB disease soon after 
that exposure is markedly increased (369). In outbreaks in which the start of exposure
could be determined, 
HIV-infected  persons  acquired  active  TB  in  as  little  as  a  month  after  exposure  to  a
person with infectious TB 
(136). HIV coinfection is also a highly potent risk factor for progression from LTBI to TB 
(44,46,370). Persons with LTBI and HIV 
coinfection have a risk for progressing to TB disease of approximately 10%/year 
(317,371,372), which is 113--170 times 
greater than the risk for a person with LTBI who is HIV-seronegative and has no other
risk factors 
(4,44).
 On a global level, HIV infection has had a substantial effect on the epidemiology of TB.
Areas of the world 
most heavily affected by the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS (e.g., 
sub-Saharan Africa) have also sustained increases in 
the incidence of TB (44,46,373). TB is the most common 
infectious complication and the most common cause of 
death among persons with HIV/AIDS in places where the incidence of both diseases is
high 
(374).  In  the  United  States,  HIV  infection  has  been  associated  with  TB  outbreaks  in
institutional 
settings, including health-care facilities 
(53), correctional facilities (37), and homeless shelters 
(33).
 Before the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the early 1990s,
HIV infection caused 
a progressive decline in immune competence and death. However, the use of HAART
using combination therapy 
plus protease inhibitors has prolonged the survival among persons with HIV infection 
(375--377). The introduction of HAART has also decreased the incidence of TB among
HIV-infected persons: an 80% decrease in risk for TB has 
been demonstrated among HIV-infected persons receiving HAART 
(378).
 With the declining incidence of TB in the United States since 1992, the incidence of HIV
infection among 
persons with TB also has decreased. This is likely attributable to 
increased understanding of the biologic interactions 
between the two pathogens, leading to more targeted TB-control 
efforts and to the introduction of HAART. Another factor 
is improved TB infection control in health-care facilities, 
because HIV- infected persons were particularly affected 
by health-care--associated transmission of 
M. tuberculosis (53).
 HIV infection was a prominent cause of the 1985--1992 TB resurgence in the United
States, especially the 
incursion  of  health-care--associated  TB  (including  multidrug-resistant  disease).  That
fact, along with the knowledge that 
the global epidemics of HIV infection and TB are continuing unabated 
(44), dictates a high degree of respect and 
vigilance  for  the  adverse  consequences  that  HIV  infection  could  impose  on  the
epidemiology of TB in the United States.
 
Basis for Recommendations of Control of TB Among Persons with HIV Infection
 HIV counseling and testing. Knowledge of the presence of HIV infection among patients
with TB is useful 
for  surveillance  purposes  to  ensure  that  an  optimal  drug  regimen  is  chosen  for
treatment 
(5),  refer  persons  for  HIV  primary  care  if  the  case  is  newly  detected,  and  guide
decisions about 
contact investigations. TB is frequently the first illness 
that brings a person who has not previously received a diagnosis of HIV infection into
the health-care system.
 Voluntary counseling and testing for HIV is recommended for all patients with TB 
(5),  but  this  recommendation  has  not  been  fully  implemented,  and  reporting  of  HIV
among persons with TB is incomplete 
(14). In 2003, HIV testing was performed for <50% of patients reported with TB in the
United States, and only 63% of persons in the age group 
at greatest risk (persons aged 25--44 years) were tested 
(14). HIV counseling and testing has also been recommended 
for contacts of persons with TB (302). However, recent data indicate that contacts of
HIV-infected persons with TB have 
a high rate of HIV infection but that contacts of persons with TB without HIV infection do
not 
(301).  HIV  testing  for  other  persons  with  LTBI  should  be  limited  to  those  who  have
clinical or behavioral risk factors for HIV infection.
 Case detection. HIV coinfection affects the clinical and radiographic manifestations of
TB. HIV-infected patients 
are more likely than persons without HIV infection to have extrapulmonary and miliary
TB 
(379,380), and those who have pulmonary TB tend to have atypical findings (e.g., they
are less likely to have apical cavities and are more likely to 
have
 lower
 lobe
 or
 instititial
 infiltrates
 and
 mediastinal
 or
 paratracheal
lymphadenopathy). These atypical features are 
heavily dependent on the patient's CD4 cell count; those with CD4 cell counts >300 
cells/µL usually have manifestations, 
such as upper lobe cavitary infiltrates 
(274). Persons with HIV infection might also have pulmonary TB despite a 
normal chest radiograph (274,379).
 HIV-infected patients are also vulnerable to other pulmonary and systemic infections
such as 
Pneumocystis carinii and pneumococcal pneumonias and disseminated 
M. avium complex disease. Although the symptoms and signs of TB 
are  usually  different  to  the  trained  clinician  from  those  caused  by  other  prevalent
invasive pathogens 
(273,381), HIV co-infection often results in delay in the diagnosis of TB as a 
result of altered clinical and radiographic 
manifestations (23).
 Undetected transmission of 
M. tuberculosis to HIV-infected persons can have serious sequelae 
(136). A substantial outbreak of TB in a prison in South Carolina in 1999 
demonstrated the widespread consequences of an unrecognized 
TB case in a congregate setting with a substantial number of HIV-infected persons 
(37). In that outbreak, 32 TB cases and 96 tuberculin skin test conversions 
resulted from a single unrecognized case. Similar outbreaks have occurred in 
hospitals (53,244), HIV-living facilities and 
day-treatment programs (136), and homeless shelters 
(33).  Such  outbreaks  underscore  the  importance  of  aggressive  TB  screening  and
treatment in settings in which HIV-infected 
persons congregate. Screening for TB in those settings has been successfully conducted
by using symptom checklists, 
tuberculin skin testing, and chest radiographs 
(37,118,136).
 Case management. Management of TB among persons with HIV infection is complex.
Drugs used to treat TB 
and  those  employed  in  combination  antiretroviral  therapy  have  overlapping  toxicities
and potentially dangerous 
drug interactions (382). Paradoxical responses to TB therapy are more common among
HIV-infected persons 
(383). Use of multiple potentially toxic medications also provides further challenge to
adherence with TB treatment. 
Therefore,  integration  of  management  of  both  HIV  infection  and  TB  is  critical  to  the
success of management of 
both. Comprehensive case management, including DOT, is particularly important 
(5). Among HIV-infected TB patients, more favorable 
outcomes  and  survival  have  been  associated  with  DOT  than  with  self-administered
therapy 
(384).  ATS/CDC/IDSA  guidelines  should  be  consulted  for  recommendations  on  length
and mode of treatment and selection of 
drug 
regimens (5). Finally, patients with HIV and TB bear the brunt of two conditions that are
associated with clinical 
and social complexities that can be personally overwhelming. Both HIV infection and TB
are associated with 
stigmatization, and patients with these concomitant 
conditions often suffer from isolation and a lack of social 
support.
 Contact investigation. Despite controversy as to whether HIV-coinfected patients with
TB are more or less 
infectious than HIV-seronegative patients 
(385,386), they are clearly capable of transmitting 
M. tuberculosis; contacts of the two populations of patients have comparable rates of
LTBI 
(369,387). The higher risk for progressing rapidly from 
exposure  to  M.  tuberculosis  to  TB  disease  means  that  all  of  the  medical  and  public
health interventions (case detection 
and reporting, initiation of an effective drug regimen, and identification and evaluation
of contacts) are more urgent 
when working to control HIV-associated TB 
(388).
 Although offering HIV counseling and testing to all contacts of persons with infectious
TB has been 
recommended
 (302),
 this
 undertaking
 would
 be
 resource-intensive.
 Whereas
prevalence of HIV infection among contacts of 
HIV-infected persons is high, prevalence among contacts of persons with TB without HIV
infection or with 
undetermined status is negligible (301).
 Targeted testing and treatment of LTBI. HIV coinfection is the most important known
risk factor for persons 
with LTBI acquiring active TB (317,371,372). Treatment of LTBI is 
effective in reducing the risk for progression to 
TB disease among HIV coinfected persons 
(372,389). Thus, all possible efforts should be made to ensure that 
HIV-infected persons are tested for 
M.  tuberculosis  infection  and  that  those  found  to  have  latent  infection  receive  and
complete a 
course  of  treatment.  In  addition,  knowledge  of  the  HIV  status  of  persons  being
evaluated for LTBI is desirable 1) 
in interpreting the tuberculin skin test result (e.g., 
>5 mm of induration is considered a positive test among persons 
with HIV infection [4]) and 2) in counseling persons with positive skin test results about
the risks and benefits of 
treatment for LTBI (the role of QFT-G for testing persons with HIV infection for LTBI has
not been determined). According 
to current guidelines (302), persons being evaluated for LTBI should also be screened
for HIV infection by 
using self-reported clinical and behavioral risk factors.
 Institutional  infection  control.  Infection-control  measures  recommended  to  prevent
transmission of 
M. tuberculosis have been effective in limiting exposure of HIV-infected persons, 
including patients, visitors, and staff members, 
to M. tuberculosis in hospitals, extended care facilities, and correctional facilities 
(9,244). Nevertheless, the risk for rapid progression from exposure to TB disease means
that HIV-infected persons should continue to be advised of any 
potential sites of institutional exposure so an informed choice regarding employment or
volunteering can be made.
Control of TB Among Homeless Persons
 The persistence of TB among homeless persons in the United States is a major public
health problem. The 
homeless population is not insubstantial; in 1995, an estimated 5 million persons (2.5%
of adult 
U.S. residents) either were or had recently been homeless, living in streets or shelters,
or 
marginally housed (e.g., living on public support 
in  residential  hotels)  (390).  TB  incidence  is  high  among  homeless  persons,  and
evidence exists of considerable 
transmission  of  M.  tuberculosis.  Among  2,774  homeless  persons  enrolled  during
1990--1994 in San Francisco, California, 25 
incident cases were identified for 1992--1996, for an annual rate of 270 cases/100,00
population 
(118).  Among  20  M.  tuberculosis  isolates  from  incident  cases  that  were  subjected  to
genotyping study, 15 (75%) were 
clustered,  indicating  chains  of  transmission  in  the  population.  Other  molecular
epidemiology studies also have 
identified homelessness as an important risk factor for clustering of 
M. tuberculosis isolates 
(33,119,391,392).
 Shelters  are  key  sites  of  TB  transmission  among  homeless  persons  throughout  the
United States 
(27,33,118--120,166,  391--393).  In  Los  Angeles,  California  during  March  1994--May
1997, three homeless shelters were sites of 
TB transmission for 55 (70%) of 79 homeless patients 
(33). In Fort Worth, Texas during 1995--1996, clusters of 
cases among homeless persons occurred simultaneously in four homeless shelters 
(27). In Alabama, genotyping of isolates from TB cases 
reported in 1994-98 revealed an undetected statewide outbreak of TB that was traced
to transmission in 
a correctional facility and in two homeless shelters 
(166). In an outbreak in a shelter in Syracuse, New York, during 
1997--1998, a shelter resident was probably infectious for 10 months before receiving a
diagnosis; ventilation in the 
shelter was poor, and the population included vulnerable persons with risk factors that
included HIV infection, 
substance abuse, and malnutrition (120).
 Multiple barriers to the control of TB among homeless persons have been identified.
Delays in detection of 
infectious cases have been reported (20); in a computer simulation study that modeled
multiple strategies for TB control 
among  homeless  persons,  a  10%  improvement  in  access  to  treatment  led  to  greater
declines in disease and death after 10 
years than comparable improvements in treatment programs 
(394). Traditional methods of conducting contact 
investigations often fail to identify contacts of homeless persons with TB 
(30,119,120). Difficulties also have been encountered 
in completing treatment for homeless patients with active TB 
(395) and LTBI (167,184).
 
Basis for Recommendations for Control of TB Among Homeless Persons
 Surveillance  and  case  detection.  Delays  in  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  TB  among
homeless persons might occur as 
a result of delays in seeking medical care 
(181) and to the failure of medical providers to detect TB among those 
seeking  care  (20).  Homeless  persons  with  TB  are  disproportionately  likely  to  receive
care in hospital EDs and other urgent 
care  clinics  (232).  For  example,  during  1994--1996,  homeless  persons  in  Atlanta,
Georgia, were more likely than 
other patients to receive a diagnosis in a hospital ED 
(184). On the basis of sputum AFB smear results and 
radiologic  findings,  homeless  persons  had  more  advanced  disease  at  the  time  of
diagnosis, another indication that they 
received diagnoses later in the course of their disease 
(184).
 Shelters  have  proved  to  be  effective  sites  for  case  detection  by  use  of  screening
procedures among homeless 
persons.  During  May  1996--February  1997,  among  127 homeless  persons  in  Alabama
for whom shelter-based 
screening was conducted by using symptom evaluation, sputum culture, and chest 
radiographs as the screening package, four (3.1%) persons had TB disease 
(281). Symptom evaluation alone was not proven to be useful. In a similar study from
London, 
United Kingdom, that employed symptom evaluation, tuberculin skin testing, and chest
radiography, 1.5% of homeless persons 
were determined to have TB (396).
 On the basis of findings of a high prevalence of TB in 
shelter-using homeless populations, certain communities 
have  implemented  compulsory  screening  of  shelter  residents  based  on  symptom
evaluation or tuberculin skin testing 
with radiographs for those with positive tests. One such program in Portland, Oregon,
initiated in 1985, was associated 
with an 89% reduction in TB morbidity in the geographic area served by participating
shelters during 1980--1995 
(397). The implementation of a similar screening program in shelters in 
Denver, Colorado, in 1995 led to lower rates of 
active TB and reduced transmission of TB disease, as demonstrated by less genotype
clustering by DNA fingerprinting 
(167).  Both  screening  programs  were  based  on  symptom  evaluation,  tuberculin  skin
testing, and chest radiography. 
The decrease in TB morbidity in both these studies was attributed to shelter-based case
detection through screening activities.
 Case management. Completion of treatment for active TB is more difficult for homeless
persons, particularly 
those who report substance abuse, including alcohol abuse 
(395). Homeless persons with active TB are at high risk for 
poor adherence even with enhanced DOT and are more likely to default and move from
the area of initial diagnosis. They 
are also more likely to have legal action taken in the form of court-ordered treatment or
detention. Comprehensive 
case  management  that  includes  a  variety  of  incentives  and  enablers,  including  food,
temporary housing, 
transportation  vouchers,  and  treatment  for  substance  abuse  and  mental  illness  has
improved rates of treatment completion in 
this population.
 Costs for homeless persons who are hospitalized for initial treatment of active TB have
been $2,000 more than 
costs for persons who were not homeless 
(398). Excess hospital utilization could be attributable to social 
considerations,  clinical  indications  (especially  the  need  to  render  a  patient
noninfectious before discharge to a congregate living 
setting), or concerns about adherence to the plan of treatment. In San Diego, California,
a novel housing program that 
used hostels facilitated the completion of treatment of TB in homeless persons 
(399).  Completion  rates  of  84%--100%  were  achieved  for  persons  housed  at  a
designated hostel in 1995. Certain TB-control programs in cities with 
substantial homeless populations routinely provide temporary or longer-term housing in
attempts to 
improve completion of treatment. The California Department of Health allots funds for
temporary housing of persons with TB to each of 
its  county  and  local  jurisdictions.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban
Development also provides funding 
for housing patients with TB.
 The beneficial impact on treatment outcomes of an integrated approach to managing
homeless patients with TB 
has been emphasized (394). For example, a social care and health follow-up program
among homeless patients in Spain 
was  associated  with  a  decrease  in  TB  rates  from  32.4/100,000  in  1987  to  19.8
cases/100,000 in 1992, and 
better 
completion rates and reduced costs for hospitalizations were also 
documented (400). In Massachusetts, 58 (34.5%) 
of 214 persons hospitalized in a dedicated inpatient unit for difficult TB patients during
1990--1995 were 
homeless  (401).  Regardless  of  the  case-management  plan  that  is  chosen,  all  such
interventions should take into consideration 
the importance of addressing major gaps in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about TB
among homeless persons 
(181).
 Contact investigation. Contact investigations for cases of TB among homeless persons
are particularly 
challenging.  Homeless  patients  with  TB  often  fail  to  identify  contacts  during  routine
investigation 
(30). Completing a contact evaluation in identified contacts and completing treatment
for LTBI among contacts that are homeless are often 
difficult (320,391,402). Interpretation of the results of tuberculin skin testing of contacts
of homeless cases is 
problematic because the background prevalence of positive tuberculin skin tests in the
population is usually higher than that of 
the general population. As with contact investigations among other populations at high
risk, discerning when a 
contact  investigation  has  become  a  targeted  testing  program  is  often  difficult.  A
proposed alternative approach to 
conducting contact investigations of homeless persons is to focus on possible sites or
locations of exposure, such as 
shelters (391,393).
 Targeted testing for and treatment of LTBI. When homeless persons are identified as a
population at high risk on 
the  basis  of  the  local  epidemiology  of  TB,  targeted  testing  and  treatment  protocols
tailored to local circumstances should 
be  developed.  However,  low  rates  of  completion  of  therapy  for  LTBI  are  commonly
observed 
(167,184,402). For example, among 7,232 inner city residents (including homeless 
persons) screened for LTBI during 1994--1996 in 
Atlanta, Georgia, 4,701 (65%) completed tuberculin skin testing; of 809 (17%) who had
a positive test, 409 (50%) 
were candidates for isoniazid therapy, and 84 (20%) completed treatment 
(184). In another study conducted in San Francisco, California, during 1991--1994 that 
was designed to improve adherence, two novel interventions 
(biweekly preventive DOT with either a $5 incentive 
or a peer health adviser) were compared with the usual method of 
self-supervised treatment (402). Even though completion of treatment was not high for
any of the three groups, 
multivariate  analysis  indicated  that  independent  predictors  of  completion  were  being
offered the monetary incentive and residence 
in  a  hotel  or  other  stable  housing  at  entry  into  the  study.  That  report  confirmed  an
earlier finding that advocated 
offering monetary incentives (320).
 Institutional  and  environmental  controls.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  reduce
transmission of TB in shelters 
for homeless persons by enhancing institutional control measures. These efforts have
included reducing shelter size 
(13), improving ventilation systems, and using germicidal ultraviolet light 
(280).
Control of TB Among Detainees and Prisoners
 Correctional  facilities  in  the  United  States  include  jails  and  prisons,  which  serve
different but 
complementary functions. Jails serve as pretrial detention centers and house persons 
(detainees) awaiting trial and those sentenced to 
<1 year of incarceration. Local and county governments operate the majority of jails.
Jails are characterized by 
rapid  turnover  of  detainees  with  short  lengths  of  stay.  Prisons  serve  as  sites  of
detention for persons (prisoners) who have 
been sentenced and will be incarcerated for a known length of time, generally >1 year.
State governments, the 
federal  government,  and  the  military  all  operate  prison  systems.  On  any  given  day,
approximately 2 million persons in 
the  United  States  are  incarcerated;  1.4  million  of  those  are  imprisoned,  and  the
remainder are detained in 
jails. Approximately 6 million persons are incarcerated 
in jails or prisons each year for variable lengths of time 
(124,125).
 Detainees  and  prisoners  represent  the  poorest  and  most  medically  underserved
segments of the U.S. population, 
the same population segments at risk for LTBI and TB disease 
(124,252,253). Persons entering prisons have usually 
spent  time  in  jail,  and  detainees  and  prisoners  eventually  reenter  the  community.
Consequently, TB outbreaks 
among  detainees,  prisoners,  and  the  general  population  of  a  geographic  area  are
interrelated 
(127,403),  and  close  coordination  of  TB-control  activities  is  needed  between  health
programs in correctional facilities and jurisdictional public 
health agencies.
 Prisons have long been identified as sites of transmission of 
M. tuberculosis to other inmates and workers 
(38,139,404--408), including those with HIV infection 
(38,139,405,408). In addition, time spent in jail is a risk factor 
for subsequent acquisition of TB 
(127,250,256), an indication that jails often 
are also sites of transmission. Correctional facilities are among the most important sites
of transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in the United States.
 Failure to detect TB in correctional facilities results in TB outbreaks, which have been
well documented 
(37,139,404--408).  Outbreaks  of  multidrug-resistant  TB  involving  inmates  and  staff,
including HIV-infected persons, were 
a prominent component of the 1985--1992 TB resurgence in the United States 
(404,405,409--411). However, outbreaks have continued to occur 
(37,139), even though TB control, including control of 
M. tuberculosis transmission, in the United States has improved.
 
Basis for Recommendations on Control of TB Among Detainees and Prisoners
 Case detection and case management. Despite the 
importance of jails and prisons in sustaining and amplifying 
the reservoir of TB in the United States 
(127,405,407), little is known about the optimal means of case detection of 
TB  among  detainees  and  prisoners.  The  majority  of  prisons  have  adopted  a
case-detection strategy that is based on a 
survey of TB symptoms obtained on admission, in which all entrants are tested for 
M. tuberculosis infection <14 days 
of admission; universal chest radiographs of all entrants are rarely offered 
(410). No data have been published 
supporting the effectiveness of symptom surveys and testing for 
M. tuberculosis infection for detecting cases of TB and 
preventing  transmission  within  jail  systems,  although  screening  by  tuberculin  skin
testing was effective in controlling TB in 
one prison system (411). Certain substantial urban jails perform chest radiographs on
all persons entering the institution 
in an attempt to minimize transmission of TB 
(283,412), and data indicate that this approach 
is cost effective (412). Because nearly all prison 
entrants have first been detained in a jail system, effective TB case-detection programs
in 
jails will substantially decrease the probability that persons with undetected active TB
will be admitted to prison.
 Once cases are detected, strategies similar to those used in the community have led to
high rates of 
successful treatment completion (413). A particular problem for case management in a
jail setting is the unanticipated release 
of  detainees,  which  often  precludes  the  development  of  an  effective  discharge  plan.
Strategies to better 
coordinate discharges with public health authorities should be promoted.
 Contact investigation. Continuing outbreaks of TB in correctional facilities 
(37,139) underscore the importance of prompt and thorough contact investigations in
jails and prisons. Contact investigations in correctional 
facilities involve two steps: 1) identifying and evaluating persons exposed 
before  the  source-case  was  incarcerated,  and  2)  identifying  and  evaluating  persons
exposed during incarceration of the source-case. Effective case detection is important 
to limit the size of the latter group. Contact investigations 
often need to be conducted broadly, among more than one 
facility, because of the movement of detainees within the correctional system 
(414).
 Conducting contact investigations based on the concentric 
circle method is difficult in correctional 
institutions.  Frequently,  a  single  infected  person  can  expose  up  to  several  hundred
persons both before and after incarceration. 
Cases involving persons who were exposed before incarceration should be managed by
the jurisdictional public health 
agency for the community in which the person lived before arrest. For the jurisdictional
public health agency to carry out 
those contact investigations effectively, prompt notification and case reporting by the
detention facility is necessary. 
Guidelines for conducting contact investigations in jails have been published 
(258).
 Targeted testing and treatment of LTBI. Targeted testing and treatment of latent TB
among detainees and 
prisoners has been described in detail 
(415--417). Because of the high risk for transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  in  correctional  facilities,  inmates  incarcerated  for  >14  days  usually
receive a test for 
M. tuberculosis infection as part of TB case 
detection. Detainees and prisoners with LTBI often are considered to be candidates for
treatment of latent TB 
(124,252,253). Prisons often are an ideal setting for effective treatment of LTBI 
because of known location of the patient, length of 
stay,  prohibition  of  illicit  drugs  and  alcohol,  and  a  predictable  diet.  Nevertheless,
achieving high rates of completion 
of treatment for LTBI in prisons or jails has been difficult 
(257,416,417).
 The majority of jail detainees are released in 
<14 days of entry. If treatment for LTBI is started in the jail 
setting,  community  follow-up  after  release  from  jail  is  essential.  Without  specific
interventions to assure such follow-up, 
the probability of completion of treatment might be <10% 
(256,257,418). Recent developments in short-course 
treatment of latent TB with a combination of rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 months
offered promise in improving 
treatment completion rates (419). However, the toxicity of this regimen precludes its
routine use 
(324), and this combination should generally not be used for the treatment of LTBI in
correctional settings because the rates of toxicity have 
been  similar  to  those  observed  in  the  wider  community.  In  addition,  detainees  and
prisoners have high rates of hepatitis 
C infection, making them especially prone to serious hepatotoxicity.
 Institutional  infection  control.  Correctional  institutions  have  been  sites  of  virulent
outbreaks of TB, 
including multidrug-resistant TB, that have involved HIV-infected 
inmates and staff (37,139,405,408). Common findings 
in these outbreaks have included the failure to isolate persons with active TB quickly.
Another common finding has 
been disease associated with rapid transmission of 
M. tuberculosis when immunosuppressed detainees and prisoners are 
housed together. An effective infection-control program can decrease the likelihood of
TB transmission in 
correctional  institutions  (420).  Guidelines  to  assist  correctional  institutions  in
developing effective infection-control programs 
have been published (258).
Control of TB in Health-Care Facilities and Other High-Risk Environments
 During  the  1985--1992  TB  resurgence  in  the  United  States,  TB  cases  resulted  from
transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in settings where patients with infectious TB congregated closely with
susceptible persons 
(52--54,170,421).  This  epidemiologic  disease  pattern  had  not  been  recognized  in  the
United States since the development of effective 
drugs against TB starting in the 1950s. Hospitals and other health-care facilities were
the primary, but not the only, sites 
of transmission (405,406,408), and HIV-infected persons were prominent among those
who contracted 
M. tuberculosis infection and rapidly acquired TB disease 
(52--54,170,406,408). Although incidence of TB in health-care facilities 
has been markedly reduced because of the development and deployment of 
effective infection-control measures 
(56,422--424) and decreasing incidence of TB in different communities, TB disease 
attributable to recent transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in other settings has not only persisted but has been recognized in a
wide variety of sites and settings 
and become an established epidemiologic pattern.
 As a consequence of the changed epidemiology of TB in the United States, the primary
strategies now required 
to control the disease include measures for its prevention in settings in which a risk for
transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  exists  (Box  4).  Recommendations  for  infection-control  measures  in
high-risk settings are provided in this statement. 
The  approach  to  control  of  TB  and  other  airborne  infections  that  was  developed  for
health-care facilities 
(10)  is  the  most  successful  model  and  is  outlined  in  detail  in  this  statement.
Recommendations are also provided for control 
of  transmission  of  M.  tuberculosis  in  extended  care  facilities,  correctional  facilities,
homeless 
shelters and other high-risk settings.
Control of TB in Health-Care Facilities
 Strategies for control of TB in health-care facilities, which also are applicable for other
settings in which 
high-risk persons congregate, are based on comprehensive guidelines 
issued by CDC in 1994 (10). New CDC guidelines 
for preventing transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in health-care facilities will be published in 2005. A 
draft† of these guidelines has been published in the Federal Register. In the assessment
of institutional risk for TB, three levels of risk 
(low,  medium,  and  potential  ongoing  transmission)  are  recommended,  based  on  the
recent experience with TB in 
the institution and in the community it serves. The recommended frequency of testing
of employees for 
M.  tuberculosis  infection  varies,  depending  on  the  institution's  level  of  risk.  The
tuberculin skin test is recommended for testing 
HCWs and other employees with a risk for exposure to 
M. tuberculosis. QFT-G is also approved for detecting LTBI; 
guidelines for the use of QFT-G will be published in the 
MMWR.
 The risk for TB associated with health-care facilities is related to the incidence of TB in
the community served by 
the facility and to the efficacy of infection-control measures 
(422). Implementation of infection-control guidelines 
(10) has markedly reduced risk for exposure to TB in health-care facilities during the
past decade 
(56,422--424)  and  has  also  contributed  to  the  decreasing  numbers  of  TB  cases.
Implementation of effective infection-control measures in the 
medical workplace is thus an important element of broader national and international 
strategies to prevent transmission of TB 
(244).
 Epidemiologic  investigations  of  the  early  outbreaks  of  TB  in  health-care  facilities,
including those involving 
multidrug-resistant  cases,  indicated  that  transmission  usually  occurred  because  of
failure to identify and isolate patients 
with infectious forms of TB. In certain instances, diagnosis of TB was delayed as a result
of the atypical presentation of 
TB  among  patients  with  HIV  infection,  especially  those  with  low  CD4  counts.
Transmission was also facilitated by 1) 
the  intermingling  of  patients  with  undiagnosed  TB  with  patients  who  were  highly
susceptible; 2) inadequate 
laboratory 
facilities or delayed laboratory reporting; and 3) delayed institution of effective therapy.
Other factors 
facilitating  transmission  included  a  lack  of  negative  pressure  respiratory  isolation
rooms, recirculation of air from 
respiratory isolation rooms to other parts of the hospital, failure to isolate patients until
they were no longer infectious, 
allowing isolated patients to leave their rooms without wearing a mask, and leaving 
respiratory isolation room doors open 
(52--54,170,421,425,426).
 CDC guidelines recommend a hierarchy of TB infection-control measures 
(10). In order of importance, these 
measures  are  administrative  controls,  engineering  controls,  and  personal  respiratory
protection (PRP) 
(Box 7). Administrative controls consist of measures to reduce the risk for exposure to
persons with infectious TB, including screening of 
patients  for  symptoms  and  signs  of  TB  at  the  time  of  admission,  isolating  those  with
suspected disease, establishing a 
diagnosis, and promptly initiating standard therapy 
(5). Engineering control measures are designed to reduce dissemination 
of droplet nuclei containing 
M. tuberculosis from infectious patients and include the use of airborne infection 
isolation rooms. The third level (and the lowest on the hierarchy of controls) is the use
of PRP devices such as N-95 
respirators. Respirator usage for the prevention of TB is regulated by the Occupational
and Health Safety Administration under 
the general industry standard for respiratory 
protection§.
 In implementing a comprehensive infection control program for TB, institutions should
first conduct a risk 
assessment to determine what measures are applicable. Risk for transmission of 
M. tuberculosis varies widely, and procedures that 
are  appropriate  for  an  institution  in  an  area  of  high  TB  incidence  (e.g.,  an  inner-city
hospital or homeless shelter in 
a  metropolitan  high-incidence  area)  differ  from  those  applicable  to  an  institution
located in a low incidence area that 
is rarely used by patients with TB. The jurisdictional public health TB-control program
should assist in 
the development of the assessment, which should include data on the epidemiology of
TB in the community served by 
the institution and the number of TB patients receiving evaluation and care.
 The institutional risk for TB can be stratified according to the size of the institution and
the number of patients 
with TB as low risk, medium risk, or potential ongoing transmission. Hospitals with 
>200 beds that provided care for fewer than six patients with TB during the previous
year are categorized as low risk whereas those that cared for six or 
more patients are categorized as medium risk. For hospitals with <200 beds, those with
fewer than three TB patients in 
the  previous  year  are  considered  low  risk,  and  those  with  three  or  more  cases  are
considered medium risk. Outpatient 
clinics, outreach programs, or home health settings 
that provide care for fewer than three patients with TB per year 
are considered low risk, and those that care for three or more patients are considered
medium risk. TB clinics, 
outreach programs, and other settings in which HCWs are responsible for the care of
persons with TB are classified as 
medium risk. Any institution, clinic, or setting with evidence of recent patient-to-patient
or 
patient-to-employee transmission of 
M. tuberculosis or of ongoing or unresolved transmission should be classified as having
potential ongoing 
transmission until effective control measures have been implemented and transmission
is interrupted. Potential ongoing 
transmission is a temporary classification.
 When transmission of 
M.  tuberculosis  is  suspected  at  a  facility,  an  immediate  investigation  should  be
undertaken 
that includes consultation with public health officials or experts in hospital epidemiology
and infection control. Evidence 
of potential transmission of 
M. tuberculosis includes clusters of conversions of tests for 
M. tuberculosis infection among employees 
from negative to positive, increased rates of positive tests for 
M. tuberculosis infection among employees, 
an  employee  with  potentially  infectious  TB,  unrecognized  TB  among  patients  or
employees, and recognition of 
identical strains on genotyping of 
M. tuberculosis isolates from patients or employees.
 How often employees at health-care facilities and other 
at-risk sites for M. tuberculosis infection are tested depends 
on the risk assessment. The positive predictive value of the tuberculin skin test is low
when populations with a 
low prevalence of infection with 
M. tuberculosis are tested 
(424,427). Consequently, frequent testing by using that method 
in low-incidence, low-risk settings is discouraged. In addition, false-positive tests have
been reported when 
institutions changed brands of Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) 
reagent, for example from 
Tubersol® to 
Aplisol® (427).
 At the time of employment, all HCWs should undergo baseline testing (with two-step
testing if the tuberculin 
skin test is used and no testing was performed during the preceding year) 
(10). Those in medium-risk settings should 
be tested annually. Follow-up testing is recommended for workers in low-risk settings
only if exposure to a patient 
with infectious TB (i.e., a patient not initially isolated but later found to have laryngeal
or pulmonary TB) has 
occurred. 
Institutions in which ongoing transmission of 
M. tuberculosis is documented should carry out testing for 
M. tuberculosis infection of HCWs at risk every 3 months until transmission has been
terminated.
 Employees testing positive for 
M. tuberculosis infection should receive a chest radiograph to exclude TB disease 
and should be evaluated for the treatment of LTBI based on current recommendations 
(4,324).  Compliance  with  therapy  for  LTBI  among  HCWs,  including  clinicians,  has
historically been poor 
(428--430). Employee health clinics and 
infection-control departments should emphasize to HCWs the importance of completion
of therapy for LTBI. In a 
comprehensive infection-control program that encourages HCWs to complete treatment
for LTBI, higher completion rates have 
been reported (431,432).
 
Control of Transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in Other High-Risk Settings
 Extended Care facilities. Elderly persons residing in a nursing home are almost twice as
likely to acquire TB as 
those living in the community (252,433,434). Certain considerations for control of TB in
hospitals apply also 
to  extended  care  facilities,  including  1)  maintaining  a  high  index  of  suspicion  for  the
disease; 2) promptly detecting 
cases  and  diagnosing  disease;  3)  isolating  infectious  persons  and  initiating  standard
therapy; 4) identifying and 
evaluating  contacts;  and  5)  conducting  contact  investigations  when  indicated.  The
value of treating LTBI in elderly residents 
of nursing homes so as to prevent future outbreaks has been documented 
(435).
 In 1990, CDC published recommendations for TB control in extended care facilities 
(433).  Those  long-term  care  facilities  that  do  not  have  airborne-infection-isolation
rooms should transfer patients suspected to have infectious TB 
to other facilities (including acute-care hospitals) until the disease is ruled in or out and
treatment is started if 
indicated and continued until the patient is noninfectious 
(10). The risk assessment and frequency of testing for LTBI 
for  employees  at  long-term  care  facilities  are  similar  to  those  described  previously.
Residents should be tested on 
admission to the facility and should provide a history and undergo physical examination
to identify symptoms and signs of 
TB. Residents with LTBI should be offered treatment according to current 
recommendations (4,324), with careful monitoring for drug toxicity.
 Correctional  facilities.  Common  findings  in  outbreaks  of  TB  in  correctional  facilities
were the failure to recognize 
and
 isolate
 patients
 with
 TB
 and
 rapid
 progression
 of
 outbreaks
 when
immunosuppressed detainees were housed 
together  (405,406,408).  Because  of  the  substantial  numbers  of  cases  of  TB  infection
and disease that might result from 
outbreaks  at  correctional  facilities  and  the  natural  movement  of  inmates  from
incarceration to the general population, 
correctional  facilities  should  be  viewed  as  being  among  the  most  important  sites  of
transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in the United States 
(128,436).
 Guidelines for control of TB transmission in correctional facilities 
(123) have emphasized that the 
infection-control principles developed for health-care facilities 
(10) are also applicable to correctional facilities. In prisons and jails, 
the most important activity in TB infection control is efficient detection of infectious TB
cases, including those that 
are prevalent among persons entering the facility and those that arise during detention.
A prompt diagnostic 
evaluation,
 respiratory
 isolation
 (including
 transfer
 out
 of
 the
 facility
 if
airborne-infection-isolation rooms are not available), 
and institution of a standard treatment regimen are urgent priorities when suspected
cases are encountered. If this process 
is  delayed,  a  substantial  number  of  persons  might  be  exposed  as  a  result  of  the
congregate living arrangements 
that characterize correctional facilities.
 Because of crowded conditions that favor the spread of 
M. tuberculosis (420) and the high prevalence of 
HIV  infection  among  prisoners  (255),  contact  investigations  should  be  undertaken
immediately once a case of TB 
has  occurred  at  a  facility.  In  a  study  conducted  in  the  Maryland  state  correctional
system, prisons that conducted 
programs for targeted testing and treatment of LTBI among inmates experienced lower
rates of tuberculin skin test conversions, 
an indication that this measure can contribute to successful infection control 
(420). A template is now available to 
assist jails in instituting an effective 
infection-control program (258).
 Shelters  for  homeless  persons.  As  with  correctional  facilities,  homeless  shelters  are
important sites of transmission 
of M. tuberculosis and an important cause of the continuing high incidence of TB among
the homeless 
population (33,118). Effective infection-control strategies in those venues are use of 
M.  tuberculosis  genotyping  for  rapid  identification  of  clustered  cases  and  sites  of
transmission 
(27,33), screening shelter users for TB disease, 
wide-ranging  contact  investigations,  and  engineering  controls,  including  ultraviolet
germicidal irradiation 
(437). A systematic shelter-
based  program  for  targeted  testing  and  treatment  of  LTBI  in  Denver  was  also
demonstrated to decrease incidence of 
TB in the homeless population (167).
 Because crowding and poor ventilation are often prevalent in shelters, infection-control
efforts should also 
include engineering modifications to decrease exposure to 
M. tuberculosis. A guide to assist shelters in improving the safety 
of  their  environment  through  modifications  in  ventilation,  air  filtration,  and  the
introduction of ultraviolet 
germicidal irradiation has been published 
(438).
 Other high-risk settings. As the incidence of TB has 
receded in recent years, new patterns of transmission 
have  become  evident.  Epidemiologic  investigations  prompted  by  an  increase  in  the
incidence in TB in a community or 
state or by the identification of clusters of cases with identical 
M. tuberculosis genotype patterns have detected transmission 
in such venues as crack houses (137) and bars 
(27). In addition, transmission has been identified in association with 
certain  social  activities  that  are  not  typically  considered  in  routine  contact
investigations; a church choir 
(140), a floating card game (172), exotic dancers and their contacts 
(38), a transgender social network 
(34), and persons who drink together in multiple drinking establishments 
(439).
 Although special techniques have been developed for 
exploring chains of transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in complex social networks 
(439), transmission of 
M. tuberculosis in such settings is not amenable to prevention by 
available infection-control strategies. These newly identified patterns of transmission of 
M. tuberculosis might be too complex to 
be detected and controlled by traditional approaches, and real-time 
M. tuberculosis genotyping capable of 
identifying unsuspected linkages among incident cases might be increasingly useful 
(131).
 This  new  TB  threat,  transmission  in  previously  unknown  settings,  has  emerged  at  a
time when local 
TB-control programs often are not prepared to respond. As TB morbidity decreases in
the United States and TB-control 
programs
 necessarily
 contract,
 new
 approaches
 will
 emerge,
 particularly
 in
low-incidence areas. One model envisions that 
local public HCWs who do not work exclusively on TB are served by 
regional TB supervisors, who in turn are supported 
by statewide consultants and CDC specialists 
(172).
Research Needs to Enhance TB Control
 Implementation of the recommendations contained in this statement will likely improve
TB control and 
allow  progress  to  be  made  toward  eliminating  TB  in  the  United  States.  However,
achieving TB elimination as defined 
by ACET (i.e., one annual case of TB per one million population 
[11]) will require substantial advancements in 
the  technology  of  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  prevention  of  the  disease.  IOM  has
estimated that at the current rate of 
decline, approximately 6% annually, eliminating TB in the United States would take >70
years 
(2).  New  tools  are  needed  for  the  diagnosis,  treatment,  and  prevention  of  TB  to
accelerate the decline in TB incidence and reach the elimination 
threshold sooner (1,2,45). In addition, improved tests for the diagnosis of TB and LTBI
and more effective drugs to treat them 
are needed to reduce the substantial worldwide burden of disease and death resulting
from TB 
(44).
 AFB smear microscopy and the tuberculin skin test, the most commonly used tests for
the diagnosis of TB 
and  latent  infection  respectively,  derive  from  technology  developed  in  the  19th
Century; the only available vaccine 
against  TB,  BCG,  dates  from  the  early  20th  Century;  and  rifampin,  the  most  recent
novel compound for treatment of TB, 
was  introduced  in  1963.  In  the  long  term,  the  development  of  a  new  and  effective
vaccine would have the greatest impact 
on  the  global  epidemic  of  TB,  and  the  United  States  should  lead  the  research  and
advocacy efforts to develop such a 
vaccine  (180,440).  However,  other  advances  in  TB  diagnosis  and  treatment  might
substantially improve the control of TB in 
the United States. Better means to diagnose and treat LTBI are needed immediately.
Breakthrough diagnostics and 
drugs that would facilitate the more effective usage 
of this therapeutic intervention to prevent TB would have an 
immediate  and  lasting  effect  on  the  incidence  of  the  disease  in  the  United  States  by
affecting at least three of the major challenges 
to TB control in the United States: the substantial pool of persons with LTBI, TB among 
foreign-born persons, and TB among contacts of persons with infectious TB (Box 1).
 Public health interventions to control TB should be based on practices that have been
demonstrated to be 
effective.  Because  an  established  scientific  basis  is  lacking  for  certain  fundamental
principles of TB control, including 
certain  recommendations  contained  in  this  statement,  logic,  experience,  and  expert
opinion have been used to guide clinical 
and public health practice to control TB. In the preparation of these recommendations
for TB control, deficiencies 
in 
evidence  were  frequently  noted.  Better  understanding  is  needed  of  which  persons
among the millions of 
foreign-born persons that enter the United States each year (Table 8) are at sufficient
additional risk for TB to warrant public 
health  intervention.  The  approaches  recommended  for  the  development  of  programs
for targeted testing of LTBI 
need additional verification. The new concepts of identifying contacts of infectious TB
cases 
(439) require refinement. The optimal method of reducing the concentration of 
M. tuberculosis in ambient air in venues such as homeless shelters is 
not  yet  defined  (438).  Methods  to  monitor  and  evaluate  TB  control  programs,  and  in
particular, new activities 
such outbreak surveillance and response 
(441), should be delineated and standardized.
 The epidemiology of TB in the United States is constantly changing. Recent examples,
as noted throughout 
this  statement,  are  the  increase  in  TB  among  foreign-born  persons,  the  upsurge  in
reports of TB outbreaks, and the 
persistent  high  incidence  of  the  disease  among  U.S.-born  non-Hispanic  blacks.
Epidemiologic studies, including 
economic  analyses,  are  needed  to  augment  surveillance  data  and  facilitate  decisions
about allocation of effort and resources 
to address newly identified facets of the epidemiology of TB.
 As new diagnostics are introduced to TB control, operational, economic, and behavioral
studies will be needed 
to determine their most effective use. For example, QFT, a new diagnostic test for LTBI,
was licensed in 2001, and 
early research indicated that this new test might have advantages over the tuberculin
skin test in distinguishing 
between
 latent
 M.
 tuberculosis
 infection
 and
 infection
 with
 nontuberculous
mycobacteria or vaccination with BCG 
(102).  However,  guidelines  on  testing  for  LTBI  recommended  that  QFT  should  not  be
used in the evaluation of contacts of 
infectious cases of TB, for children aged <17 years, for pregnant women, or for patients
with immunocompromising 
conditions,  including  HIV  infection,  because  of  a  lack  of  data  from  studies  in  those
populations 
(103). A newer version of the test, QFT-G, was 
licensed  in  2004.  The  role  of  this  new  test  in  these  populations  has  not  been
determined 
Thus, considerable research remains to be done to delineate the advantages this new
test can bring to TB control.
 Despite  the  best  efforts  of  national,  state,  and  local  TB  programs,  nonadherence  to
prescribed treatment for TB 
and  latent  infection  remains  a  major  barrier  to  TB  elimination.  As  evidence  of  the
importance of that 
intervention,  completion  of  a  course  of  treatment  is  the  first  national  performance
standard for TB (Table 4). For the outcome of 
TB treatment to be improved, both patient and health-care provider behaviors related
to adherence to TB treatment 
must be understood, and that understanding should be used to design and implement
methods for improving 
adherence.  Although  considerable  research  has  been  conducted  in  this  field,  no
comprehensive effort has been undertaken 
to  examine  and  compile  the  results  and  identify  best  practices.  Gaps  in  knowledge
remain, and the need exists to 
develop  and  implement  a  comprehensive  behavioral  and  social  science  research
agenda to address these deficiencies.
