home or at another location for the duration of illness, but that might not be possible in
all  situations.  Prioritizing  isolation  and  infection  control  strategies  helps  prevent
transmission  while  balancing  the  impact  of  this  infection  on  the  daily  lives  of  people
diagnosed  with  mpox.  These  considerations  may  change  as  we  learn  more  from  the
2022  global  outbreak  of  mpox.  The  following  principles  should  be  considered  and
adopted to the extent possible in the home setting. The CDC provides general guidance
on cleaning and disinfecting non-healthcare settings, such as homes or cars, where an
individual  with  mpox  spent  significant  time  (see:  Disinfecting  Home  and  Other
Non-Healthcare Settings).
