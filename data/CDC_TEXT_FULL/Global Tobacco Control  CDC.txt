and disease worldwide. Currently, it is estimated that nearly 8 million people die each
year due to tobacco-related illnesses, which costs the global economy US $1.4 trillion
annually.1 An efficient and systematic surveillance mechanism to monitor the epidemic
is one of the essential components of a comprehensive tobacco control program. CDC is
the  lead  US  federal  agency  for  comprehensive  tobacco  prevention  and  control,  and
CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health develops, conducts, and supports strategic efforts
to protect the public’s health from the harmful effects of tobacco use. CDC is a WHO
Collaborating Center for Global Tobacco Surveillance and the technical agency for the
Global Tobacco Surveillance System (GTSS).CDC’s global tobacco work is supported by
the  CDC  Foundation  through  donations  from  the  Bloomberg  Initiative  to  Reduce
Tobacco  Use  and  The  Bill  and  Melinda  Gates  Foundation.  The  Global  Tobacco
Surveillance  System  Data  (GTSSData)  is  a  Web-based  application  that  houses  and
displays data from four tobacco-related surveys conducted around the world. The GTSS
consist  of  four  surveys:  The  GATS  Atlas  presents  tobacco  statistics  from  22  GATS
countries  in  a  visual  format—using  data  that  cover  nearly  60  percent  of  the  world’s
population.It  serves  as  a  resource  for  decision  makers,  public  health  professionals,
advocates,  researchers,  and  media  as  they  work  to  advance  social  policies.  Survey
