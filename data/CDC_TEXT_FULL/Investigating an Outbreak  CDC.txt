variety of strategies and studies to try to identify the source of an outbreak and what
works to control it. Because every scenario is different, it is important for them to think
critically about how to interpret and use results to solve the problem. In this section,
students  use  research,  engineering,  and  communication  strategies  to  respond  to
outbreak scenarios like a disease detective. Students will learn how to: For background
