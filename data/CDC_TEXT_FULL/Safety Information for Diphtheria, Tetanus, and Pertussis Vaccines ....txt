bacterial diseases that can be prevented through vaccination. Diphtheria can cause a
thick  membrane-like  covering  in  the  back  of  the  throat.  It  can  lead  to  breathing
problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death. The bacteria can spread from person
to person by coughing, sneezing, or touching infected open sores or ulcers. Learn more
about  diphtheria.  Tetanus  (also  known  as  lockjaw)  is  a  serious  disease  that  causes
painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to “locking” of
the jaw, preventing a person from opening their mouth or swallowing. Tetanus leads to
death in about 1 in 10 cases. The bacteria that cause tetanus is not spread from person
to  person.  Instead,  it  is  found  in  soil,  dust,  and  manure  (feces)  and  can  get  into  the
body  through  open  wounds.  Learn  more  about  tetanus.  Pertussis  (also  known  as
whooping cough) is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection. Although it initially
resembles an ordinary cold, whooping cough can become more serious, particularly in
infants.  The  bacteria  can  spread  from  person  to  person  by  coughing,  sneezing,  or
sharing  the  same  breathing  space  for  an  extended  period  of  time.  Learn  more  about
pertussis. Vaccines are available that can help prevent these diseases. All infants and
children,  adolescents,  and  adults  should  get  vaccinated.  CDC  recommends:  Vaccine
Information  Statements  (VISs)  are  information  sheets  produced  by  CDC  that  explain
both the benefits and risks of a vaccine.  There are several different types of vaccines
that  can  safely  help  prevent  diphtheria,  tetanus,  and  pertussis:  Child  and  Adult

effective at preventing diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Vaccines, like any medicine,
can have side effects. The most common side effects are usually mild and go away on
their  own.   Severe  allergic  reactions  following  vaccination  are  rare,  but  can  be  life
threatening. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include hives, swelling of the
face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. If such
reactions  occur,  call  9-1-1  and  get  the  person  to  the  nearest  hospital.  I  am  raw  html

mild to moderate and can last from 1 to 3 days. Who Should Not Get DTaP Vaccine 
DTaP  is  not  for  children  ages  7  years  and  older.  A  person  who  has  ever  had  a
life-threatening  allergic  reaction  after  a  previous  dose  of  a  diphtheria,  tetanus,  or
pertussis containing vaccine, or has a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, should
not get a DTaP vaccine. Anyone who has been in a coma or had long, repeated seizures
within  7  days  of  administration  of  a  previous  dose  of  any  pertussis  vaccine.  Parents
should talk to their child’s healthcare provider before getting the DTaP vaccine if their
child: In some cases, the healthcare provider may decide to postpone the child’s DTaP
vaccination to a future visit. Children who are moderately or severely ill with or without
fever should usually wait until they recover before getting the DTaP vaccine. Common
Side  Effects  Who  Should  Not  Get  Tdap  Vaccine  A  person  who  has  ever  had  a
life-threatening  allergic  reaction  after  a  previous  dose  of  diphtheria,  tetanus  or
pertussis containing vaccine, or has a severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, should
not  get  Tdap  vaccine.  Anyone  who  has  been  in  a  coma  or  has  had  long,  repeated
seizures  within  7  days  after  any  pertussis  vaccine,  unless  a  cause  other  than  the
vaccine  was  found.  They  can  still  get  a  Td  vaccine.  A  person  should  talk  with  their
healthcare provider before getting the Tdap vaccine if they: Common Side Effects Who
Should Not Get Td Vaccine A person who has ever had a severe allergic reaction after a
previous  dose  of  any  tetanus  or  diphtheria  containing  vaccine  should  not  get  a  Td
vaccine. People should talk to their healthcare provider before getting the Td vaccine if
they:  Seizures caused by fever are called “febrile seizures.” When they occur in young
children,  these  seizures  are  frightening  for  parents.  However,  most  children  recover
from them quickly and have no long-lasting effects. Learn more about febrile seizures.
Which  adverse  events  are  considered  “serious?”  By  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations
(CFR)  Title  21,  an  adverse  event  is  defined  as  serious  if  it  involves  any  of  the
following  outcomes:  Learn  more  about  adverse  events.   CDC  and  FDA  monitor  the
safety of vaccines after they are approved or authorized. If a problem is found with a
vaccine, CDC and FDA will inform health officials, health care providers, and the public.
