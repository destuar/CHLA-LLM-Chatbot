regarding the modestly increased risk
for meningococcal disease among college freshmen, particularly those who live
in dormitories or residence halls. It presents recommendations developed by

of students and parents about meningococcal disease and the
polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine so that they can make informed decisions
regarding vaccination.
INTRODUCTION
Neisseria meningitidis causes both sporadic disease and outbreaks. As a result
of the control of Haemophilus influenzae type b infections,
N.  meningitidis  has  become  the  leading  cause  of  bacterial  meningitis  in  children  and
young adults in the
United States (1).  Outbreaks of meningococcal disease were rare in the United States
in
the 1980s; however, since 1991, the frequency of localized outbreaks has increased
(2).  From July 1994 through July 1997, 42 meningococcal outbreaks were reported, four
of which occurred at colleges (3).  However, outbreaks continue to represent <3% of
total U.S. cases (3).
Rates of meningococcal disease remain highest for infants, but in the past
decade, rates have increased among adolescents and young adults
(4).  During 1994--1998, approximately two thirds of cases among persons aged 18--23
years were caused
by serogroups C, Y, or W135 and therefore were potentially preventable with
available vaccines (5) (CDC, unpublished data) (Figure 1).  Although the quadrivalent
meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is safe and efficacious
(5,6), decisions about who to target for vaccination require understanding of the groups
at risk, the burden of
disease, and the potential benefits of vaccination.
New data are available regarding the risk for meningococcal disease in college
students.  This report reviews these data and provides medical professionals with
guidelines concerning meningococcal disease and college students.
BACKGROUND
Meningococcal Disease in the Military
Military recruits and college freshmen have several common characteristics
(e.g., age, diverse geographic backgrounds, and crowded living conditions). Therefore,
data obtained from recruits have been used to evaluate meningococcal disease and
vaccine among college freshmen.
Before 1971, rates of meningococcal disease were elevated among U.S.
military recruits. Outbreaks frequently followed large-scale mobilizations, and recruits in
their initial training camps were at substantially greater risk for disease than were
regular troops (7).  Military recruits enter military service for the first time at a few large
U.S. military recruit training centers.  After 8--12 weeks of initial training, they disperse
to perform their military service at many different locations.  During mobilization for
the Vietnam conflict, outbreaks of meningococcal disease at training camps involving
substantial numbers of recruits were caused by sulfadiazine-resistant strains of
N. meningitidis.  During 1964--1970, the rate of hospitalizations resulting from
meningococcal disease among all active duty service members was 25.2 per 100,000
person- years (LTC Frederick Erdtmann, MD, MPH, Office of the Surgeon General, U.S.
Army, briefing, 1981).  These circumstances led to development of meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines (8). Field trials of group C polysaccharide vaccine among U.S.
Army recruits demonstrated an 89.5% reduction in the rate of serogroup C
meningococcal disease among vaccinated versus nonvaccinated recruits
(9,10); thus, beginning in October 1971, all new recruits were vaccinated with the group
C vaccine
(11),  and  by  Fall  1982,  all  recruits  were  receiving  the  quadrivalent  polysaccharide
vaccine
(7).  However, rates of meningococcal disease in U.S. Army personnel declined before
the
1971 vaccination campaigns (7), suggesting that smaller recruit populations at training
installations and the natural periodicity of outbreaks may have contributed to the
decline in disease.
Rates of meningococcal disease remain low in the military, and large outbreaks
no longer occur.  Since 1990, records of all hospitalizations of active duty service
members in military hospitals worldwide have been integrated with military personnel
records
in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS).  During 1990--1998, the overall
rate of hospitalizations from meningococcal disease among enlisted, active-duty
service
members was 0.51 per 100,000 person-years (J. Brundage, DMSS Army Medical
Surveillance Activity, personal communication).
Approximately 180,000 military recruits receive a single dose of
quadrivalent  polysaccharide  meningococcal  vaccine  annually.  Revaccination  is  only
indicated
when military personnel are traveling to countries in which
N. meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic (D. Trump, personal communication).
Before 1999, students reporting to two of the U.S. military academies routinely
received meningococcal vaccine. Last year, the other academies initiated
meningococcal vaccine programs.
MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE AND COLLEGE STUDENTS
Four recent studies provide data concerning the risk for sporadic
meningococcal disease among college students (Table 1)
(12--15).  The  earliest  of  these  studies  was  conducted  during  the  1990--1991  and
1991--1992 school years. A questionnaire
designed to evaluate risk factors for meningococcal disease among college students
was sent to 1,900 universities, resulting in a  38% response rate
(12).   Forty-three  cases  of  meningococcal  disease  were  reported  during  the  2  years
from colleges with a
total enrollment of 4,393,744 students, for a low overall incidence of 1.0 per 100,000
population per year. However, cases of meningococcal disease occurred 9--23 times
more frequently in students residing in dormitories than in those residing in other types
of accommodations.  The low response rate and the inability of the study to control
for
other risk factors (e.g., freshman status) make these results difficult to interpret.
In a retrospective, cohort study conducted in Maryland for the period 1992--1997,
67 cases of meningococcal disease among persons aged 1630 years were identified
by active, laboratory-based surveillance
(13). Of those cases, 14 were among
students  attending  Maryland  colleges,  and  11  were  among  those  in  4-year  colleges.  
The
overall incidence of meningococcal disease in Maryland college students was similar to
the incidence in the U.S. population of persons the same age (1.74/100,000 vs.
1.44/100,000, respectively); however, rates of disease were elevated among students
living in
dormitories  compared  with  students  living  off-campus  (3.2/100,000  vs.  0.96/100,000,
p=0.05).
U.S. surveillance for meningococcal disease in college students was initiated in
1998; from September 1998 through August 1999, 90 cases of meningococcal disease
were reported to CDC (14).  These cases represent approximately 3% of the total cases
of meningococcal disease that occur each year in the United States.  Eighty-seven
(97%)  cases  occurred  in  undergraduate  students,  and  40  (44%)  occurred  among  the
2.27
million freshman students entering college each year
(16).  Among undergraduates, of the 71 (82%) isolates for which serogroup information
was available, 35 (49%)
were serogroup C, 17 (24%) were serogroup B, 15 (21%) were serogroup Y, and one
(1%)
was serogroup W-135.  Eight (9%) students died.  Of the five students who died for
whom serogroup information was available, four had serogroup C isolates and one
had serogroup Y.
U.S. surveillance data from the 1998--1999 school year suggest that the overall
rate of meningococcal disease among undergraduate college students is lower than
the  rate  among  persons  aged  18--23  years  who  are  not  enrolled  in  college  (Table  2)
(0.7
vs. 1.5/100,000, respectively) (14,16).  However, rates were higher among specific
subgroups of college students. Among the approximately 590,000 freshmen who live
in dormitories (17), the rate of meningococcal disease was 4.6/100,000, higher than
any age group in the population other than children aged <2 years, but lower than
the threshold of 10/100,000 recommended for initiating meningococcal vaccination
cam
paigns (6).
Of 90 students who had meningococcal disease attending college during the
1998-1999 school year, 50 were enrolled in a case-control study and matched to 148
controls by school, sex, and undergraduate vs. graduate status
(14).  In a multivariable analysis, freshmen living in dormitories were at higher risk for
meningococcal disease.  In
addition, white race, radiator heat, and recent upper respiratory infection were
associated with disease.
In contrast to the United States, overall rates of meningococcal disease in the
United Kingdom are higher among university students compared with non-students of
similar age (15).  From September 1994 through March 1997, university students had
an
increased annual rate of meningococcal disease (13.2/100,000) compared with
non-students  of  similar  age  in  the  same  health  districts  (5.5/100,000)  and  in  those
health
districts without universities (3.7/100,000).  As in the United States, regression
analysis  revealed  that  "catered  hall  accommodations,"  the  U.K.  equivalent  of
dormitories,
were the main risk factor.  Higher rates of disease were observed at universities
providing catered hall accommodations for >10% of their student population compared
with
those  providing  such  housing  for  <10%  of  students  (15.3/100,000  vs.  5.9/100,000).  
The
increased rate of disease among university students has prompted the United
Kingdom to initiate routine vaccination of incoming university students with a bivalent
A/C polysaccharide vaccine as part of a new vaccination program (see
MMWR  2000;  Vol.49,  No.  RR-6  which  can  be  referenced  in  the  pages  preceding  this
report)
(18).
MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE AND COLLEGE STUDENTS
On September 30, 1997, the American College Health Association (ACHA),
which represents about half of colleges that have student health services, released a
statement recommending that "college health services [take] a more proactive role in
alerting students and their parents about the dangers of meningococcal disease," that
"college students consider vaccination against potentially fatal meningococcal
disease," and that "colleges and universities ensure all students have access to a
vaccination  program  for  those  who  want  to  be  vaccinated"  (Dr.  MarJeanne  Collins,
Chairman,
ACHA Vaccine Preventable Diseases Task Force, personal communication).  Parent and
college student advocates have also encouraged more widespread use of
meningococcal vaccine in college students.  In a joint study by ACHA and CDC, surveys
were sent
to 1,200 ACHA-member schools; of 691 responding schools, 57 (8%) reported that
pre-exposure meningococcal vaccination campaigns had been conducted on their
campus  since  September  1997.  A  median  of  32  students  were  vaccinated  at  each
school
(range: 1--2,300) (J. Capparella, unpublished data).  During the 1998--1999 school year,
3%--5% of 148 students enrolled in a case-control study reported receiving prophylactic
meningococcal vaccination (14).  Before the 1999 fall semester, many schools mailed
information packets to incoming freshmen; data are not yet available regarding the
proportion of students who have been vaccinated.
Cost-effectiveness of meningococcal vaccine in
college students
From a societal perspective, the economic costs and benefits of vaccinating a)
a cohort of 591,587 freshmen who live in dormitories and b) all freshman enrolled in
U.S.
colleges, regardless of housing status (n=2.4 million) were evaluated, assuming
the benefits of vaccination would last 4 years (Scott et al, unpublished data).  Best
and worst case scenarios were evaluated by varying cost of vaccine and
administration (range: $54--$88), costs per hospitalization ($10,924--$24,030), value of
premature
death based on lifetime productivity ($1.3--$4.8 million), cost of side effects of vaccine
per case ($3,500--$12,270 per one million doses), and average cost of treating a case
of sequelae ($0--$1,476). Vaccination coverage (60% and 100%) and vaccine efficacy
(80% and 90%) were also varied for evaluation purposes.
Vaccination of freshmen who live in dormitories would result in the
administration  of  approximately  300,00--500,000  doses  of  vaccine  each  year,
preventing 15--30
cases of meningococcal disease and one to three deaths each year.  The cost per case
prevented would be $600,000--$1.8 million, at a cost per death prevented of $7 million
to $20 million.
Vaccination of all freshman would result in the administration of approximately
1.4--2.3 million doses of vaccine each year, preventing 37--69 cases of meningococcal
disease and two to four deaths caused by meningococcal disease each year.  The cost
per case prevented would be $1.4--2.9 million, at a cost per death prevented of $22
million to $48 million.
These data are similar to data derived from previous studies
(19).  They  suggest  that  for  society  as  a  whole,  vaccination  of  college  students  is
unlikely to be
cost-effective (Scott et al, unpublished data).
RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR  USE  OF  MENINGOCOCCAL  POLYSACCHARIDE  VACCINE  IN
COLLEGE STUDENTS
College freshmen, particularly those who live in dormitories, are at modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease relative to other persons their age.
Vaccination  with  the  currently  available  quadrivalent  meningococcal  polysaccharide
vaccine
will decrease the risk for meningococcal disease among such persons. Vaccination
does not eliminate risk because a) the vaccine confers no protection against serogroup
B disease and b) although the vaccine is highly effective against serogroups C, Y,
W-135, and A, efficacy is <100%.
The risk for meningococcal disease among college students is low; therefore,
vaccination  of  all  college  students,  all  freshmen,  or  only  freshmen  who  live  in
dormitories
or residence halls is not likely to be cost-effective for society as a whole. Thus, ACIP
is issuing the following recommendations regarding the use of meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines for college students.
 Providers of medical care to incoming and current college freshmen,
particularly those who plan to or already live in dormitories and residence halls,
should, during routine medical care, inform these students and their parents
about meningococcal disease and the benefits of vaccination. ACIP does
not recommend that the level of increased risk among freshmen warrants
any specific changes in living situations for freshmen.
 College freshmen who want to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease
should either be administered vaccine (by a doctor's office or student health service)
or directed to a site where vaccine is available.
 The risk for meningococcal disease among non-freshmen college students is
similar to that for the general population. However, the vaccine is safe and
efficacious and therefore can be provided to non-freshmen undergraduates who want
to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease.
 Colleges should inform incoming and/or current freshmen, particularly those
who plan to live or already live in dormitories or residence halls, about
meningococcal disease and the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.
 Public health agencies should provide colleges and health-care providers
with information about meningococcal disease and the vaccine as well as
information regarding how to obtain vaccine.
Additional Considerations about Vaccination of
College Students
Although the need for revaccination of older children has not been
determined, antibody levels decline rapidly over 2--3 years
(6).   Revaccination  may  be  considered  for  freshmen  who  were  vaccinated  more  than
3--5 years earlier
(5).  Routine revaccination of college students who were vaccinated as freshmen is not
indicated.
College students who are at higher risk for meningococcal disease because of
a) underlying immune deficiencies or b) travel to countries in which
N.  meningitidis  is  hyperendemic  or  epidemic  (i.e.,  the  meningitis  belt  of  sub-Saharan
Africa) should
be vaccinated (6).  College students who are employed as research, industrial, and
clinical laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to
N.  meningitidis  in  solutions  that  may  be  aerosolized  should  be  considered  for
vaccination
(6).
No data are available regarding whether other closed civilian populations with
characteristics similar to college freshman living in dormitories (e.g., preparatory
school students) are at the same increased risk for disease. Prevention efforts should
focus
on groups in whom higher risk has been documented.
CONCLUSIONS
College freshmen, especially those who live in dormitories, are at a modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease compared with other persons of the same
age, and vaccination with the currently available quadrivalent meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccine will decrease their risk for meningococcal disease.  Continued
surveillance is necessary to evaluate the impact of these recommendations, which have
already prompted many universities and clinicians to offer vaccine to college freshmen.

meningococcal disease is available from the Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch,

MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE AND COLLEGE STUDENTS
Four recent studies provide data concerning the risk for sporadic
meningococcal disease among college students (Table 1)
(12--15).  The  earliest  of  these  studies  was  conducted  during  the  1990--1991  and

The

were serogroup C, 17 (24%) were serogroup B, 15 (21%) were serogroup Y, and one
(1%)
was serogroup W-135.  Eight (9%) students died.  Of the five students who died for
whom serogroup information was available, four had serogroup C isolates and one
had serogroup Y.
U.S. surveillance data from the 1998--1999 school year suggest that the overall
rate of meningococcal disease among undergraduate college students is lower than
the  rate  among  persons  aged  18--23  years  who  are  not  enrolled  in  college  (Table  2)
(0.7
vs. 1.5/100,000, respectively) (14,16).  However, rates were higher among specific
subgroups of college students. Among the approximately 590,000 freshmen who live
in dormitories (17), the rate of meningococcal disease was 4.6/100,000, higher than
any age group in the population other than children aged <2 years, but lower than
the threshold of 10/100,000 recommended for initiating meningococcal vaccination
cam
paigns (6).
Of 90 students who had meningococcal disease attending college during the
1998-1999 school year, 50 were enrolled in a case-control study and matched to 148
controls by school, sex, and undergraduate vs. graduate status
(14).  In a multivariable analysis, freshmen living in dormitories were at higher risk for
meningococcal disease.  In
addition, white race, radiator heat, and recent upper respiratory infection were
associated with disease.
In contrast to the United States, overall rates of meningococcal disease in the
United Kingdom are higher among university students compared with non-students of
similar age (15).  From September 1994 through March 1997, university students had
an
increased annual rate of meningococcal disease (13.2/100,000) compared with
non-students  of  similar  age  in  the  same  health  districts  (5.5/100,000)  and  in  those
health
districts without universities (3.7/100,000).  As in the United States, regression
analysis  revealed  that  "catered  hall  accommodations,"  the  U.K.  equivalent  of
dormitories,
were the main risk factor.  Higher rates of disease were observed at universities
providing catered hall accommodations for >10% of their student population compared
with
those  providing  such  housing  for  <10%  of  students  (15.3/100,000  vs.  5.9/100,000).  
The
increased rate of disease among university students has prompted the United
Kingdom to initiate routine vaccination of incoming university students with a bivalent
A/C polysaccharide vaccine as part of a new vaccination program (see
MMWR  2000;  Vol.49,  No.  RR-6  which  can  be  referenced  in  the  pages  preceding  this
report)
(18).
MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE AND COLLEGE STUDENTS
On September 30, 1997, the American College Health Association (ACHA),
which represents about half of colleges that have student health services, released a
statement recommending that "college health services [take] a more proactive role in
alerting students and their parents about the dangers of meningococcal disease," that
"college students consider vaccination against potentially fatal meningococcal
disease," and that "colleges and universities ensure all students have access to a
vaccination  program  for  those  who  want  to  be  vaccinated"  (Dr.  MarJeanne  Collins,
Chairman,
ACHA Vaccine Preventable Diseases Task Force, personal communication).  Parent and
college student advocates have also encouraged more widespread use of
meningococcal vaccine in college students.  In a joint study by ACHA and CDC, surveys
were sent
to 1,200 ACHA-member schools; of 691 responding schools, 57 (8%) reported that
pre-exposure meningococcal vaccination campaigns had been conducted on their
campus  since  September  1997.  A  median  of  32  students  were  vaccinated  at  each
school
(range: 1--2,300) (J. Capparella, unpublished data).  During the 1998--1999 school year,
3%--5% of 148 students enrolled in a case-control study reported receiving prophylactic
meningococcal vaccination (14).  Before the 1999 fall semester, many schools mailed
information packets to incoming freshmen; data are not yet available regarding the
proportion of students who have been vaccinated.
Cost-effectiveness of meningococcal vaccine in
college students
From a societal perspective, the economic costs and benefits of vaccinating a)
a cohort of 591,587 freshmen who live in dormitories and b) all freshman enrolled in
U.S.
colleges, regardless of housing status (n=2.4 million) were evaluated, assuming
the benefits of vaccination would last 4 years (Scott et al, unpublished data).  Best
and worst case scenarios were evaluated by varying cost of vaccine and
administration (range: $54--$88), costs per hospitalization ($10,924--$24,030), value of
premature
death based on lifetime productivity ($1.3--$4.8 million), cost of side effects of vaccine
per case ($3,500--$12,270 per one million doses), and average cost of treating a case
of sequelae ($0--$1,476). Vaccination coverage (60% and 100%) and vaccine efficacy
(80% and 90%) were also varied for evaluation purposes.
Vaccination of freshmen who live in dormitories would result in the
administration  of  approximately  300,00--500,000  doses  of  vaccine  each  year,
preventing 15--30
cases of meningococcal disease and one to three deaths each year.  The cost per case
prevented would be $600,000--$1.8 million, at a cost per death prevented of $7 million
to $20 million.
Vaccination of all freshman would result in the administration of approximately
1.4--2.3 million doses of vaccine each year, preventing 37--69 cases of meningococcal
disease and two to four deaths caused by meningococcal disease each year.  The cost
per case prevented would be $1.4--2.9 million, at a cost per death prevented of $22
million to $48 million.
These data are similar to data derived from previous studies
(19).  They  suggest  that  for  society  as  a  whole,  vaccination  of  college  students  is
unlikely to be
cost-effective (Scott et al, unpublished data).
RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR  USE  OF  MENINGOCOCCAL  POLYSACCHARIDE  VACCINE  IN
COLLEGE STUDENTS
College freshmen, particularly those who live in dormitories, are at modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease relative to other persons their age.
Vaccination  with  the  currently  available  quadrivalent  meningococcal  polysaccharide
vaccine
will decrease the risk for meningococcal disease among such persons. Vaccination
does not eliminate risk because a) the vaccine confers no protection against serogroup
B disease and b) although the vaccine is highly effective against serogroups C, Y,
W-135, and A, efficacy is <100%.
The risk for meningococcal disease among college students is low; therefore,
vaccination  of  all  college  students,  all  freshmen,  or  only  freshmen  who  live  in
dormitories
or residence halls is not likely to be cost-effective for society as a whole. Thus, ACIP
is issuing the following recommendations regarding the use of meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines for college students.
 Providers of medical care to incoming and current college freshmen,
particularly those who plan to or already live in dormitories and residence halls,
should, during routine medical care, inform these students and their parents
about meningococcal disease and the benefits of vaccination. ACIP does
not recommend that the level of increased risk among freshmen warrants
any specific changes in living situations for freshmen.
 College freshmen who want to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease
should either be administered vaccine (by a doctor's office or student health service)
or directed to a site where vaccine is available.
 The risk for meningococcal disease among non-freshmen college students is
similar to that for the general population. However, the vaccine is safe and
efficacious and therefore can be provided to non-freshmen undergraduates who want
to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease.
 Colleges should inform incoming and/or current freshmen, particularly those
who plan to live or already live in dormitories or residence halls, about
meningococcal disease and the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.
 Public health agencies should provide colleges and health-care providers
with information about meningococcal disease and the vaccine as well as
information regarding how to obtain vaccine.
Additional Considerations about Vaccination of
College Students
Although the need for revaccination of older children has not been
determined, antibody levels decline rapidly over 2--3 years
(6).   Revaccination  may  be  considered  for  freshmen  who  were  vaccinated  more  than
3--5 years earlier
(5).  Routine revaccination of college students who were vaccinated as freshmen is not
indicated.
College students who are at higher risk for meningococcal disease because of
a) underlying immune deficiencies or b) travel to countries in which
N.  meningitidis  is  hyperendemic  or  epidemic  (i.e.,  the  meningitis  belt  of  sub-Saharan
Africa) should
be vaccinated (6).  College students who are employed as research, industrial, and
clinical laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to
N.  meningitidis  in  solutions  that  may  be  aerosolized  should  be  considered  for
vaccination
(6).
No data are available regarding whether other closed civilian populations with
characteristics similar to college freshman living in dormitories (e.g., preparatory
school students) are at the same increased risk for disease. Prevention efforts should
focus
on groups in whom higher risk has been documented.
CONCLUSIONS
College freshmen, especially those who live in dormitories, are at a modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease compared with other persons of the same
age, and vaccination with the currently available quadrivalent meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccine will decrease their risk for meningococcal disease.  Continued
surveillance is necessary to evaluate the impact of these recommendations, which have
already prompted many universities and clinicians to offer vaccine to college freshmen.

meningococcal disease is available from the Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch,

 Military recruits and college freshmen have several common characteristics
(e.g., age, diverse geographic backgrounds, and crowded living conditions). Therefore,
data obtained from recruits have been used to evaluate meningococcal disease and
vaccine among college freshmen.
 Before 1971, rates of meningococcal disease were elevated among U.S.
military recruits. Outbreaks frequently followed large-scale mobilizations, and recruits in
their initial training camps were at substantially greater risk for disease than were
regular troops (7).  Military recruits enter military service for the first time at a few large
U.S. military recruit training centers.  After 8--12 weeks of initial training, they disperse
to perform their military service at many different locations.  During mobilization for
the Vietnam conflict, outbreaks of meningococcal disease at training camps involving
substantial numbers of recruits were caused by sulfadiazine-resistant strains of
N. meningitidis.  During 1964--1970, the rate of hospitalizations resulting from
meningococcal disease among all active duty service members was 25.2 per 100,000
person- years (LTC Frederick Erdtmann, MD, MPH, Office of the Surgeon General, U.S.
Army, briefing, 1981).  These circumstances led to development of meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines (8). Field trials of group C polysaccharide vaccine among U.S.
Army recruits demonstrated an 89.5% reduction in the rate of serogroup C
meningococcal disease among vaccinated versus nonvaccinated recruits
(9,10); thus, beginning in October 1971, all new recruits were vaccinated with the group
C vaccine
(11),  and  by  Fall  1982,  all  recruits  were  receiving  the  quadrivalent  polysaccharide
vaccine
(7).  However, rates of meningococcal disease in U.S. Army personnel declined before
the
1971 vaccination campaigns (7), suggesting that smaller recruit populations at training
installations and the natural periodicity of outbreaks may have contributed to the
decline in disease.
 Rates of meningococcal disease remain low in the military, and large outbreaks
no longer occur.  Since 1990, records of all hospitalizations of active duty service
members in military hospitals worldwide have been integrated with military personnel
records
in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS).  During 1990--1998, the overall
rate of hospitalizations from meningococcal disease among enlisted, active-duty
service
members was 0.51 per 100,000 person-years (J. Brundage, DMSS Army Medical
Surveillance Activity, personal communication).
 Approximately 180,000 military recruits receive a single dose of
quadrivalent  polysaccharide  meningococcal  vaccine  annually.  Revaccination  is  only
indicated
when military personnel are traveling to countries in which
N. meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic (D. Trump, personal communication).
 Before 1999, students reporting to two of the U.S. military academies routinely
received meningococcal vaccine. Last year, the other academies initiated
meningococcal vaccine programs.
MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE AND COLLEGE STUDENTS
Four recent studies provide data concerning the risk for sporadic
meningococcal disease among college students (Table 1)
(12--15).  The  earliest  of  these  studies  was  conducted  during  the  1990--1991  and
1991--1992 school years. A questionnaire
designed to evaluate risk factors for meningococcal disease among college students
was sent to 1,900 universities, resulting in a  38% response rate
(12).   Forty-three  cases  of  meningococcal  disease  were  reported  during  the  2  years
from colleges with a
total enrollment of 4,393,744 students, for a low overall incidence of 1.0 per 100,000
population per year. However, cases of meningococcal disease occurred 9--23 times
more frequently in students residing in dormitories than in those residing in other types
of accommodations.  The low response rate and the inability of the study to control
for
other risk factors (e.g., freshman status) make these results difficult to interpret.
In a retrospective, cohort study conducted in Maryland for the period 1992--1997,
67 cases of meningococcal disease among persons aged 1630 years were identified
by active, laboratory-based surveillance
(13). Of those cases, 14 were among
students  attending  Maryland  colleges,  and  11  were  among  those  in  4-year  colleges.  
The
overall incidence of meningococcal disease in Maryland college students was similar to
the incidence in the U.S. population of persons the same age (1.74/100,000 vs.
1.44/100,000, respectively); however, rates of disease were elevated among students
living in
dormitories  compared  with  students  living  off-campus  (3.2/100,000  vs.  0.96/100,000,
p=0.05).
U.S. surveillance for meningococcal disease in college students was initiated in
1998; from September 1998 through August 1999, 90 cases of meningococcal disease
were reported to CDC (14).  These cases represent approximately 3% of the total cases
of meningococcal disease that occur each year in the United States.  Eighty-seven
(97%)  cases  occurred  in  undergraduate  students,  and  40  (44%)  occurred  among  the
2.27
million freshman students entering college each year
(16).  Among undergraduates, of the 71 (82%) isolates for which serogroup information
was available, 35 (49%)
were serogroup C, 17 (24%) were serogroup B, 15 (21%) were serogroup Y, and one
(1%)
was serogroup W-135.  Eight (9%) students died.  Of the five students who died for
whom serogroup information was available, four had serogroup C isolates and one
had serogroup Y.
U.S. surveillance data from the 1998--1999 school year suggest that the overall
rate of meningococcal disease among undergraduate college students is lower than
the  rate  among  persons  aged  18--23  years  who  are  not  enrolled  in  college  (Table  2)
(0.7
vs. 1.5/100,000, respectively) (14,16).  However, rates were higher among specific
subgroups of college students. Among the approximately 590,000 freshmen who live
in dormitories (17), the rate of meningococcal disease was 4.6/100,000, higher than
any age group in the population other than children aged <2 years, but lower than
the threshold of 10/100,000 recommended for initiating meningococcal vaccination
cam
paigns (6).
Of 90 students who had meningococcal disease attending college during the
1998-1999 school year, 50 were enrolled in a case-control study and matched to 148
controls by school, sex, and undergraduate vs. graduate status
(14).  In a multivariable analysis, freshmen living in dormitories were at higher risk for
meningococcal disease.  In
addition, white race, radiator heat, and recent upper respiratory infection were
associated with disease.
In contrast to the United States, overall rates of meningococcal disease in the
United Kingdom are higher among university students compared with non-students of
similar age (15).  From September 1994 through March 1997, university students had
an
increased annual rate of meningococcal disease (13.2/100,000) compared with
non-students  of  similar  age  in  the  same  health  districts  (5.5/100,000)  and  in  those
health
districts without universities (3.7/100,000).  As in the United States, regression
analysis  revealed  that  "catered  hall  accommodations,"  the  U.K.  equivalent  of
dormitories,
were the main risk factor.  Higher rates of disease were observed at universities
providing catered hall accommodations for >10% of their student population compared
with
those  providing  such  housing  for  <10%  of  students  (15.3/100,000  vs.  5.9/100,000).  
The
increased rate of disease among university students has prompted the United
Kingdom to initiate routine vaccination of incoming university students with a bivalent
A/C polysaccharide vaccine as part of a new vaccination program (see
MMWR  2000;  Vol.49,  No.  RR-6  which  can  be  referenced  in  the  pages  preceding  this
report)
(18).
MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE AND COLLEGE STUDENTS
On September 30, 1997, the American College Health Association (ACHA),
which represents about half of colleges that have student health services, released a
statement recommending that "college health services [take] a more proactive role in
alerting students and their parents about the dangers of meningococcal disease," that
"college students consider vaccination against potentially fatal meningococcal

ACHA Vaccine Preventable Diseases Task Force, personal communication).  Parent and
college student advocates have also encouraged more widespread use of
meningococcal vaccine in college students.  In a joint study by ACHA and CDC, surveys
were sent
to 1,200 ACHA-member schools; of 691 responding schools, 57 (8%) reported that
pre-exposure meningococcal vaccination campaigns had been conducted on their
campus  since  September  1997.  A  median  of  32  students  were  vaccinated  at  each
school
(range: 1--2,300) (J. Capparella, unpublished data).  During the 1998--1999 school year,
3%--5% of 148 students enrolled in a case-control study reported receiving prophylactic
meningococcal vaccination (14).  Before the 1999 fall semester, many schools mailed
information packets to incoming freshmen; data are not yet available regarding the
proportion of students who have been vaccinated.
Cost-effectiveness of meningococcal vaccine in
college students
From a societal perspective, the economic costs and benefits of vaccinating a)
a cohort of 591,587 freshmen who live in dormitories and b) all freshman enrolled in
U.S.
colleges, regardless of housing status (n=2.4 million) were evaluated, assuming
the benefits of vaccination would last 4 years (Scott et al, unpublished data).  Best
and worst case scenarios were evaluated by varying cost of vaccine and
administration (range: $54--$88), costs per hospitalization ($10,924--$24,030), value of
premature
death based on lifetime productivity ($1.3--$4.8 million), cost of side effects of vaccine
per case ($3,500--$12,270 per one million doses), and average cost of treating a case
of sequelae ($0--$1,476). Vaccination coverage (60% and 100%) and vaccine efficacy
(80% and 90%) were also varied for evaluation purposes.
Vaccination of freshmen who live in dormitories would result in the
administration  of  approximately  300,00--500,000  doses  of  vaccine  each  year,
preventing 15--30
cases of meningococcal disease and one to three deaths each year.  The cost per case
prevented would be $600,000--$1.8 million, at a cost per death prevented of $7 million
to $20 million.
Vaccination of all freshman would result in the administration of approximately
1.4--2.3 million doses of vaccine each year, preventing 37--69 cases of meningococcal
disease and two to four deaths caused by meningococcal disease each year.  The cost
per case prevented would be $1.4--2.9 million, at a cost per death prevented of $22
million to $48 million.
These data are similar to data derived from previous studies
(19).  They  suggest  that  for  society  as  a  whole,  vaccination  of  college  students  is
unlikely to be
cost-effective (Scott et al, unpublished data).
RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR  USE  OF  MENINGOCOCCAL  POLYSACCHARIDE  VACCINE  IN
COLLEGE STUDENTS
College freshmen, particularly those who live in dormitories, are at modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease relative to other persons their age.
Vaccination  with  the  currently  available  quadrivalent  meningococcal  polysaccharide
vaccine
will decrease the risk for meningococcal disease among such persons. Vaccination
does not eliminate risk because a) the vaccine confers no protection against serogroup
B disease and b) although the vaccine is highly effective against serogroups C, Y,
W-135, and A, efficacy is <100%.
The risk for meningococcal disease among college students is low; therefore,
vaccination  of  all  college  students,  all  freshmen,  or  only  freshmen  who  live  in
dormitories
or residence halls is not likely to be cost-effective for society as a whole. Thus, ACIP
is issuing the following recommendations regarding the use of meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines for college students.
 Providers of medical care to incoming and current college freshmen,
particularly those who plan to or already live in dormitories and residence halls,
should, during routine medical care, inform these students and their parents
about meningococcal disease and the benefits of vaccination. ACIP does
not recommend that the level of increased risk among freshmen warrants
any specific changes in living situations for freshmen.
 College freshmen who want to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease
should either be administered vaccine (by a doctor's office or student health service)
or directed to a site where vaccine is available.
 The risk for meningococcal disease among non-freshmen college students is
similar to that for the general population. However, the vaccine is safe and
efficacious and therefore can be provided to non-freshmen undergraduates who want
to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease.
 Colleges should inform incoming and/or current freshmen, particularly those
who plan to live or already live in dormitories or residence halls, about
meningococcal disease and the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.
 Public health agencies should provide colleges and health-care providers
with information about meningococcal disease and the vaccine as well as
information regarding how to obtain vaccine.
Additional Considerations about Vaccination of
College Students
Although the need for revaccination of older children has not been
determined, antibody levels decline rapidly over 2--3 years
(6).   Revaccination  may  be  considered  for  freshmen  who  were  vaccinated  more  than
3--5 years earlier
(5).  Routine revaccination of college students who were vaccinated as freshmen is not
indicated.
College students who are at higher risk for meningococcal disease because of
a) underlying immune deficiencies or b) travel to countries in which
N.  meningitidis  is  hyperendemic  or  epidemic  (i.e.,  the  meningitis  belt  of  sub-Saharan
Africa) should
be vaccinated (6).  College students who are employed as research, industrial, and
clinical laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to
N.  meningitidis  in  solutions  that  may  be  aerosolized  should  be  considered  for
vaccination
(6).
No data are available regarding whether other closed civilian populations with
characteristics similar to college freshman living in dormitories (e.g., preparatory
school students) are at the same increased risk for disease. Prevention efforts should
focus
on groups in whom higher risk has been documented.
CONCLUSIONS
College freshmen, especially those who live in dormitories, are at a modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease compared with other persons of the same
age, and vaccination with the currently available quadrivalent meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccine will decrease their risk for meningococcal disease.  Continued
surveillance is necessary to evaluate the impact of these recommendations, which have
already prompted many universities and clinicians to offer vaccine to college freshmen.

meningococcal disease is available from the Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch,

 Four recent studies provide data concerning the risk for sporadic
meningococcal disease among college students (Table 1)
(12--15).  The  earliest  of  these  studies  was  conducted  during  the  1990--1991  and
1991--1992 school years. A questionnaire
designed to evaluate risk factors for meningococcal disease among college students
was sent to 1,900 universities, resulting in a  38% response rate
(12).   Forty-three  cases  of  meningococcal  disease  were  reported  during  the  2  years
from colleges with a
total enrollment of 4,393,744 students, for a low overall incidence of 1.0 per 100,000
population per year. However, cases of meningococcal disease occurred 9--23 times
more frequently in students residing in dormitories than in those residing in other types
of accommodations.  The low response rate and the inability of the study to control
for
other risk factors (e.g., freshman status) make these results difficult to interpret.
 In a retrospective, cohort study conducted in Maryland for the period 1992--1997,
67 cases of meningococcal disease among persons aged 1630 years were identified
by active, laboratory-based surveillance
(13). Of those cases, 14 were among
students  attending  Maryland  colleges,  and  11  were  among  those  in  4-year  colleges.  
The
overall incidence of meningococcal disease in Maryland college students was similar to
the incidence in the U.S. population of persons the same age (1.74/100,000 vs.
1.44/100,000, respectively); however, rates of disease were elevated among students
living in
dormitories  compared  with  students  living  off-campus  (3.2/100,000  vs.  0.96/100,000,
p=0.05).
 U.S. surveillance for meningococcal disease in college students was initiated in
1998; from September 1998 through August 1999, 90 cases of meningococcal disease
were reported to CDC (14).  These cases represent approximately 3% of the total cases
of meningococcal disease that occur each year in the United States.  Eighty-seven
(97%)  cases  occurred  in  undergraduate  students,  and  40  (44%)  occurred  among  the
2.27
million freshman students entering college each year
(16).  Among undergraduates, of the 71 (82%) isolates for which serogroup information
was available, 35 (49%)
were serogroup C, 17 (24%) were serogroup B, 15 (21%) were serogroup Y, and one
(1%)
was serogroup W-135.  Eight (9%) students died.  Of the five students who died for
whom serogroup information was available, four had serogroup C isolates and one
had serogroup Y.
 U.S. surveillance data from the 1998--1999 school year suggest that the overall
rate of meningococcal disease among undergraduate college students is lower than
the  rate  among  persons  aged  18--23  years  who  are  not  enrolled  in  college  (Table  2)
(0.7
vs. 1.5/100,000, respectively) (14,16).  However, rates were higher among specific
subgroups of college students. Among the approximately 590,000 freshmen who live
in dormitories (17), the rate of meningococcal disease was 4.6/100,000, higher than
any age group in the population other than children aged <2 years, but lower than
the threshold of 10/100,000 recommended for initiating meningococcal vaccination
cam
paigns (6).
 Of 90 students who had meningococcal disease attending college during the
1998-1999 school year, 50 were enrolled in a case-control study and matched to 148
controls by school, sex, and undergraduate vs. graduate status
(14).  In a multivariable analysis, freshmen living in dormitories were at higher risk for
meningococcal disease.  In
addition, white race, radiator heat, and recent upper respiratory infection were
associated with disease.
 In contrast to the United States, overall rates of meningococcal disease in the
United Kingdom are higher among university students compared with non-students of
similar age (15).  From September 1994 through March 1997, university students had
an
increased annual rate of meningococcal disease (13.2/100,000) compared with
non-students  of  similar  age  in  the  same  health  districts  (5.5/100,000)  and  in  those
health
districts without universities (3.7/100,000).  As in the United States, regression
analysis  revealed  that  "catered  hall  accommodations,"  the  U.K.  equivalent  of
dormitories,
were the main risk factor.  Higher rates of disease were observed at universities
providing catered hall accommodations for >10% of their student population compared
with
those  providing  such  housing  for  <10%  of  students  (15.3/100,000  vs.  5.9/100,000).  
The
increased rate of disease among university students has prompted the United
Kingdom to initiate routine vaccination of incoming university students with a bivalent
A/C polysaccharide vaccine as part of a new vaccination program (see
MMWR  2000;  Vol.49,  No.  RR-6  which  can  be  referenced  in  the  pages  preceding  this
report)
(18).
MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE AND COLLEGE STUDENTS
On September 30, 1997, the American College Health Association (ACHA),
which represents about half of colleges that have student health services, released a
statement recommending that "college health services [take] a more proactive role in
alerting students and their parents about the dangers of meningococcal disease," that
"college students consider vaccination against potentially fatal meningococcal
disease," and that "colleges and universities ensure all students have access to a
vaccination  program  for  those  who  want  to  be  vaccinated"  (Dr.  MarJeanne  Collins,
Chairman,
ACHA Vaccine Preventable Diseases Task Force, personal communication).  Parent and
college student advocates have also encouraged more widespread use of
meningococcal vaccine in college students.  In a joint study by ACHA and CDC, surveys
were sent
to 1,200 ACHA-member schools; of 691 responding schools, 57 (8%) reported that
pre-exposure meningococcal vaccination campaigns had been conducted on their
campus  since  September  1997.  A  median  of  32  students  were  vaccinated  at  each
school
(range: 1--2,300) (J. Capparella, unpublished data).  During the 1998--1999 school year,
3%--5% of 148 students enrolled in a case-control study reported receiving prophylactic
meningococcal vaccination (14).  Before the 1999 fall semester, many schools mailed
information packets to incoming freshmen; data are not yet available regarding the
proportion of students who have been vaccinated.
Cost-effectiveness of meningococcal vaccine in
college students
From a societal perspective, the economic costs and benefits of vaccinating a)
a cohort of 591,587 freshmen who live in dormitories and b) all freshman enrolled in
U.S.
colleges, regardless of housing status (n=2.4 million) were evaluated, assuming
the benefits of vaccination would last 4 years (Scott et al, unpublished data).  Best
and worst case scenarios were evaluated by varying cost of vaccine and
administration (range: $54--$88), costs per hospitalization ($10,924--$24,030), value of
premature
death based on lifetime productivity ($1.3--$4.8 million), cost of side effects of vaccine
per case ($3,500--$12,270 per one million doses), and average cost of treating a case
of sequelae ($0--$1,476). Vaccination coverage (60% and 100%) and vaccine efficacy
(80% and 90%) were also varied for evaluation purposes.
Vaccination of freshmen who live in dormitories would result in the
administration  of  approximately  300,00--500,000  doses  of  vaccine  each  year,
preventing 15--30
cases of meningococcal disease and one to three deaths each year.  The cost per case
prevented would be $600,000--$1.8 million, at a cost per death prevented of $7 million
to $20 million.
Vaccination of all freshman would result in the administration of approximately
1.4--2.3 million doses of vaccine each year, preventing 37--69 cases of meningococcal
disease and two to four deaths caused by meningococcal disease each year.  The cost
per case prevented would be $1.4--2.9 million, at a cost per death prevented of $22
million to $48 million.
These data are similar to data derived from previous studies
(19).  They  suggest  that  for  society  as  a  whole,  vaccination  of  college  students  is
unlikely to be
cost-effective (Scott et al, unpublished data).
RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR  USE  OF  MENINGOCOCCAL  POLYSACCHARIDE  VACCINE  IN
COLLEGE STUDENTS
College freshmen, particularly those who live in dormitories, are at modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease relative to other persons their age.
Vaccination  with  the  currently  available  quadrivalent  meningococcal  polysaccharide
vaccine
will decrease the risk for meningococcal disease among such persons. Vaccination
does not eliminate risk because a) the vaccine confers no protection against serogroup
B disease and b) although the vaccine is highly effective against serogroups C, Y,
W-135, and A, efficacy is <100%.
The risk for meningococcal disease among college students is low; therefore,
vaccination  of  all  college  students,  all  freshmen,  or  only  freshmen  who  live  in
dormitories
or residence halls is not likely to be cost-effective for society as a whole. Thus, ACIP
is issuing the following recommendations regarding the use of meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines for college students.
 Providers of medical care to incoming and current college freshmen,
particularly those who plan to or already live in dormitories and residence halls,
should, during routine medical care, inform these students and their parents
about meningococcal disease and the benefits of vaccination. ACIP does
not recommend that the level of increased risk among freshmen warrants
any specific changes in living situations for freshmen.
 College freshmen who want to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease
should either be administered vaccine (by a doctor's office or student health service)
or directed to a site where vaccine is available.
 The risk for meningococcal disease among non-freshmen college students is
similar to that for the general population. However, the vaccine is safe and
efficacious and therefore can be provided to non-freshmen undergraduates who want
to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease.
 Colleges should inform incoming and/or current freshmen, particularly those
who plan to live or already live in dormitories or residence halls, about
meningococcal disease and the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.
 Public health agencies should provide colleges and health-care providers
with information about meningococcal disease and the vaccine as well as
information regarding how to obtain vaccine.
Additional Considerations about Vaccination of
College Students
Although the need for revaccination of older children has not been
determined, antibody levels decline rapidly over 2--3 years
(6).   Revaccination  may  be  considered  for  freshmen  who  were  vaccinated  more  than
3--5 years earlier
(5).  Routine revaccination of college students who were vaccinated as freshmen is not
indicated.
College students who are at higher risk for meningococcal disease because of
a) underlying immune deficiencies or b) travel to countries in which
N.  meningitidis  is  hyperendemic  or  epidemic  (i.e.,  the  meningitis  belt  of  sub-Saharan
Africa) should
be vaccinated (6).  College students who are employed as research, industrial, and
clinical laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to
N.  meningitidis  in  solutions  that  may  be  aerosolized  should  be  considered  for
vaccination
(6).
No data are available regarding whether other closed civilian populations with
characteristics similar to college freshman living in dormitories (e.g., preparatory
school students) are at the same increased risk for disease. Prevention efforts should
focus
on groups in whom higher risk has been documented.
CONCLUSIONS
College freshmen, especially those who live in dormitories, are at a modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease compared with other persons of the same
age, and vaccination with the currently available quadrivalent meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccine will decrease their risk for meningococcal disease.  Continued
surveillance is necessary to evaluate the impact of these recommendations, which have
already prompted many universities and clinicians to offer vaccine to college freshmen.

meningococcal disease is available from the Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch,
Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases,

 From a societal perspective, the economic costs and benefits of vaccinating a)
a cohort of 591,587 freshmen who live in dormitories and b) all freshman enrolled in
U.S.
colleges, regardless of housing status (n=2.4 million) were evaluated, assuming
the benefits of vaccination would last 4 years (Scott et al, unpublished data).  Best
and worst case scenarios were evaluated by varying cost of vaccine and
administration (range: $54--$88), costs per hospitalization ($10,924--$24,030), value of

of sequelae ($0--$1,476). Vaccination coverage (60% and 100%) and vaccine efficacy
(80% and 90%) were also varied for evaluation purposes.
 Vaccination of freshmen who live in dormitories would result in the
administration  of  approximately  300,00--500,000  doses  of  vaccine  each  year,
preventing 15--30
cases of meningococcal disease and one to three deaths each year.  The cost per case
prevented would be $600,000--$1.8 million, at a cost per death prevented of $7 million
to $20 million.
 Vaccination of all freshman would result in the administration of approximately
1.4--2.3 million doses of vaccine each year, preventing 37--69 cases of meningococcal
disease and two to four deaths caused by meningococcal disease each year.  The cost
per case prevented would be $1.4--2.9 million, at a cost per death prevented of $22
million to $48 million.
 These data are similar to data derived from previous studies
(19).  They  suggest  that  for  society  as  a  whole,  vaccination  of  college  students  is
unlikely to be
cost-effective (Scott et al, unpublished data).
RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR  USE  OF  MENINGOCOCCAL  POLYSACCHARIDE  VACCINE  IN
COLLEGE STUDENTS
College freshmen, particularly those who live in dormitories, are at modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease relative to other persons their age.
Vaccination  with  the  currently  available  quadrivalent  meningococcal  polysaccharide
vaccine
will decrease the risk for meningococcal disease among such persons. Vaccination
does not eliminate risk because a) the vaccine confers no protection against serogroup
B disease and b) although the vaccine is highly effective against serogroups C, Y,
W-135, and A, efficacy is <100%.
The risk for meningococcal disease among college students is low; therefore,
vaccination  of  all  college  students,  all  freshmen,  or  only  freshmen  who  live  in
dormitories
or residence halls is not likely to be cost-effective for society as a whole. Thus, ACIP
is issuing the following recommendations regarding the use of meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines for college students.
 Providers of medical care to incoming and current college freshmen,
particularly those who plan to or already live in dormitories and residence halls,
should, during routine medical care, inform these students and their parents
about meningococcal disease and the benefits of vaccination. ACIP does
not recommend that the level of increased risk among freshmen warrants
any specific changes in living situations for freshmen.
 College freshmen who want to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease
should either be administered vaccine (by a doctor's office or student health service)
or directed to a site where vaccine is available.
 The risk for meningococcal disease among non-freshmen college students is
similar to that for the general population. However, the vaccine is safe and
efficacious and therefore can be provided to non-freshmen undergraduates who want
to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease.
 Colleges should inform incoming and/or current freshmen, particularly those
who plan to live or already live in dormitories or residence halls, about
meningococcal disease and the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.
 Public health agencies should provide colleges and health-care providers
with information about meningococcal disease and the vaccine as well as
information regarding how to obtain vaccine.
Additional Considerations about Vaccination of
College Students
Although the need for revaccination of older children has not been
determined, antibody levels decline rapidly over 2--3 years
(6).   Revaccination  may  be  considered  for  freshmen  who  were  vaccinated  more  than
3--5 years earlier
(5).  Routine revaccination of college students who were vaccinated as freshmen is not
indicated.
College students who are at higher risk for meningococcal disease because of
a) underlying immune deficiencies or b) travel to countries in which
N.  meningitidis  is  hyperendemic  or  epidemic  (i.e.,  the  meningitis  belt  of  sub-Saharan
Africa) should
be vaccinated (6).  College students who are employed as research, industrial, and
clinical laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to
N.  meningitidis  in  solutions  that  may  be  aerosolized  should  be  considered  for
vaccination
(6).
No data are available regarding whether other closed civilian populations with
characteristics similar to college freshman living in dormitories (e.g., preparatory
school students) are at the same increased risk for disease. Prevention efforts should
focus
on groups in whom higher risk has been documented.
CONCLUSIONS
College freshmen, especially those who live in dormitories, are at a modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease compared with other persons of the same
age, and vaccination with the currently available quadrivalent meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccine will decrease their risk for meningococcal disease.  Continued
surveillance is necessary to evaluate the impact of these recommendations, which have
already prompted many universities and clinicians to offer vaccine to college freshmen.

meningococcal disease is available from the Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch,

 College freshmen, particularly those who live in dormitories, are at modestly
increased risk for meningococcal disease relative to other persons their age.
Vaccination  with  the  currently  available  quadrivalent  meningococcal  polysaccharide
vaccine
will decrease the risk for meningococcal disease among such persons. Vaccination
does not eliminate risk because a) the vaccine confers no protection against serogroup
B disease and b) although the vaccine is highly effective against serogroups C, Y,
W-135, and A, efficacy is <100%.
 The risk for meningococcal disease among college students is low; therefore,
vaccination  of  all  college  students,  all  freshmen,  or  only  freshmen  who  live  in
dormitories
or residence halls is not likely to be cost-effective for society as a whole. Thus, ACIP
is issuing the following recommendations regarding the use of meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines for college students.
 Providers of medical care to incoming and current college freshmen,
particularly those who plan to or already live in dormitories and residence halls,
should, during routine medical care, inform these students and their parents
about meningococcal disease and the benefits of vaccination. ACIP does
not recommend that the level of increased risk among freshmen warrants
any specific changes in living situations for freshmen.
 College freshmen who want to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease
should either be administered vaccine (by a doctor's office or student health service)
or directed to a site where vaccine is available.
 The risk for meningococcal disease among non-freshmen college students is
similar to that for the general population. However, the vaccine is safe and
efficacious and therefore can be provided to non-freshmen undergraduates who want
to reduce their risk for meningococcal disease.
 Colleges should inform incoming and/or current freshmen, particularly those
who plan to live or already live in dormitories or residence halls, about
meningococcal disease and the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.
