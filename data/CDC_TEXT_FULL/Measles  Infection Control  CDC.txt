Healthcare  Personnel:  Epidemiology  and  Control  of  Selected  Infections  Transmitted
Among  Healthcare  Personnel  and  Patients  (2024)  guideline.  Measles  was  declared
eliminated  in  the  US  in  2000;  however,  community-acquired  measles  cases  have
persisted  as  a  result  of  importation.34  Outbreaks  of  measles  in  healthcare  settings
remain  well  described,  and  transmission  to  and  from  healthcare  personnel  (HCP)
continues  to  be  reported.5678  HCP  are  considered  to  be  at  higher  risk  for  measles
acquisition  than  the  general  population,  as  patients  with  measles  often  seek  medical
care due to the severity of their symptoms56789; further, measles is highly contagious
and  potentially  under-recognized,  with  delays  in  patient  isolation  and  diagnosis.7
Prevention of transmission of measles in healthcare settings involves (a) ensuring HCP
have  presumptive  evidence  of  immunity;  (b)  using  infection  prevention  and  control
practices
 as
 recommended
 by
 CDC
(https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/appendix/type-duration-preca
utions.html#M);10  and  (c)  excluding  potentially  infectious  HCP  from  work.911  The
criteria  for  presumptive  evidence  of  immunity  to  measles  and  recommendations  for
measles
 vaccination
 of
 HCP
 are
 maintained
 by
 CDC
 and
 ACIP
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/mmr.html).2  Measles  is  a
highly  contagious  viral  illness  spread  primarily  via  small  particles  that  remain
suspended  in  air.  HCP  exposures  to  measles  in  a  healthcare  setting  are  defined  as
spending  any  amount  of  time  while  unprotected  (i.e.,  not  wearing  recommended
respiratory protection):  Measles virus is thought to be contagious to others in the air
for up to 2 hours.1213 In general, the time that the air in a room occupied by a measles
patient is thought to remain infectious to others depends on several factors including
the room’s air changes per hour, up to a maximum of 2 hours.141516 Humidity and air
flow dynamics between rooms may impact the efficiency of measles transmission, and
distances farther from the source patient may pose decreased risk of transmission to
others. An example of an exposure to measles includes HCP providing in-room care to
an  unmasked  patient  while  not  wearing  recommended  respiratory  protection.
Information  on  room  air  changes  per  hour  and  times  for  estimating  99.9%  airborne
contaminant removal from the air is provided on the CDC website, in Table B.1., “Air
changes/hour (ACH) and time required for airborne contaminant removal by efficiency"
(https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/appendix/air.html#tabl
eb1).17  Measles  is  characterized  by  a  prodrome  of  fever,  malaise,  cough,  coryza,
conjunctivitis, and Koplik spots (clustered white lesions on the buccal mucosa), followed
by  onset  of  a  maculopapular  rash.18  Because  measles  is  uncommon  in  the  US,
providers  may  have  a  low  index  of  suspicion  for  measles  and  ultimately  delay  the
correct  diagnosis.18  The  incubation  period  of  measles  from  exposure  to  prodrome
averages 11 - 12 days. The time from exposure to rash onset averages 14 days, with a
range  of  7  -  21  days.19  Persons  with  measles  are  usually  considered  infectious  from
four days before until four days after onset of rash (with rash onset considered as day
0),  and  immunocompromised  persons  with  measles  may  shed  virus  for  extended
periods.19 Laboratory testing is used to confirm measles infection, and both detection
of  measles-specific  IgM  antibody  and  measles  RNA  by  real-time  polymerase  chain
reaction  tests  are  recommended  to  confirm  measles  infection.20  Information  on

 Exposed
 HCP
 without
presumptive evidence of immunity should receive postexposure vaccination as soon as
possible in accordance with CDC and ACIP recommendations. In some circumstances,
immune  globulin  may  be  appropriate  to  offer  these  HCP,  but  this  should  be  done  in
accordance
 with
 CDC
 and
 ACIP
 recommendations
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/mmr.html).2  Some  HCP  with
documented presumptive evidence of immunity to measles will require administration
of vaccine during a measles outbreak.2 Guidance regarding postexposure and outbreak
use
 of
 vaccine
 is
 available
 on
 the
 CDC
 website
(https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6204a1.htm).22
