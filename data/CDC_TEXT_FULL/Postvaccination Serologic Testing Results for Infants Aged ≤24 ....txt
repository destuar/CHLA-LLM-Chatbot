and the title of the report in the subject line of e-mail. An estimated 25,000 infants are
born  to  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  (HBsAg)-positive  women  annually  in  the  United
States (1). With no intervention, 40%–90% of these infants will acquire hepatitis B virus
(HBV)  infection  (2,3).  Approximately  90%  of  infected  infants  develop  chronic  HBV
infection, with a 15%–25% risk for premature death from cirrhosis or cancer of the liver
(4). To prevent perinatal HBV transmission, the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices  (ACIP)  recommends  that  infants  born  to  HBsAg-positive  women  receive
postexposure  prophylaxis  with  hepatitis  B  vaccine  (HepB)  and  hepatitis  B  immune
globulin  (HBIG)  within  12  hours  of  birth,  and  complete  the  3-dose  HepB  series.  To
determine  infant  outcomes  after  postexposure  prophylaxis,  ACIP  recommends
postvaccination  serologic  testing  (PVST)  at  age  9–18  months  (4).  To  evaluate  the
implementation of these recommendations, CDC assessed outcomes at age 24 months
(through  2011)  among  infants  born  to  HBsAg-positive  women  enrolled  during
2008–2009  in  Enhanced  Perinatal  Hepatitis  B  Case  Management  Projects  (EPHBP).  Of
4,214  EPHBP-managed  infants  who  completed  ≥3  HepB  doses,  63.7%  had  reported
PVST results, 13.3% had reported PVST results but infant age was unknown, and 23.0%
had  no  reported  PVST  results.  Of  2,683  infants  with  PVST  results  by  age  24  months,
93.3% were protected, 1.2% were infected, 3.2% remained susceptible, and 2.3% had
indeterminate  results.  ACIP-recommended  postexposure  prophylaxis  was  highly
effective among infants who completed vaccination and received PVST. PVST is critical
for guiding medical management of infants born to HBsAg-positive women, identifying
infants with HBV infection and in need of further care, and monitoring progress toward
the  elimination  of  perinatal  HBV  transmission.   In  2007,  CDC  funded  EPHBP  to
characterize  HBsAg-positive  pregnant  women  and  assess  outcomes  among  their
infants.  Five  project  sites,  in  Florida,  Michigan,  Minnesota,  New  York  City,  and  Texas
(excluding cities of Houston and San Antonio), collected and reported data to CDC. Data
of women enrolled in EPHBP during 2008–2009 were reviewed; maternal characteristics
from  the  first  pregnancy  on  record  were  used.  Records  of  all  infants  born  to  these
women were reviewed to age 24 months; PVST records were examined for infants who
completed  ≥3  HepB  doses  (with  and  without  HBIG).  Of  infants  with  reported  PVST

"susceptible"  (anti-HBs-negative,  HBsAg-negative),  or  "indeterminate"  (all  other  result
combinations).  A  protective  anti-HBs  result  was  defined  as  ≥10  mIU/mL.  Records  of
susceptible infants were reviewed for revaccination and repeat PVST. Bivariate analysis
of  mother/infant  pairs  was  used  to  examine  associations  between  maternal
characteristics  (age,  race/ethnicity,  place  of  birth,  primary  language)  and  infant
outcomes (≥3 HepB doses, PVST receipt); significant variables were evaluated further
in  a  multivariable  logistic  regression  model.   EPHBP  managed  5,075  infants  born  to
4,938  HBsAg-positive  women  in  2008–2009.  Most  of  the  women  were  aged  20–39
years,  self-identified  as  Asian/Pacific  Islander  (API)  or  non-Hispanic  black,  were
foreign-born, and almost half indicated a primary language other than English (Table 1).
Maternal characteristics were not significantly associated with infant receipt of ≥3 HepB
doses.  Infants  born  to  women  who  were  Hispanic  (odds  ratio  [OR]  =  0.43;  95%
confidence interval [CI] = 0.31–0.61), U.S.-born (OR = 0.60; CI = 0.47–0.75), or whose
primary language was English (OR = 0.66; CI = 0.56–0.78) were significantly less likely
to  receive  PVST  compared  to  infants  born  to  women  who  were  non-Hispanic,
foreign-born, and whose primary language was non-English, respectively. Infants born
to API women (OR = 1.50; CI = 1.29–1.74) were significantly more likely to receive PVST
compared to infants born to non-API women. After controlling for maternal place of birth
(U.S.-born  versus  foreign-born)  and  primary  language  (English  versus  non-English),
infants  born  to  API  women  were  slightly  more  likely  to  receive  PVST  than  infants  of
non-API  women  (OR  =  1.09,  p<0.001).   By  age  24  months,  4,214  EPHBP-managed
infants  received  ≥3  HepB  doses  (Table  2).  Although  3,244  (77.0%)  of  these  infants
received  PVST,  412  (9.8%)  received  incomplete  PVST,  either  anti-HBs  only  (41)  or
HBsAg  only  (371).  Among  the  4,214  EPHBP-managed  infants,  2,073  (49.1%)  were
tested  at  age  9–18  months;  259  (6.2%)  were  tested  before  age  9  months  and  351
(8.4%) were tested after age 18 months. Age at testing was unknown (not reported) for
561  (13.3%)  infants.  Most  (355)  incomplete  results  were  from  one  site  where  infants
were tested only for HBsAg and test dates were not reported  (Table 3).  Of the 2,683
infants  with  reported  PVST  dates  and  results,  114  remained  susceptible  after  initial
vaccination and PVST. Of these infants, 29 received three additional HepB doses and
repeat  PVST,  as  recommended  by  ACIP;  27  were  protected  and  two  remained
susceptible. Overall, 93.3% of tested infants were protected, 1.2% were infected, 3.2%
remained susceptible, and 2.3% had indeterminate results (Table 4).  Ruthie Benson,

for  infants  born  to  HBsAg-positive  mothers  protects  85%–95%  of  infants  from
perinatally acquired HBV infection (4). Since 1990, CDC has funded perinatal hepatitis B
prevention programs to identify HBsAg-positive pregnant women and ensure that their
infants  receive  postexposure  prophylaxis,  including  PVST.  PVST  identifies  infants  who
are protected, remain susceptible after a primary HepB series, or develop HBV infection
and  should  be  referred  for  continuing  medical  care  (4–6).   Among  infants  born  to
HBsAg-positive mothers and managed by perinatal hepatitis B prevention programs in
the United States, and who received ≥3 HepB doses, PVST rates by age 15–27 months
increased from 25% in 1994 to 56% in 2008 (1). In another study, 57% of infants born
to  HBsAg-positive  mothers  during  2003–2005  received  HBsAg  testing  (7).  In
comparison,  77.0%  of  EPHBP-managed  infants  received  PVST,  and  63.7%  had  known
serologic  outcomes  (Table  3).  Although  rates  of  PVST  have  increased,  this  analysis
highlights areas in need of improvement. Strategies are needed to increase the rates
for  overall  testing  and  testing  for  both  anti-HBs  and  HBsAg,  which  are  required  to
confirm  outcomes.  Of  infants  in  EPHBP,  9.8%  received  only  one  of  the  two
recommended  serologic  tests.  An  anti-HBs  result  <10  mIU/mL  is  insufficient  to
determine whether the infant is susceptible or is HBV-infected. Alone, an anti-HBs result
≥10 mIU/mL does not confirm that the infant is protected; the HBsAg result also must
be negative. A negative HBsAg test result by itself does not indicate whether the infant
is  protected  by  vaccination  or  remains  susceptible.   ACIP  recommends  PVST  at  age
9–18 months (4). Infants should be tested starting at age 9 months, if at least 1 month
has  passed  since  the  last  HepB  dose,  to  ensure  that  all  HBV-infected  infants  are
identified*  (4,8).  Of  EPHBP-managed  infants,  14.6%  received  PVST  outside  of  the
recommended  time  frame,  and  13.3%  had  an  unknown  age  at  testing.  Infants  who
remain  susceptible  after  an  initial  HepB  series  without  timely  PVST  to  prompt
revaccination  have  continuing  risk  for  transmission  from  household  contacts  with
chronic HBV infection. Intervals ≥4 months between the final HepB dose and PVST have
been associated with waning of anti-HBs titers, which might fail to confirm protection
and  result  in  unnecessary  revaccination  (6,9).   In  this  analysis,  infants  born  to  API
women  were  significantly  more  likely  to  receive  PVST.  Previous  studies  have  yielded
mixed  results  (5,6,10).  A  study  examining  data  from  1992–2000  found  that  infants
whose mothers were non-Hispanic white, were aged <20 years, were U.S.-born, or had
a household income <$15,000 were less likely to receive PVST (6,10). In another study,
however,  PVST  did  not  differ  significantly  by  maternal  age  or  race  among  infants
managed  by  the  Louisiana  Office  of  Public  Health  (5).   The  results  of  this  study  are
subject  to  at  least  two  limitations.  First,  results  from  the  EPHBP  sites  might  not  be
representative  of  all  births  to  HBsAg-positive  women  in  the  United  States;
EPHBP-managed women and infants comprise about 25% of CDC's estimated births to
HBsAg-positive women. Second, the completeness of reporting PVST results to CDC was
not  examined.  However,  overall  PVST  rates  of  EPHBP-managed  infants  were  high
compared with rates reported in other studies (1,7).  To achieve optimal prevention of
perinatal  HBV  infection,  HBsAg-positive  pregnant  women  must  be  identified  before
delivery,  and  their  infants  must  complete  appropriate  and  timely  postexposure
prophylaxis. PVST (anti-HBs and HBsAg) as soon as age 9 months and at least 1 month
after  the  last  HepB  dose  has  been  given  determines  if  infants  are  susceptible  and
should  be  revaccinated  and  retested,  or  are  infected  and  require  additional  medical
care. Although universal recommendations for HepB vaccination have been published
(4), no universal recommendations for HBV screening of infants or children have been
issued. HBV infection usually is asymptomatic, and therefore is unlikely to be detected
without testing, until complications arise. Conducting timely PVST and reporting results
to  public  health  officials  ensures  that  infants  born  to  HBsAg-positive  women  receive
appropriate follow-up, and is a key element of surveillance to monitor progress toward
the elimination of perinatal HBV transmission.  Immunization Svcs Div, National Center
for  Immunization  and  Respiratory  Diseases,  CDC.   *Infants  who  complete  the  HepB
series with the Haemophilus influenzae type b combination product (COMVAX, Merck &
Co.) at age 12–15 months are eligible for PVST 1 month after the last dose (2).  What is
already  known  on  this  topic?   Infants  born  to  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen-positive
women have a 40%–90% chance of acquiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Infected
infants have a 90% risk of chronic HBV infection, which can result in premature death
from liver failure or cancer. Postexposure immunoprophylaxis in infancy prevents 85%
to 95% of perinatal infections. To determine infant outcomes, including whether infants
require  additional  vaccination  for  protection,  postvaccination  serologic  testing  is
recommended  1  month  after  completing  the  hepatitis  B  vaccine  series  (age  9–18
months).   What  is  added  by  this  report?   Among  infants  with  reported  outcomes,
postvaccination  serologic  testing  data  from  Enhanced  Perinatal  Hepatitis  B  Case
Management  Projects  indicated  that  timely  postexposure  prophylaxis  might  be  93%
effective  in  protecting  infants  from  perinatal  hepatitis  B  infection.  However,  23.0%  of
infants had no reported postvaccination serologic testing.  What are the implications for
public  health  practice?   Postvaccination  serologic  testing  (hepatitis  B  surface  antigen
[HBsAg]  and  hepatitis  B  surface  antigen  antibody)  for  infants  born  to  HBsAg-positive
women  is  important  to  determine  appropriate  infant  medical  follow-up.  Test  results
should  be  reported  to  perinatal  hepatitis  B  program  coordinators  who  can  assist
families in assuring infant protection and who monitor progress toward elimination of
perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission.  TABLE 1. Characteristics of hepatitis B surface
