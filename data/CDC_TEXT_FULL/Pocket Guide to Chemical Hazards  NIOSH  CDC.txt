The NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards (NPG) informs workers, employers, and
occupational  health  professionals  about  workplace  chemicals  and  their  hazards.  The
NPG  gives  general  industrial  hygiene  information  for  hundreds  of  chemicals/classes.
The  NPG  clearly  presents  key  data  for  chemicals  or  substance  groupings  (such  as
cyanides,  fluorides,  manganese  compounds)  that  are  found  in  workplaces.  The  guide
offers key facts, but does not give all relevant data. The NPG helps users recognize and
control  workplace  chemical  hazards.  NIOSH  offers  four  versions  of  the  NPG:  print,
online,  PDF,  and  mobile  web  app.  Enter  search  terms  separated  by  spaces.  For
chemicals  not  listed  and/or  lacking  occupational  exposure  limits  (OELs),  NIOSH
recommends consulting the NIOSH Occupational Exposure Banding Safety and Health
Topic Page. The PDF version of the NPG is 6,192KB The NIOSH Pocket Guide Mobile Web
App requires an Apple iPhone or Android phone. The NIOSH Pocket Guide includes the
