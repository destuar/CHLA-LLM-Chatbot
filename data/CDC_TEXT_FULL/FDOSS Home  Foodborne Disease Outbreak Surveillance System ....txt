collects information from state and local health departments about foodborne disease
outbreaks. Outbreaks are occurrences in which two or more people get the same illness
from the same contaminated food or drink. Outbreaks provide important insights into
how germs are spread, which illness-causing germ are typically found in which foods,
and  how  to  prevent  food  poisoning.  Each  year,  CDC  summarizes  FDOSS  data  in  an
annual  surveillance  report  and  makes  it  available  through  the  National  Outbreak
Reporting System (NORS) Dashboard. Learn more > Use this interactive tool to learn
