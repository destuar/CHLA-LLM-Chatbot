SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza viruses are found to be co-circulating based upon local public
health  surveillance  data  and  testing  at  local  healthcare  facilities.  While  these
considerations  are  specific  to  care  of  residents  residing  in  nursing  homes,  some
practices could be adapted for use in other long-term care settings (e.g. assisted living
communities). Place symptomatic residents in Transmission-Based Precautions using all
recommended  PPE  for  care  of  a  resident  with  suspected  SARS-CoV-2  infection.1
Because some of the signs and symptoms of influenza and COVID-19 are similar, it may
be  difficult  to  tell  the  difference  between  these  two  respiratory  diseases  based  on
symptoms  alone.  Residents  in  the  facility  who  develop  symptoms  of  acute  illness
consistent with influenza or COVID-19 should be moved to a single room, if available, or
remain in their current room, pending results of viral testing. They should not be placed
in a room with new roommates, nor should they be moved to a COVID-19 care unit (if
one  exists),  unless  they  are  confirmed  to  have  COVID-19  by  SARS-CoV-2  testing.
Nursing  home  residents,  including  older  adults,  those  who  are  medically  fragile  and
those with neurological or neurocognitive conditions, may manifest atypical signs and
symptoms  of  SARS-CoV-2  or  influenza  virus  infection  and  may  not  have  fever.  Older
adults  with  COVID-19  may  not  always  manifest  fever  or  respiratory  symptoms.  Less
common symptoms can include new or worsening malaise, headache, or new dizziness,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of taste or smell. Test any resident with symptoms
of  COVID-19  or  influenza  for  both  viruses.  Because  SARS-CoV-2  and  influenza  virus
co-infection can occur, a positive influenza test result without SARS-CoV-2 testing does
not  exclude  SARS-CoV-2  infection,  and  a  positive  SARS-CoV-2  test  result  without
influenza  testing  does  not  exclude  influenza  virus  infection.  Stay  connected  with
the healthcare-associated infection program in your state health department, as well as
your  local  health  department,  and  their  notification  requirements.  The  local  public
health and state health departments should be notified of every suspected or confirmed
influenza  or  SARS-CoV-2  outbreak  in  a  long-term  care  facility,  especially  if  a  resident
develops  influenza  while  on  or  after  receiving  antiviral  chemoprophylaxis.  A)  Obtain
respiratory
 specimens
 for
 influenza
 and
 SARS-CoV-2
 testing.2,3
 Check
 the
manufacturer’s  package  insert  for  approved  respiratory  specimens.  There  are  no
FDA-cleared  influenza  diagnostic  assays  that  utilize  saliva  specimens.  If  available,
multiplex nucleic acid detection assay for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B viruses can be
performed onsite, or at an offsite clinical laboratory.4,5 Two different specimens may
need to be collected if a multiplex nucleic acid detection assay including both influenza
viruses  and  SARS-CoV-2  is  unavailable.2,3  B)  Test  for  SARS-CoV-2  by  nucleic  acid
detection5  OR  by  SARS-CoV-2  antigen  detection  assay.6  Because  antigen  detection
assays  have  lower  sensitivity  than  nucleic  acid  detection  assays  for  detecting
SARS-CoV-2  in  upper  respiratory  tract  specimens,  a  negative  SARS-CoV-2  antigen
detection assay result in a symptomatic person does not exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection
and  should  be  confirmed  by  either  a  negative  result  from  a  SARS-CoV-2  nucleic  acid
detection assay or a second negative antigen test result on an upper respiratory tract
specimen collected 48 hours after the first negative test result. 7 If the second antigen
test is negative, per FDA guidance, a third antigen test could be considered if there is a
high  clinical  suspicion  of  COVID-19.  New  SARS-CoV-2  infection  identified  in  HCP  or
nursing  home-onset  infection  in  a  resident  should  prompt  additional  testing  of  other
residents and staff in the facility.1 C) Test for influenza by rapid influenza nucleic acid
detection  assay;8  if  a  rapid  influenza  nucleic  acid  detection  assay  is  not  available,
perform  rapid  influenza  antigen  detection  assay.9  Because  of  lower  sensitivities  to
detect influenza viruses, confirm negative rapid influenza antigen detection test results
in  a  symptomatic  person  by  influenza  nucleic  acid  detection  assay.  D)  Test  for  other
respiratory pathogens; if residents with acute respiratory illness test negative for both
influenza and SARS-CoV-2 per the above testing recommendations, consider additional
viral (e.g., RSV) or bacterial testing based on respiratory pathogens known or suspected
of circulating in the community. Placement Decisions A) Residents confirmed to have
SARS-CoV-2  infection  should  be  placed  in  a  single  room,  if  available,  or  housed  with
other residents with only SARS-CoV-2 infection. If unable to move a resident, he or she
could  remain  in  the  current  room  with  measures  in  place  to  reduce  transmission  to
roommates  (e.g.,  optimizing  ventilation).  Residents  found  to  have  SARS-CoV-2  and
influenza  virus  co-infection  should  be  placed  in  a  single  room  or  housed  with  other
co-infected  residents.  These  residents  should  continue  to  be  cared  for  using  all
recommended PPE for the care of a resident with SARS-CoV-2 infection.1 If single room
isolation  or  cohorting  of  residents  with  SARS-CoV-2  and  influenza  virus  co-infection  is
not possible, consult with public health authorities for guidance on other management
options  (e.g.,  transferring  the  resident;  placing  physical  barriers  between  beds  in
shared rooms and initiating antiviral chemoprophylaxis for roommates to reduce their
risk of acquiring influenza, improving ventilation by adding HEPA filters). B) Residents
confirmed to have influenza virus infection only should be placed in a single room, if
available, or housed with other residents with only influenza virus infection. If unable to
move a resident, he or she could remain in the current room with measures in place to
reduce
 transmission
 to
 roommates
 (e.g.,
 optimizing
 ventilation,
 antiviral
chemoprophylaxis for exposed roommates). Residents with influenza should be placed
in  Droplet  Precautions,  in  addition  to  Standard  Precautions.  As  part  of  Standard
Precautions, eye protection should be worn if splashes or sprays are anticipated (e.g.,
the resident is coughing or sneezing). Because it can be difficult to anticipate potential
for coughs and sneezes, facilities might consider having healthcare personnel routinely
wear  eye  protection  for  the  care  of  residents  with  influenza.  C)  Residents  with
symptoms of acute respiratory illness who are determined to have neither SARS-CoV-2
nor  influenza  virus  infection  should  be  cared  for  using  Standard  Precautions  and  any
additional  Transmission-Based  Precautions  based  on  their  suspected  or  confirmed
diagnosis.10  Clinical  Management11  A)  Prescribe  antiviral  treatment  as  soon  as
possible if influenza testing is positive OR prescribe empiric antiviral treatment based
upon  a  clinical  suspicion  of  influenza  while  test  results  are  pending  for  symptomatic
residents.11-13  Antiviral  treatment  for  influenza  should  be  administered  as  soon  as
possible  following  clinical  diagnosis.  B)  Properly  manage  residents  with  SARS-CoV-2
infection. Recommendations for treatment of persons with COVID-19 are available from
the  National  Institutes  of  Health  COVID-19  Treatment  Guidelines  Panel.  Treatment
should  be  administered  as  soon  as  possible  for  nursing  home  residents  with
mild-to-moderate  COVID-19  who  are  at  high  risk  of  progression  to  severe  COVID-19.

D)  Influenza  antiviral  chemoprophylaxis  considerations.11,12,15  The  facility  should
promptly  initiate  antiviral  chemoprophylaxis  with  oral  oseltamivir  to  all  exposed
individuals  (e.g.,  roommates)  of  residents  with  confirmed  influenza.  When  at  least  2
residents are ill within 72 hours of each other with laboratory-confirmed influenza, the
facility should expand antiviral chemoprophylaxis to non-ill residents living on the same
unit  as  the  residents  with  influenza  (outbreak  affected  units),  regardless  of  influenza
vaccination status. Persons receiving antiviral chemoprophylaxis who develop signs or
symptoms  should  be  tested  (see  above)  and  switched  to  antiviral  treatment  doses
pending  results.  E)  Encourage  influenza  vaccination  for  unvaccinated  residents  and
HCP.  The  facility  should  encourage  influenza  vaccination  of  all  residents  and  staff.  F)
Encourage  residents  and  HCP  to  remain  up  to  date  with  recommended  COVID-19
vaccine  doses.  The  facility  should  encourage  all  individuals  to  be  up  to  date  with  all
recommended  COVID-19  vaccine  doses,  based  upon  the  latest  recommendations.  G)
Encourage RSV vaccination for unvaccinated residents aged 60 years and older, based
upon  shared  decision-making.   The  facility  should  encourage  RSV  vaccination  based
upon discussions between the patient, the patient’s family or guardian, and healthcare
provider. H) Encourage pneumococcal vaccination for unvaccinated residents aged 65
years  and  older,  and  for  younger  high-risk  individuals.  The  facility  should  encourage
eligible  high-risk  residents  to  receive  pneumococcal  vaccination.  I)  Simultaneously
administer  the  vaccines  for  which  residents  and  HCP  are  eligible.   In  general,
simultaneous  administration  of  vaccines  remains  a  best  practice.  Providers  should
continue  to  simultaneously  administer  the  vaccines  for  which  a  patient  is  eligible,
including
 COVID-19,
 influenza,
 and
 pneumococcal
 vaccines.
 Simultaneous
administration of RSV vaccine with other vaccines for older adults is also acceptable.
When deciding whether to simultaneously administer other vaccines with RSV vaccine
on  the  same  day,  providers  should  consider  whether  the  patient  is  up  to  date  with
recommendations for currently recommended vaccines, the feasibility of administering
additional vaccine doses later, risk for acquiring vaccine-preventable disease, vaccine
reactogenicity profiles, and patient preferences. To receive weekly email updates about
