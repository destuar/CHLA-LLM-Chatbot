Summary
Two  live,  attenuated  varicella  zoster  virus--containing  vaccines  are  available  in  the
United States for prevention of 
varicella: 1) a single-antigen varicella vaccine 
(VARIVAX,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), which was licensed 
in the United States in 1995 for use among healthy children aged 
>12 months, adolescents, and adults; and 2) a 
combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine 
(ProQuad,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), which 
was  licensed  in  the  United  States  in  2005  for  use  among  healthy  children  aged  12
months--12 years. Initial Advisory 
Committee  on  Immunization  Practices  (ACIP)  recommendations  for  prevention  of
varicella issued in 1995 (CDC. Prevention 
of  varicella:  recommendations  of  the  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization  Practices
[ACIP]. MMWR 1996;45[No. 
RR-11])  included  routine  vaccination  of  children  aged  12--18  months,  catch-up
vaccination of susceptible children aged 19 
months--12 years, and vaccination of susceptible persons who have close contact with
persons at high risk for serious complications 
(e.g., health-care personnel and family contacts of immunocompromised persons). One
dose of vaccine was recommended 
for children aged 12 months--12 years and 2 doses, 4--8 weeks apart, for persons aged 
>13 years. In 1999, ACIP updated the recommendations (CDC. Prevention of varicella:
updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1999;48[No. RR-6]) to include establishing child
care and school entry requirements, use of 
the vaccine following exposure and for outbreak control, use of the vaccine for certain
children infected with 
human immunodeficiency virus, and vaccination of adolescents and adults at high risk
for exposure or transmission. 
In June 2005 and June 2006, ACIP adopted new recommendations regarding the use of
live, attenuated varicella 
vaccines for prevention of varicella. This report revises, updates, and replaces the 1996
and 1999 ACIP statements for prevention 
of varicella. The new recommendations include 1) implementation of a routine 2-dose
varicella vaccination program 
for children, with the first dose administered at age 12--15 months and the second dose
at age 4--6 years; 2) a second dose 
catch-up varicella vaccination for children, adolescents, and adults who previously had
received 1 dose; 3) routine vaccination of 
all  healthy  persons  aged  >13  years  without  evidence  of  immunity;  4)  prenatal
assessment and postpartum vaccination; 
5) expanding the use of the varicella vaccine for HIV-infected children with age-specific
CD4+T lymphocyte percentages of 
15%--24% and adolescents and adults with CD4+T lymphocyte counts 
>200 cells/µL; and 6) establishing middle school, 
high school, and college entry vaccination requirements. ACIP also approved criteria for
evidence of immunity to varicella.
Introduction
Varicella  is  a  highly  infectious  disease  caused  by  the  varicella-zoster  virus  (VZV).
Secondary attack rates for this virus 
might reach 90% for susceptible household contacts. VZV causes a systemic infection
that results typically in lifetime immunity. 
In otherwise healthy persons, clinical illness after reexposure is rare.
In 1995, a vaccine to prevent varicella 
(VARIVAX,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) was licensed 
in the United States for use among healthy children aged 
>12 months, adolescents, and adults; recommendations of the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
regarding use of the varicella vaccine have been published previously 
(1,2) This report revises, updates, and replaces earlier ACIP statements 
(Table 1).
Methods
In  response  to  increasing  reports  of  varicella  outbreaks  among  highly  vaccinated
populations 
(3--6),  ACIP's  measles-mumps-rubella  and  varicella  (MMRV)  workgroup  first  met  in
February 2004 to review data related to varicella vaccine use in 
the  United  States  since  implementation  of  the  vaccination  program  in  1995  and  to
consider recommendation options 
for improving control of varicella disease. The workgroup held monthly conference calls
and met in person three times a year. 
The  workgroup  reviewed  data  on  the  impact  of  the  1-dose  varicella  vaccination
program, including data on vaccination 
coverage,  changes  in  varicella  epidemiology,  transmission  from  vaccinated  persons
with varicella, vaccine effectiveness, 
immune  response  to  vaccination,  evidence  of  immunity,  and  potential  risk  factors  for
vaccine failure. Published and 
unpublished data related to correlates of protection, safety, immunogenicity, and 
efficacy† of the new quadrivalent MMRV vaccine and 
the  immunogenicity  and  efficacy  of  a  second  dose  of  varicella  vaccine  also  were
reviewed. 
Cost-benefit  and  cost-effectiveness  analyses  were  considered,  including  revised
cost-benefit analysis of both the 1- and 2-dose programs for children 
compared with no vaccination program and the incremental benefit of a second dose.
Presentations were made to the full ACIP 
meetings in October 2004, February 2005, June 2005, and June 2006. Recommendation
options were developed and discussed by 
the
 MMRV
 workgroup.
 When
 definitive
 research
 evidence
 was
 lacking,
 the
recommendations incorporated expert opinion of 
the workgroup members. The workgroup sought input from partner organizations (i.e.,
the American Academy of 
Pediatrics  [AAP],  the  American  Academy  of  Family  Physicians  [AAFP],  the  American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 
the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the 
Association of Immunization Managers) and from state public 
health professionals and immunization program directors. Proposed recommendations
and a draft statement were presented to 
the  full  ACIP  in  June  2005  and  June  2006.  After  deliberations,  final  ACIP
recommendations were approved in 2005 and 
2006.  Modifications  to  the  draft  statement  were  made  following  CDC  and  external
review process to update and clarify wording 
in the document.
Epidemiology of Varicella
General
VZV is transmitted from person to person by direct contact, inhalation of aerosols from
vesicular fluid of skin lesions 
of acute varicella or zoster, or infected respiratory tract secretions that also might be
aerosolized. The virus enters the 
host through the upper-respiratory tract or the conjunctiva.
The average incubation period for varicella is 14--16 
days§ after exposure to rash; however, this period can vary (range: 
10--21  days).  The  period  of  contagiousness  of  infected  persons  is  estimated  to  begin
1--2 days before the onset of rash and to 
end when all lesions are crusted, typically 4--7 days after onset of rash 
(7). Persons who have progressive varicella 
(i.e., development of new lesions for >7 days) might be contagious longer, presumably
because their immune response is 
depressed, which allows viral replication to persist. VZV 
remains dormant in sensory-nerve ganglia and might be 
reactivated  at  a  later  time,  causing  herpes  zoster  (HZ)  (i.e.,  shingles),  a  painful
vesicular rash typically appearing in a dermatomal distribution 
of one or two sensory-nerve roots.
Since  implementation  of  a  universal  childhood  varicella  vaccination  program  in  1995,
the epidemiology and 
clinical characteristics of varicella in the United States have changed, with substantial
declines in morbidity and mortality 
attributable  to  varicella.  No  consistent  changes  in  HZ  epidemiology  have  been
documented.
Vaccinated
 persons
 might
 develop
 modified
 varicella
 disease
 with
 atypical
presentation. Varicella disease that develops 
>42 days after vaccination (i.e., breakthrough varicella) typically is mild, with <50 skin
lesions, low or no fever, and shorter 
(4--6  days)  duration  of  illness.  The  rash  is  more  likely  to  be  predominantly
maculopapular rather than vesicular. 
Nevertheless, breakthrough varicella is contagious.
Prevaccine Era
Before the introduction of varicella vaccine in 1995, varicella was a universal childhood
disease in the United States, 
with peak incidence in the spring and an average annual incidence of 15--16 cases per
1,000 population. On the basis of data 
from  the  National  Health  Interview  Survey  (NHIS)  for  1980--1990,  an  average  of  4
million cases were estimated to have 
occurred 
annually (annual incidence rate: 15 cases per 1,000 population) 
(8). Varicella was not a nationally notifiable disease 
when vaccine was introduced in 1995, and surveillance data were limited. In 1994, only
28 states, the District of Columbia, 
and  New  York  City  reported  cases  to  CDC's  National  Notifiable  Disease  Surveillance
System (NNDSS); reporting was 
passive, with estimated completeness ranging from <0.1% to 20% 
(9).
In multiple studies, age-specific incidence data were derived from NHIS and from state
and local surveys 
(8,10,11).  During  1980--1990,  an  estimated  33%  of  cases  occurred  among
preschool-aged children (i.e., children aged 12 months--4 years), 
and 44% occurred among school-aged children (i.e., children aged 5--9 years) (annual
incidence rates: 82.8 and 91.1 cases 
per  1,000  children,  respectively).  Approximately  90%--92%  of  cases  occurred  among
persons aged <15 years, and cases 
occurred  rarely  among  persons  aged  >50  years.  However,  studies  using  data  from
state and local surveys conducted during 
1990--1992  and  during  1994--1995  indicated  that  the  highest  incidence  of  varicella
occurred among preschool-aged rather than 
school-aged children, indicating that the disease was being acquired at earlier ages 
(10,11). National seroprevalence data for 
1988--1994  indicated  that  95.5%  of  adults  aged  20--29  years,  98.9%  of  adults  aged
30--39 years, and >99.6% of adults aged 
>40 years were immune to VZV (12). However, for reasons that are not well 
understood, the epidemiology of varicella differs between countries with temperate and
tropical climates 
(13--18). In the majority of countries with temperate climates, 
>90%  of  persons  are  infected  by  adolescence  whereas  in  countries  with  tropical
climates, a higher 
proportion of infections are acquired at older ages, which results in higher susceptibility
among adults 
(19).
Estimates  of  the  burden  of  varicella  hospitalization  varied  according  to  the  year(s)
studied, the source of data, and 
the  definitions  used  for  a  varicella-related  hospitalization  (20--23).  Estimates  were
higher if varicella was listed as either a 
principal  or  a  secondary  cause  of  hospitalization,  in  which  case  some  incidental
varicella hospitalization might have been 
included.  During  1988--1995,  an  estimated  10,632  hospitalizations  were  attributable
annually to varicella in the United States 
(range: 8,198--16,586) (20). Another study demonstrated an annual average of 15,073
hospitalizations during 1993--1995, but 
this period might have included an epidemic year 
(22). Overall rates of hospitalization for varicella during 1988--1995 
ranged from 2.3 to 6.0 cases per 100,000 population. If any 
varicella-related hospital discharge diagnostic code was included, 
rates varied between 5.0 and 7.0 cases per 100,000 population 
(20--23).
During 1988--1995, persons without severe 
immuno-compromising conditions or treatments comprised the 
largest proportion (89%) of annual varicella-related hospitalizations 
(20). Before vaccination, children aged 
<4 years accounted for 43%--44% of hospitalizations, and persons aged 
>20 years accounted for 32%--33% 
(20,22). The rate of complications from varicella was substantially higher for 
persons aged >20 years and for infants (i.e., children aged 
<1  year).  Adults  aged  >20  years  were  13  times  more  likely  to  be  hospitalized  when
they had varicella than children aged 
5--9 years, and infants aged <1 year were six times more likely to be hospitalized than
children aged 5--9 years 
(20). The most common complications of 
varicella that resulted in hospitalizations were skin and soft tissue infections (especially
invasive group A streptococcal 
infections),  pneumonia,  dehydration,  and  encephalitis.  In  1980,  an  association  was
identified between Reye syndrome and the use 
of  aspirin  during  varicella  or  influenza-like  illness;  since  then,  Reye  syndrome,  which
was once considered a 
common complication resulting from varicella infection, has become rare 
(24--26).
During  1970--1994,  the  average  annual  number  of  deaths  for  which  varicella  was
recorded as the underlying cause was 
105;  the  overall  average  annual  varicella  mortality  rate  was  0.4  deaths  per  1  million
population. The age distribution of 
varicella deaths has shifted during this period. During 1970--1974, persons aged <20
years accounted for 80% of varicella 
deaths,  compared  with  46%  during  1990--1994.  During  1970--1994,  the  average
case-fatality rate (CFR) for varicella for all 
ages  combined  ranged  from  2.0  to  3.6  per  100,000  cases,  with  higher  rates  among
infants and adults aged 
>20  years  (27).  Although  CFRs  declined  substantially  during  this  period,  the  risk  for
varicella-related death during 1990--1994 was still 
25 times higher for adults than for children aged 12 months--4 years (CFR: 21.3 and 0.8
per 100,000 cases, 
respectively). During the same period, 89% of varicella deaths among children and 75%
of varicella deaths among adults occurred in 
persons without severe underlying immunocompromising medical conditions. The most
common complications among persons 
who died of varicella were pneumonia, central nervous system complications (including
encephalitis), secondary infection, 
and hemorrhagic conditions. A recent reanalysis of varicella deaths also considered 
varicella  when  listed  as  a  contributing  cause  of  death  in  addition  to  the  underlying
cause studied in the previous report 
(28). During 1990--1994, a varicella diagnosis was 
listed on an average of 145 death certificates per year (105 as an underlying cause and
40 as a contributing cause), with an 
overall annual varicella mortality rate of 0.6 deaths per 1 million 
population.
Varicella  during  pregnancy  can  have  adverse  consequences  for  the  fetus  and  infant,
including congenital varicella 
syndrome (see Prenatal and Perinatal Exposure). Reliable data on the number of cases
of congenital varicella syndrome are not 
available.  However,  on  the  basis  of  age-specific  varicella  incidence  (from  NHIS),  the
annual number of births, and the risk 
for congenital varicella syndrome (1.1% overall risk in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy),
44 cases of congenital 
varicella  syndrome  are  estimated  to  have  occurred  each  year  in  the  United  States
during the prevaccine era 
(29).
Postvaccine Era
In 1995, a varicella vaccine 
(VARIVAX,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) was licensed in the 
United States for use among healthy children aged 
>12 months, adolescents, and adults. At that time, ACIP recommended 
routine  varicella  vaccination  of  children  aged  12--18  months,  catch-up  vaccination  of
susceptible children aged 19 months--12 
years, and vaccination of susceptible persons who have close contact with persons at
high risk for serious complications (e.g., 
health-care workers and family contacts of 
immunocompromised
 persons)
 (1;
 Table
 1).
 In
 1999,
 ACIP
 updated
 the
recommendations 
to include child care and school entry requirements, use of the vaccine after exposure
and for outbreak control, use of the vaccine 
for certain children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and vaccination
of adolescents and adults at high risk 
for exposure or transmission (2; Table 1).
During 1997--2005, national varicella vaccination coverage among children aged 19--35
months increased from 27% 
to 88%, with no statistically significant difference in coverage by race or ethnicity 
(30). In 2005, state-specific varicella vaccination coverage ranged from 69% to 96% 
(31). National surveillance data continue to be limited, but passive 
surveillance data in certain states have documented a decline in 
varicella incidence.
In four states (Illinois, Michigan, Texas, and West Virginia) with adequate 
(>5% of expected cases during 
1990--1994)  reporting  to  NNDSS,  varicella  incidence  for  2004  declined  53%--88%
compared with the average incidence for 
1990--1994,  with  vaccination  coverage  among  children  aged  19--35  months  ranging
from 82% to 88% 
(32; CDC, unpublished data, 2006). During 2003--2005, the number of cases increased
in Illinois and Texas; the biggest increase (56%) occurred in 
Texas  (Figure  1).  The  number  of  cases  remained  stable  in  Michigan  (Figure  1)  and
declined minimally in West Virginia. 
In 1995, along with implementation of the national vaccination program, CDC instituted
active surveillance for varicella 
in  three  communities  (Antelope  Valley,  California;  Travis  County,  Texas;  and  West
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) in 
collaboration with state and local health departments to establish baseline data and to
monitor trends in varicella disease after 
introduction of varicella vaccine. By 2000, vaccination coverage among children 19--35
months in these three communities had 
reached 74%--84%, and reported total varicella cases had declined 71%--84% 
(33). Although incidence declined to the greatest 
extent (83%--90%) among children aged 12 months--4 years, incidence declined in all
age groups, including infants and 
adults,  indicating  the  herd  immunity  effects  of  the  vaccination  program.  Since  2001,
only two sites were funded to 
continue  surveillance  (Antelope  Valley  and  West  Philadelphia).  By  2005,  vaccination
coverage in these two sites had increased to 
90%, and the reduction in incidence had reached 90% and 91%, respectively 
(34). During 1996--2005, as vaccination 
coverage continued to increase, the proportion of persons with varicella who had been
vaccinated increased from 2% to 56%. 
During 1995--2004, peak incidence for varicella cases in active surveillance sites shifted
from age 3--6 years to age 9--11 years.
After introduction of vaccine in 1995, the number and rate of annual varicella-related
hospitalizations declined. In 
one study of a nationally representative sample that was conducted during 1993--2001,
varicella hospitalizations declined 
75%  (22).  In  another  study,  the  annual  varicella-related  hospitalization  rate  declined
88% during 1994--2002 
(23) (Figure 2). Hospitalization rates declined 100% among 
infants, and substantial declines also were recorded in all other age groups (up 
to age 50 years); hospitalization rates declined 91% among children aged <10 years,
92% among children and adolescents 
aged 10--19 years, and 78% among adults aged 20--49 years. The greater decline in
hospitalizations among children led to 
an increase in the proportion of varicella-related 
hospitalizations among adults (40% of hospitalizations in 2002 occurred 
among persons aged >20 years) (23). In the 
combined active surveillance area, varicella-related hospitalizations declined from 
2.4--4.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 population during 1995--1998 to 1.5 per 100,000
population in 2000 
(33) and to 0.8 per 100,000 population in 2005 
(34).
During  1995--2001,  the  number  of  deaths  for  which  varicella  was  listed  as  the
underlying cause decreased from 115 to 
26 (28) (Figure 3). Since then, the number of deaths declined further; 16 deaths were
reported in 2003. Age-adjusted 
mortality rates decreased 66%, from an average of 0.41 deaths per 1 million population
during 1990--1994 to 0.14 during 
1999--2001. The decline was observed in all age groups <50 years, with the greatest
reduction (92%) occurring among children aged 
12 
months--4 years (0.09 deaths per 1 million population), followed by an 88% reduction
among children aged 5--9 years 
(0.10 deaths per 1 million population). Deaths among persons aged 
>50 years did not decline to the same extent; however, 
the validity of reported varicella deaths in this age group is low 
(35), and the majority of these deaths are not considered to 
be caused by varicella. During 1999--2001, the average rate of mortality attributed to
varicella among all racial and 
ethnic populations was <0.15 deaths per 1 million persons. Persons without high-risk
conditions (e.g., 
malignancies, HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], and other 
immune deficiencies) accounted for 92% of deaths attributable 
to varicella. The average rates of deaths for which varicella was listed as a contributing
cause of death also 
declined during 1999--2001, compared with 1990--1994. 
Despite high 1-dose vaccination coverage and the success of the vaccination program
in reducing varicella morbidity 
and mortality, reports to CDC from active surveillance sites and from states with 
well-implemented vaccination programs and surveillance indicate that in certain states
and in one 
active surveillance site, the number of reported varicella cases 
has remained constant or declined minimally, and outbreaks have continued to occur.
During 2001--2005, outbreaks 
were reported in schools with high varicella vaccination coverage (range 96%--100%) 
(3,4). The outbreaks were similar in 
certain  respects:  1)  all  occurred  in  elementary  schools,  2)  vaccine  effectiveness  was
similar (range: 72%--85%), 3) the highest 
attack  rates  occurred  among  the  younger  students,  4)  each  outbreak  lasted
approximately 
2  months,  and  5)  index  cases  occurred  among  vaccinated  students  (although  their
disease was mild). Overall attack rates among vaccinated children varied 
(range: 11%--17%), with attack rates in certain classrooms as high as 40%. These data
indicate that even in settings in 
which vaccination coverage was nearly universal and vaccine performed as expected,
the 1-dose vaccination program could 
not prevent varicella outbreaks completely.
Prenatal and Perinatal Exposure
In  the  prevaccine  era,  prenatal  infection  was  uncommon  because  the  majority  of
women of childbearing age 
were immune to VZV (12,36). Varicella in pregnant women is 
associated with a risk for VZV transmission to the fetus or 
newborn.  Intrauterine  VZV  infection  might  result  in  congenital  varicella  syndrome,
neonatal varicella, or HZ during 
infancy or early childhood (37--46). Infants who are 
exposed prenatally to VZV, even if asymptomatic, might have measurable 
varicella-specific
 IgM
 antibody
 during
 the
 newborn
 period,
 have
 persistent
varicella-specific IgG immunity after age 1 year without 
a history of postnatal varicella, or demonstrate positive lymphocyte transformation in
response to VZV antigen 
(37).
Congenital varicella syndrome was first recognized in 1947 
(40). Congenital varicella syndrome can occur among 
infants  born  to  mothers  infected  during  the  first  half  of  pregnancy  and  might  be
manifested by low birthweight, cutaneous 
scarring, limb hypoplasia, microcephaly, cortical atrophy, chorioretinitis, cataracts, and
other anomalies. In one study, incidence 
of congenital varicella syndrome was calculated using aggregate data from nine cohort
studies carried out during 
1986--2002 (47). Rates were 0.6% (4 of 725) for 2--12 weeks' gestation, 1.4% (9 of 642)
for 13--28 weeks, and 0 (0 of 385) after 
28 weeks.
In a prospective study of 1,373 mothers with varicella during pregnancy conducted in
the United Kingdom and 
West  Germany  during  1980--1993,  the  highest  risk  (2%)  for  congenital  varicella
syndrome was observed when maternal 
infection occurred during 13--20 weeks' gestation 
(43). The risk was 0.4% after maternal infection during 0--12 weeks' gestation. 
No cases of congenital varicella syndrome occurred among the infants of 366 mothers
with HZ during pregnancy. Nine 
isolated  cases  involving  birth  defects  consistent  with  congenital  varicella  syndrome
have been reported after maternal varicella 
beyond 20 weeks' gestation (with the latest occurring at 28 weeks) 
(47,48). In a prospective study, HZ occurred 
during infancy or early childhood in four (0.8%) of 477 infants who were exposed to VZV
during 13--24 weeks' gestation and in six (1.7%) 
of 345 infants who were exposed during 25--36 weeks' gestation 
(43).
The onset of varicella in pregnant women from 5 days 
before to 2 days after delivery results in severe varicella infection in 
an  estimated  17%--30%  of  their  newborn  infants.  These  infants  are  exposed  to  VZV
without sufficient maternal 
antibody  to  lessen  the  severity  of  disease.  The  risk  for  neonatal  death  has  been
estimated to be 31% among infants whose mothers 
had onset of rash <4 days before giving birth 
(45). This estimate was made on the basis of a limited number of infant deaths 
and  might  be  higher  than  the  actual  risk  because  the  study  was  performed  before
neonatal intensive care was available. In 
addition,  certain  cases  were  not  part  of  prospective  studies  but  were  reported
retrospectively, making the results subject to selection 
bias. When these cases were reevaluated subsequently by another investigator, certain
infants were demonstrated to have been at 
higher risk for death because of low birthweight; in at least one case, another cause of
death was probable 
(46). Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) has been reported to reduce incidence of
severe neonatal varicella disease 
(49)  and  therefore  is  indicated  in  such  situations.  Nevertheless,  the  risk  for  death
among neonates who do not receive postexposure 
prophylaxis with VZIG is likely to be substantially lower than was estimated previously.
Herpes Zoster Surveillance
After primary infection, VZV persists as a latent infection in sensory-nerve ganglia. The
virus can reactivate, causing 
HZ.  Mechanisms  controlling  VZV  latency  are  not  well  understood.  Risk  factors  for  HZ
include aging, immunosuppression, 
and  initial  infection  with  varicella  in  utero  or  during  early  childhood  (i.e.,  age  <18
months). An estimated 15%--30% of 
the general population experience HZ during their lifetimes 
(50,51); this proportion is likely to increase 
as life expectancy increases. The most common complication of HZ, particularly in older
persons, is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), 
the persistence of sometimes debilitating pain weeks to months after resolution of HZ. 
Life-threatening complications of HZ also can occur; these include herpes ophthalmicus,
which can lead to blindness. Another severe manifestation is 
dissemination,  which  might  involve  generalized  skin  eruptions,  and  central  nervous
system, pulmonary, hepatic, and 
pancreatic complications. Dissemination, pneumonia, and 
visceral involvement typically are restricted to immunocompromised 
persons.  VZV  can  be  transmitted  from  the  lesions  of  patients  who  have  HZ  to
susceptible contacts. Although few data are available 
to assess this risk, one household contact study reported 
that the risk for VZV transmission from HZ was approximately 
20% of the risk for transmission from varicella 
(52).
Varicella vaccination might alter the risk for HZ at the level of both the individual and
the population (i.e., herd 
immunity). Just as wild-type VZV can cause wild-type HZ, attenuated vaccine virus has
the potential to become latent and later reactivate 
to cause vaccine virus strain (also called Oka-strain) HZ 
(53). Multiple studies have evaluated the risk for Oka-strain HZ 
after vaccination of immunocompromised or healthy children 
(54--58). In a study of leukemic children, the rate of HZ after a 
mean 4.1 years of follow-up (range: 6 months--10 years) was 2% in vaccine recipients
and 15% in controls with a history of 
varicella  (54).  A  subset  of  96  of  these  vaccine  recipients  was  matched  prospectively
according to chemotherapeutic protocol with 
96 leukemic children who had experienced natural varicella. Analysis indicated that the
incidence of HZ was 
approximately three times lower in vaccine recipients (0.80 per 100 person-years) than
in the matched leukemic children who had experienced 
natural varicella (2.46 per 100 person-years) (p = 0.01). Data for healthy children are
more limited, and findings might be influenced 
by multiple factors (e.g., incomplete ascertainment, limited duration of follow up or no
follow up of subjects of older ages, 
no comprehensive screening for wild-type varicella infection before or after vaccination,
or lack of testing all cases to distinguish 
Oka- from wild-type HZ). Nonetheless, these studies suggest that the risk for Oka-strain
HZ after a single dose of varicella vaccine 
is lower than that after wild-type varicella infection 
(56--58). Over time, the risk for and manifestation of Oka-strain HZ should 
be examined in older persons who are at greater risk for HZ complications. Persons who
experience varicella infection 
before  vaccination  (i.e.,  as  a  result  of  in  utero  or  unapparent  infection)  or  after
vaccination (i.e., as a result of breakthrough 
infection) presumably are latently infected with two strains of VZV. The risk for HZ in
these persons is unknown. No long-term 
studies have been conducted that compare the risk for Oka-strain HZ in persons who
receive 1 dose of varicella vaccine with the risk 
for those who receive 2 doses.
Varicella vaccination also might change the risk for HZ at the population level. With the
development of herd 
immunity and reduction in the likelihood of exposure, the varicella vaccination program
prevents wild-type VZV infection 
among vaccine recipients and nonvaccine recipients, eliminating the risk for wild-type
HZ in these persons. Reduction in 
the likelihood of wild-type varicella infection also increases the 
median age for acquiring varicella (although age-specific 
incidence  rates  themselves  are  lower).  This  reduces  the  risk  for  varicella  infection
during early childhood (i.e., age <18 months), 
thereby reducing a risk factor for childhood HZ.
Exposure  of  persons  with  latent  wild-type  VZV  infection  to  persons  with  varicella  is
thought to boost specific 
immunity,  which  might  contribute  to  controlling  reactivation  of  VZV  and  the
development of HZ 
(50).  Concern  has  been  expressed  that  by  providing  fewer  opportunities  for  varicella
exposure among persons with previous wild-type varicella 
infection, reduction in the likelihood of exposure might 
increase the risk for HZ, possibly within as few as 5 years after introduction of 
varicella vaccination (59) and reaching a vaccination 
coverage of >90%.
Herpes  zoster  is  not  a  nationally  notifiable  disease  in  the  United  States,  and  HZ
surveillance has been conducted 
using multiple methods, study sites, or data sources. For certain studies, baseline data
were available before the start of the 
varicella  vaccination  program.  One  study  that  included  baseline  data  was  a
retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from 
a health maintenance organization (HMO) during 1992--2002 
(60). This HMO study indicated that age-adjusted incidence 
of HZ remained stable during 1992--2002 as incidence of 
varicella decreased (60). Age-adjusted and -specific 
annual incidence rates of HZ fluctuated slightly over time; the age-adjusted rate was
highest in 1992, at 4.1 cases per 1,000 
person-years,  and  was  3.7  cases  per  1,000  person-years  in  2002.  For  other  studies
initiated in the postvaccine era, baseline data are 
not  available  (61--63).  An  analysis  of  national  incidence  data  from  the  Medstat
database (available at 
http://www.medstat.com/Products/view/?id=71) demonstrated 
an overall incidence of HZ in 2000 and 2001 of 3.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
= 3.1--3.2) per 1,000 person-years (61), representing no increase in age-adjusted HZ in
the past 20 years in the United 
States compared with earlier published data 
(64). Data from two HMOs in Oregon and Washington for 1997--2003 indicated 
no statistically significant increase in HZ incidence rates except among 
children aged 10--17 years (relative risk [RR] = 1.12, CI 
= 1.05--1.18); these increases were attributed to increased use of oral steroids 
(62).  Another  study  of  data  gathered  from  a  statewide  telephone  survey  during
1999--2003 in Massachusetts demonstrated an increase in HZ 
(63).  Age  groups  particularly  affected  included  persons  aged  25--44  years  and  those
aged >65 years. Finally, in the two active varicella surveillance 
sites  (Antelope  Valley,  California,  and  West  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania),  active
surveillance for HZ in children aged <20 years 
has been ongoing since 2000. During 2000--2004, incidence of HZ in children aged <10
years declined significantly 
(p<0.05) from 0.75 to 0.23 cases per 1,000 children 
(65; CDC unpublished data, 2006). In summary, multiple studies and 
surveillance data demonstrate no consistent trends in HZ incidence in the United States
since implementation of the varicella 
vaccination program in 1995.
Use of Acyclovir to Treat and Prevent Varicella
Acyclovir  is  a  synthetic  nucleoside  analog  that  inhibits  replication  of  human  herpes
viruses, including VZV. Since the 
early  1980s,  intravenous  acyclovir  has  been  available  to  treat  immunocompromised
persons who have varicella. 
When administered within 24 hours of onset of rash, acyclovir has been demonstrated
to be effective in reducing 
varicella-associated morbidity and mortality in this population 
(66--68).
In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved the use of oral acyclovir for the treatment of varicella 
in
 otherwise
 healthy
 children.
 This
 approval
 was
 made
 on
 the
 basis
 of
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies 
(69,70) that demonstrated the beneficial clinical effects (i.e., a decrease in the number
of days in which new lesions appeared, the 
duration of fever, and the severity of cutaneous and systemic signs and symptoms) that
occurred when acyclovir was 
administered within 24 hours of rash onset. No serious adverse events occurred during
the period of drug 
administration. Administration of acyclovir did not decrease transmission of varicella or
reduce the duration of absence from school. Because few 
complications occurred (1%--2%), these studies could not determine whether acyclovir
had a statistically significant effect on disease 
severity  among  healthy  children.  In  these  studies,  antibody  titers  after  infection  in
children receiving acyclovir did not 
differ substantially from titers of children in the control group 
(69,70). Clinical trials among adolescents and adults have 
indicated that acyclovir is well-tolerated and effective in 
reducing the duration and severity of clinical illness if the drug is 
administered within 24 hours of rash onset 
(71--73).
In 1993, AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases published a statement 
regarding the use of acyclovir (74). AAP did 
not  consider  administration  of  acyclovir  to  healthy  children  to  have  clinical  benefit
sufficient to justify its routine 
administration;  however,  AAP  stated  that  certain  circumstances  might  justify  its  use.
AAP recommended that oral acyclovir should 
be considered for otherwise healthy persons at increased risk for moderate to severe
varicella (e.g., persons aged >12 years, 
persons with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders, persons 
receiving long-term salicylate therapy, and persons receiving 
short,  intermittent,  or  aerosolized  courses  of  corticosteroids).  Certain  experts  also
recommend use of oral acyclovir 
for secondary case-patients who live in the same households as infected children 
(74).
Acyclovir is classified as a Category B drug in the FDA 
use-in-pregnancy rating. Although studies involving animals 
have  not  indicated  teratogenic  effects,  adequate,  well-controlled  studies  in  pregnant
women have not been conducted. 
However, a prospective registry of acyclovir use during pregnancy that collected data
on outcomes of 596 infants whose mothers 
were  exposed  to  systemic  acyclovir  during  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  indicated
that the rate and types of birth 
defects 
approximated those in the general population 
(75). AAP has not recommended routine use of oral acyclovir for 
pregnant  women  because  the  risks  and  benefits  to  the  fetus  and  mother  were
unknown. However, in instances of serious, 
viral-mediated
 complications
 (e.g.,
 pneumonia),
 AAP
 has
 recommended
 that
intravenous acyclovir should be considered 
(74).
Two  nucleoside  analogs,  acyclovir  and  famciclovir,  have  been  approved  by  FDA  for
treating HZ. If administered within 
72  hours  of  rash  onset,  acyclovir  has  accelerated  the  rate  of  cutaneous  healing  and
reduced the severity of acute pain in adults 
who have HZ (76). Oral famciclovir, when administered 
during the same period, has similar efficacy 
(77).
Acyclovir is not indicated for prophylactic use among 
otherwise healthy children, adolescents, or adults without evidence 
of  immunity  after  exposure  to  varicella.  Vaccination  is  the  method  of  choice  in  these
situations. No studies have been 
conducted  regarding  prophylactic  use  of  acyclovir  among  immunocompromised
persons; therefore, VZIG is recommended in 
these situations.
Vaccines for Prevention of Varicella
Two  live  attenuated  varicella  virus  vaccines  are  licensed  in  the  United  States  for
prevention of varicella: 
single-antigen varicella vaccine 
(VARIVAX,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) and combination MMRV
vaccine  (ProQuad,®  Merck  &  Co.,  Inc.,  Whitehouse,  New  Jersey).  Both  vaccines  are
derived from the Oka strain of live, 
attenuated VZV. The Oka strain was isolated in Japan 
(78) in the early 1970s from vesicular fluid in a healthy child who had 
natural  varicella  and  was  attenuated  through  sequential  propagation  in  cultures  of
human embryonic lung cells, 
embryonic guinea-pig cells, and human diploid cells (WI-38). The virus in the Oka/Merck
vaccine has undergone further passage through 
human diploid-cell cultures (MRC-5) for a total of 31 passages.
In 1995, the single-antigen varicella vaccine was licensed in the United States for use
among healthy persons aged 
>12 months. This vaccine is lyophilized; when reconstituted as directed in the package
insert and stored at room temperature for 
a maximum of 30 minutes, it contains a minimum of 1,350 plaque forming units (PFUs)
of Oka/Merck VZV in each 0.5 
mL dose (79). Each dose also contains 12.5 mg of hydrolyzed gelatin, trace amounts of
neomycin and fetal bovine serum, 25 
mg  of  sucrose,  and  trace  residual  components  of  MRC-5  cells  (including  DNA  and
protein). The vaccine does 
not contain preservatives. Since 1995, >55 million doses have been distributed in the
United States. Reporting of serious 
adverse events has been rare (see Vaccine-Associated Adverse Events).
In  2005,  the  combination  MMRV  vaccine  was  licensed  in  the  United  States  for  use
among healthy children aged 
12 months--12 years. The attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine viruses in 
ProQuad® are identical and of equal titer 
to those in the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, 
MMRII® (80). The titer of Oka/Merck VZV is higher in 
MMRV than in single-antigen varicella vaccine, a minimum of 3.99 
log10 PFUs compared with 1,350 PFUs (approximately 
3.13  log10)  in  each  0.5  mL  dose.  The  other  constituents  are  similar  to  those  in  the
single-antigen varicella vaccine.
Immune Response to Vaccination
In  clinical  trials  of  the  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  conducted  before  licensure,
seroconversion was assessed using lots 
of vaccine with different amounts of PFUs and laboratory 
assays with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. Using 
a  specially  developed,  sensitive  gp-enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  test
that is not available 
commercially,  seroconversion  (defined  by  the  acquisition  of  any  detectable  varicella
antibodies >0.3 gpELISA units) was 
observed at approximately 4--6 weeks after vaccination with 
1 dose of varicella vaccine in approximately 97% of 6,889 
susceptible  children  aged  1--12  years  (79).  The  seroconversion  rate  was  98%  for
children aged 12--15 months and 95% among those 
aged 5--12 years (81). Adolescents aged 13--17 years had a lower seroconversion rate
(79%) after a single dose of vaccine. A 
study performed postlicensure used fluorescent antibody 
to membrane antigen (FAMA) titers 16 weeks after vaccination to 
assess serologic response and demonstrated that 61 (76%) of 80 healthy child vaccine
recipients seroconverted (FAMA titers 
>1:4) after 1 dose of single-antigen varicella 
vaccine (82).
Primary antibody response to the vaccine at 6 weeks postvaccination is correlated with
protection against disease 
(83,84). In clinical trials, rates of breakthrough disease were lower among children with
varicella antibody titers of 
>5 gpELISA units than among those with titers of <5 units 
(84); children with a 6-week postvaccination antibody titer of <5 gpELISA units were 
3.5 times more likely to have breakthrough varicella than those with a titer of 
>5 gpELISA units. Later studies of 
immunogenicity 
(85)  have  reported  the  proportion  of  vaccinated  children  who  achieved  this  antibody
level 
instead of seroconversion. After 1 dose of the 
single-antigen varicella vaccine, 86% of children had gpELISA levels of 
>5 units/mL (85). Studies performed 
using FAMA indicated that a titer >1:4 at 16 weeks postvaccination is correlated with
protection against disease 
(82). Of healthy persons with a titer of >1:4 at 16 weeks post vaccination, <1% have
had varicella after a household exposure (n = 130). 
In contrast, the attack rate among those with a titer of <1:4 was 55% (n = 60).
Persistence of antibody in children after 1 dose of single-antigen varicella vaccine was
demonstrated in both short- and 
long-term  follow-up  studies.  In  a  clinical  study,  the  rate  of  antibody  persistence
detected by gpELISA was nearly 100% after 9 
years  of  follow-up  for  277  children  (85).  Another  study  demonstrated  that  although
antibody titers (detected by FAMA) 
might  decline  12--24  months  after  vaccination,  the  median  titer  did  not  change  after
1--4 years and even rose after 10 years 
(86).  In  Japan,  VZV  antibodies  were  present  in  37  (97%)  of  38  children  who  received
varicella vaccine 7--10 years earlier (with 
titers comparable to those of 29 children who had had natural varicella infection within
the previous 10 years) 
(87) and in 100% of 25 children when followed for as long as 20 years (i.e., antibody
levels were higher than those observed 10 years earlier) 
(88).  Interpretation  of  long-term  studies  is  complicated  by  at  least  two  factors.  First,
asymptomatic boosting of 
vaccine-induced  immunity  by  exposure  to  wild-type  VZV  is  likely.  Because  varicella
vaccine is not routinely recommended in Japan, 
coverage of children was estimated to be low (approximately 20%) during 1991--1993.
Second, sample sizes were limited as a result 
of  the  decrease  in  the  number  of  children  followed-up  with  increasing  time  since
vaccination.
The  second  dose  of  varicella  vaccine  in  children  produced  an  improved  immunologic
response that is correlated 
with improved protection. A comparative study of healthy children who received 1 or 2
doses of single-antigen varicella 
vaccine  administered  3  months  apart  indicated  that  a  second  dose  provided  higher
antibody levels as measured by the proportion 
of subjects with titers of >5 gpELISA units and by 
geometric mean titers (GMTs) and higher efficacy 
(85; Tables 2--4). The proportion of subjects with antibody titers of 
>5 gpELISA units in the 2-dose recipients was higher 6 weeks after the 
second  dose  than  after  the  first  dose  (99.6%  and  85.7%,  respectively)  and  remained
high at the end of the 9-year follow-up 
period,  although  the  difference  between  the  two  regimens  narrowed  (97%  and  95%,
respectively). GMT 6 weeks after the 
second  dose  was  substantially  higher  than  that  after  a  single  dose  (142  and  12,
respectively). The difference in GMTs between the 
two  regimens  did  not  persist  over  9  years  of  follow-up  among  subjects  who
seroconverted after vaccination, although GMTs 
in both regimens remained high by the end of the study period. However, receipt of a
second dose decreased the rate 
of  breakthrough  varicella  significantly  (3.3-fold)  and  increased  vaccine  efficacy
(p<0.001). Another study that assessed 
the  immunogenicity  of  a  second  dose  received  4--6  years  after  the  first  dose
demonstrated a substantial increase in antibody 
levels in the first 7--10 days in the majority of those tested, indicating an anamnestic
response. On the day of the second dose, 
GMT  was  25.7,  compared  with  143.6  GMT  7--10  days  after  the  second  dose;  60%  of
recipients had at least a fourfold increase 
in antibody titers, and an additional 17% had at least a twofold increase 
(89). Three months after the second dose, 
GMT remained higher than on the day of second dose (119.0 and 25.7, respectively).
Among children, VZV antibody levels 
and GMTs after 2 doses administered 4--6 years apart were comparable to those 
obtained when the 2 doses were administered 3 months apart.
The  combination  MMRV  vaccine  was  licensed  on  the  basis  of  noninferiority  of
immunogenicity of the 
antigenic  components  compared  with  MMR  and  varicella  vaccines  administered
concomitantly at separate inspection sites rather 
than  on  clinical  efficacy  (80).  Clinical  studies  of  healthy  children  aged  12--23  months
indicated that those who received 1 dose 
of  MMRV  vaccine  had  levels  of  antibody  to  measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella
similar to levels of children who received 
1  dose  of  MMR  and  1  dose  of  varicella  vaccines  concomitantly  at  separate  injection
sites. For the varicella component 
in MMRV, 91.2% (CI = 87.0%--94.4%) of children achieved antibody titers of 
>5 gpELISA units/mL 6 weeks after 
vaccination  (90).  A  subgroup  of  children  received  a  second  dose  of  MMRV  vaccine
approximately 3 months after the first dose. 
The  serologic  response  (>5  gpELISA  units/mL)  after  2  doses  was  99.2%  (CI  =
97.0%--99.9%) (Table 2). Also, GMT for 
varicella after the second dose of MMRV vaccine increased approximately 
forty-onefold (90). Administration of combination 
MMRV vaccine to healthy children aged 4--6 years who had been vaccinated previously
with MMR and single-antigen 
varicella vaccines resulted in similar antibody levels and a 
twenty-fivefold increase in GMT levels (91).
Among persons aged >13 years, multiple studies have 
described seroconversion rates after receipt of the 
single-antigen varicella vaccine (range: 72%--94% after 1 dose and 94%--99% after a
second dose administered 4--8 weeks 
later)  (79,92,93).  In  clinical  studies,  detectable  antibody  levels  have  persisted  for  at
least 5 years in 97% of adolescents and 
adults who were administered 2 doses of vaccine 4--8 weeks apart 
(79). However, other studies demonstrated that 25%--31% 
of 
adult  vaccine  recipients  who  seroconverted  lost  detectable  antibodies  (by  FAMA)  at
multiple intervals (range: 1--11 
years)  after  vaccination  (93,94).  For  persons  who  had  breakthrough  disease  after
exposure to varicella, the severity of illness or 
the attack rates did not increase over time 
(95).
Innate  (i.e.,  nonspecific)  and  adaptive  (i.e.,  humoral  and  cellular)  immunity  are
important in the control of primary 
varicella  infection.  The  capacity  to  elicit  cell-mediated  immunity  is  important  for  viral
clearance, providing 
long-term  protection  against  disease  and  preventing  symptomatic  VZV  reactivation.
Studies among children and adults have 
indicated that breakthrough varicella typically is mild, even among vaccine recipients
without seroconversion or vaccine recipients 
who lost detectable antibody, suggesting that VZV-specific 
cell-mediated immunity affords protection to vaccine recipients in 
the absence of a detectable antibody response 
(94,95). Studies of the cellular immune response to vaccination among 
children demonstrated that immunization with 1 
dose of varicella vaccine induced VZV-specific T-cell proliferation that 
was maintained in 26 (90%) of 29 children 1 year postvaccination and in 52 (87%) of 60
children 5 years postvaccination 
(96). In this study, the mean stimulation index (SI), a marker of cell-mediated immunity,
was 12.1 after 
1 year and 22.1 after 5 years. Data obtained at 1 year postvaccination from a subset of
children in a prelicensure study comparing the immune 
response  among  children  who  received  1  and  2  doses  administered  3  months  apart
demonstrated that the 
varicella-specific  lymphocyte  proliferation  responses  were  significantly  higher  for
recipients of 2 doses than for recipients of 1 dose (mean SI: 34.7 and 
23.1, respectively; p = 0.03) (97). In the study of the 2 doses administered 4--6 years
apart, results also indicated that 
the lymphocyte proliferation response was significantly higher at 6 weeks and 3 months
after the second dose than at the 
same time points after the first dose (p<0.01) 
(89; Table 2).
Among  adults,  vaccine-induced  VZV-specific  T-cell  proliferation  was  maintained  in  16
(94%) of 17 subjects 1 and 5 
years postvaccination (96,98). The mean SI was 9.9 after 1 year and 22.4 after 5 years.
Correlates of Protection 
For  children,  the  varicella  antibody  response  measured  by  gpELISA  6  weeks
postvaccination correlates with 
neutralizing antibody level, VZV-specific T-cell proliferative responses, vaccine efficacy,
and long-term protection against varicella 
after exposure to VZV (83,84,99,100). A titer of 
>5 gpELISA units/mL is associated with protection against disease although 
it  should  not  be  considered  an  absolute  guarantee  of  protection.  Breakthrough  cases
have occurred among children with 
>5 gpELISA units/mL. A FAMA titer 
>1:4 at 16 weeks post-vaccination also correlates with protection against disease 
(82).  However,  neither  of  these  antibody  tests  is  available  commercially.  The
relationship between the antibody level measured 
at other intervals postvaccination, especially immediately prior to 
exposure and breakthrough disease has not been studied. 
No correlates of protection have been evaluated for adults.
Vaccine Efficacy and Vaccine Effectiveness
One-Dose Regimen
Prelicensure Efficacy
In prelicensure studies carried out among children aged 
12 months--14 years, the protective efficacy of 
single-antigen varicella vaccine varied, depending on the amount of live 
virus administered per dose, the exposure setting (community 
or household), and the quality and length of the clinical follow-up. The majority of the
prelicensure studies reported efficacy of 
1 dose of varicella vaccine within the range of 70%--90% against any clinical disease
and 95% against severe disease for 
7--10  years  after  vaccination  (81,101,102).  A  randomized  placebo-controlled  efficacy
trial was conducted among children aged 
12  months--14  years,  but  the  formulation  differed  from  that  of  the  current  vaccine
(17,000 PFUs per dose 
(103,104), with follow-up of children through 7 years postvaccination 
(105). Reported efficacy was 100% at 1 year and 98% at 2 years 
after  vaccination,  and  100%  and  92%,  respectively,  after  exposures  to  VZV  that
occurred in the household. Although a 
randomized control study was not conducted for adults, the efficacy of single-antigen
varicella vaccine was 
determined by evaluation of protection when adult vaccine recipients were exposed to
varicella in the household. On the basis of the reported 
historical 
attack rate of 87% for natural varicella after household exposure among unvaccinated
children, estimated efficacy 
among  adults  was  approximately  80%  (79).  The  attack  rate  of  unvaccinated  adults
exposed in households was not studied.
Postlicensure Efficacy and Effectiveness
Prevention of All Varicella Disease
Postlicensure studies have assessed the 
effectiveness¶ of the single-antigen varicella vaccine under field conditions in 
child  care,  school,  household,  and  community  settings  using  multiple  methods.
Effectiveness frequently has been estimated 
against all varicella and also against moderate and severe varicella (defined in different
ways). Outbreak investigations 
have assessed effectiveness against clinically defined varicella. The majority of these
investigations have demonstrated 
vaccine effectiveness for prevention of varicella in the same range 
described in prelicensure trials (70%--90%) 
(3--6,106--113), with some lower (44%, 56%) 
(114,115) and some higher (100% in one of two schools investigated) estimates 
(107).  A  retrospective  cohort  study  in  11  childcare  centers  demonstrated  vaccine
effectiveness of 83% for prevention of 
clinically  diagnosed  varicella  (116).  In  a  case-control  study  that  measured  vaccine
effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed varicella 
in  a  pediatric  office  setting  during  1997--2003,  vaccine  effectiveness  was  85%  (CI  =
78%--90%) during the first four years 
and 87% (CI = 81%--91%) for the entire study period 
(117,118). Finally, in a study of household secondary attack 
rates, considered the most robust test of vaccine performance because of the intensity
of exposure, varicella vaccine was 79% (CI 
= 70%--85%) effective in preventing clinically defined varicella in exposed household
contacts aged 12 months--14 
years without a history of varicella disease or vaccination 
(119). Postlicensure data on vaccine effectiveness against all disease 
have been summarized (Table 5).
In a randomized clinical trial conducted postlicensure that compared the efficacy of 1
dose of varicella vaccine with that of 
2 doses, the estimated vaccine efficacy for 1 dose for a 
10-year observation period was 94.4% (CI = 92.9%--95.7%) 
(85;  Table  3).  In  the  same  study,  the  efficacy  of  1  dose  of  vaccine  in  preventing
varicella after household exposure for 10 years was 
90.2% (CI = 83.7%--96.7%) (Table 4). This study did not use placebo controls and used
historic data for attack rates 
in unvaccinated children to calculate vaccine 
efficacy. 
Prevention of Moderate and Severe Varicella
Postlicensure studies assessing vaccine performance in 
preventing moderate and severe varicella have 
consistently demonstrated high effectiveness. Definitions for disease 
severity have varied among studies. Certain studies have used 
a defined scale of illness that included the number of skin 
lesions, fever, complications, and investigator assessment of 
illness severity, and others have used only the number of skin 
lesions, reported complications, or hospitalizations. 
Moderate varicella typically has been defined as either 50--500 or 250--500 lesions, and
severe varicella has been defined as >500 lesions or 
any hospitalization or complication. In the randomized postlicensure clinical trial, severe
varicella was defined as >300 lesions 
and fever of >102°F (38.9°C), oral equivalent. 
Regardless of different definitions, multiple studies have 
demonstrated that single-antigen varicella vaccine was>>95% effective in preventing
combined moderate and severe disease 
(3--6,85,106,107,109--113,115--119); one study demonstrated effectiveness of 86% 
(114). Effectiveness was 100% against severe disease 
when measured separately 
(6,85,109,111,117,119). Postlicensure data on vaccine effectiveness against moderate
and severe 
varicella have been summarized (Table 5).
Two-Dose Regimen
In  a  randomized  clinical  trial  of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  that  compared  the
efficacy of 1 dose with that of 2 
doses  administered  3  months  apart,  the  estimated  vaccine  efficacy  of  2  doses  for  a
10-year observation period was 98.3% (CI 
= 97.3%--99.0%), which was significantly higher than efficacy after 1 dose (p<0.001) 
(85; Table 5). The 2-dose regimen also was 100% efficacious against severe varicella. In
the same study, the efficacy of 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine 
in  preventing  disease  after  household  exposure  over  10  years  was  96.4%  (CI  =
92.4%--100%), not significantly different from 
1  dose  (90.2%)  (p  =  0.112)  (Table  4).  However,  the  number  of  cases  involving
household exposure was limited.
Formal studies to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination MMRV vaccine have
not been performed. Efficacy of 
the  individual  components  was  established  previously  in  clinical  studies  with  the
single-antigen vaccines.
Breakthrough Disease
Breakthrough disease is defined as a case of infection with wild-type VZV occurring >42
days after vaccination. In 
clinical trials, varicella disease was substantially less severe among vaccinated persons
than among unvaccinated persons, who 
usually have fever and several hundred vesicular lesions 
(120). In cases of breakthrough disease, the median number of skin lesions 
is commonly <50 (99,121--123). In addition, 
compared with unvaccinated persons, vaccine recipients have had fewer 
vesicular  lesions  (lesions  more  commonly  are  atypical,  with  papules  that  do  not
progress to vesicles), shorter 
duration of illness, and lower incidence of fever.
Multiple  postlicensure  investigations  also  have  demonstrated  that  the  majority  of
breakthrough varicella cases 
are significantly milder than cases among unvaccinated children (p<0.05) 
(3,5,107--114,116--118,124). However, 
approximately  25%--30%  of  breakthrough  cases  are  not  mild,  with  clinical  features
more similar to those in unvaccinated children 
(124). Since 1999, when varicella deaths became nationally notifiable, two deaths from
breakthrough varicella disease have 
been  reported  to  CDC;  one  of  a  girl  aged  9  years  with  a  history  of  asthma  who  was
receiving steroids when she had 
the  breakthrough  infection,  and  the  other  of  a  girl  aged  7  years  with  a  history  of
malignant ependymoma who also was 
under steroid therapy at the time of her death (CDC, unpublished data, 2006).
One-Dose Regimen
In clinical trials, 1,114 children aged 1--12 years received 
1 dose of single-antigen varicella vaccine containing 
2,900--9,000 PFUs of attenuated virus per dose and were actively followed for up to 10
years postvaccination 
(79).  Among  a  subset  of  95  vaccine  recipients  with  household  exposure  to  varicella,
eight (8%) reported a mild form of varicella (10--34 lesions).
In a randomized clinical trial that compared the efficacy of 1 dose of vaccine to that of 2
doses during a 10-year 
observation period, the cumulative rate of breakthrough varicella among children who
received 1 dose was 7.3% 
(85).  Breakthrough  cases  occurred  annually  in  0.2%--2.3%  of  recipients  of  1  dose  of
vaccine. Cases occurred throughout the observation period, 
but the majority were reported 2--5 years after vaccination (Figure 4). Of 57 children
with breakthrough cases, 13 (23%) had 
>50 lesions.
In cross-sectional studies, the attack rate for breakthrough disease has ranged between
11% and 17% (and as high as 40% 
in certain classrooms) in outbreak investigations 
(3) and 15% in household settings 
(119).
Two-Dose Regimen
Data Among Children
In a randomized clinical trial that compared the efficacy of 1 dose of vaccine with that
of 2 doses, the cumulative rate 
of breakthrough varicella during a 10-year observation period was 3.3-fold lower among
children who received 2 doses than 
that among children who received 1 dose (2.2% and 7.3, 
respectively; p<0.001) (85). Breakthrough cases occurred 
occasionally in 0.8% of 2-dose vaccine recipients. The 
majority of cases of breakthrough disease occurred 2--5 years after vaccination; no 
cases  were  reported  7--10  years  after  vaccination  (Figure  4).  Of  16  children  with
breakthrough cases, three (19%) had >50 
lesions. The proportion of children with >50 lesions did not differ between the 1-dose
and 2-dose 
regimens (p = 0.5).
Breakthrough Infections Among Adolescents and Adults
In postlicensure studies of adolescents and adults who 
received 2 doses, 40 (9%) cases of breakthrough 
varicella occurred among 461 vaccine recipients who were followed for 8 weeks--11.8
years (mean: 3.3 years) after vaccination 
(95), and 12 (10%) cases occurred among 120 vaccine recipients who were followed for
1 month--20.6 years (mean: 4.6 
years) (94). One prelicensure study of persons who had 
received 2 doses of vaccine reported that 12 (8%) breakthrough cases 
had occurred among 152 vaccine recipients who were followed for 5--66 months (mean:
30 months) postvaccination 
(93).
Contagiousness
Prelicensure  clinical  trials  reported  the  rate  of  disease  transmission  from  vaccinated
persons with varicella cases to 
their  vaccinated  siblings.  In  10  trials  that  were  conducted  during  1981--1989,
breakthrough infections occurred in 114 (5.3%) 
of 2,163 vaccinated children during the 1--8 year follow-up period of active surveillance,
and secondary transmission occurred 
to 11 (12.2%) of their 90 vaccinated siblings 
(121). Illness was mild in both index and secondary case-patients. 
Household 
transmission from a vaccinated child with breakthrough disease to a susceptible adult
(one of whom died) have been 
reported (CDC, unpublished data, 2006). One study examined secondary attack rates
from vaccinated and unvaccinated persons 
with  varicella  to  both  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  households  contacts  aged  12
months--14 years 
(119). This study demonstrated that vaccinated persons with varicella with <50 lesions
were only one third as contagious as unvaccinated persons 
with varicella. However, vaccinated persons with varicella who had 
>50 lesions were as contagious as unvaccinated persons 
with varicella (119). Vaccinated persons with varicella tend to have milder disease, and,
although they are less contagious 
than  unvaccinated  persons  with  varicella,  they  might  not  receive  a  diagnosis  and  be
isolated. As a result, they might have 
more opportunities to infect others in community settings, thereby further contributing
to VZV transmission. Vaccinated 
persons with varicella also have been index case-patients in varicella outbreaks 
(3,4,115).
Risk Factors for Vaccine Failure
Potential  risk  factors  for  vaccine  failure  have  been  identified  in  studies  of  vaccine
effectiveness during outbreak 
investigations and other specially designed studies 
(5,108--110,113--115,118,125). In outbreak investigations, the low number of 
cases limits the ability of researchers to conduct multivariate analyses and examine the
independent effect of each risk factor 
for  vaccine  failure.  An  increased  risk  for  breakthrough  disease  has  been  noted  with
decreasing age at vaccination, with a 
threefold  increase  in  breakthrough  disease  risk  for  children  vaccinated  at  age  <14
months 
(110), an increase of twofold in one study 
and nearly fourfold in another for children vaccinated at age <16 months 
(108,115), and a ninefold increase for 
children vaccinated at age <19 months 
(113). Other outbreak investigations have demonstrated that time since vaccination 
(variably defined as >3, >5, or 
>5 years) was associated with an increased risk for breakthrough disease (relative risk
[RR] = 2.6, 6.7, 
and  2.6,  respectively)  (5,114,115).  However,  age  at  vaccination  and  time  since
vaccination are highly correlated, and 
their independent association with the risk for breakthrough disease has been assessed
in only one outbreak investigation 
(113).  A  retrospective  cohort  study  that  adjusted  for  other  potential  risk  factors
demonstrated an increased risk for breakthrough 
disease for children vaccinated at age <15 months (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.4;
CI = 1.1%--1.9%) 
(125). A case-control study demonstrated that the effectiveness of vaccine in the first
year after vaccination was significantly lower (73%) among 
children vaccinated at age <15 months than it was among children vaccinated at age 
>15 months (99%) (p = 0.01) (118). However, 
the difference in the overall effectiveness between children vaccinated at these ages
was not statistically significant for 
subsequent years (8 years of follow-up) (81% and 88%, respectively; p = 0.17). Active
surveillance data collected during 1995--2004 
from a sentinel population of 350,000 persons were analyzed to 
determine whether the severity and annual incidence 
of breakthrough varicella cases increased with time since vaccination 
(126). Children vaccinated >5 years previously were 
2.6 times more likely to have moderate and severe breakthrough 
varicella than those vaccinated <5 years previously (p = 
0.016). The annual rates of breakthrough varicella among children aged 12 months--12
years increased significantly with time 
since vaccination after adjusting for the effects of age at infection, age at vaccination,
and year of infection (p<0.01).
Multiple other studies that examined possible reasons for lower vaccine effectiveness
did not find age at vaccination 
(3--5,111,114) or time since vaccination 
(3,110,111) to be associated with vaccine failure. An ongoing study is examining 
these factors and risk for vaccine failure 
(127). After 8 years of active follow-up of 7,449 children vaccinated at age 12--23 
months,  results  do  not  indicate  an  increased  risk  for  breakthrough  disease  among
children vaccinated at age 12--14 months 
compared  with  those  vaccinated  at  age  15--23  months.  Moreover,  a  test  for  trend
revealed no change in the rate of 
reported breakthrough disease for each additional month of age at vaccination 
(127).
Two  outbreak  investigations  noted  an  increased  risk  for  breakthrough  disease  in
children with asthma and 
eczema  (109,113).  In  these  investigations,  the  use  of  steroids  to  treat  asthma  or
eczema was not studied. Steroids have been 
associated previously with severe varicella in unvaccinated persons 
(128--130). Only one retrospective cohort study 
controlled  simultaneously  for  the  effect  of  multiple  risk  factors,  including  the  use  of
steroids, and this study demonstrated no 
association of risk for breakthrough disease with asthma or eczema 
(125). However, this study documented an increased risk 
for  breakthrough  disease  if  the  child  had  received  a  prescription  of  oral  steroids
(considered a proxy for taking oral steroids 
when exposed to varicella) within 3 months of breakthrough disease (adjusted RR [aRR]
= 2.4; CI = 1.3%--4.4%) and 
when varicella vaccination was administered within 28 days of MMR vaccine (aRR = 3.1;
CI = 1.5%--6.4%).
Evidence of Immunity
ACIP has approved criteria for evidence of immunity to varicella (Box). Only doses of
varicella vaccines for which 
written documentation of the date of administration is presented should be considered
valid. Neither a self-reported dose nor a 
history of vaccination provided by a parent is, by itself, considered adequate evidence
of immunity. Persons who lack 
documentation of adequate vaccination or other evidence of 
immunity should be vaccinated.
Historically, self-reporting of varicella disease by adults or by parents for their children
has been considered valid evidence 
of  immunity.  The  predictive  value  of  a  self-reported  positive  disease  history  was
extremely high in adults in the prevaccine 
era although data on positive predictive value are lacking in parental reports regarding
their children 
(131--133).  As  disease  incidence  decreases  and  the  proportion  of  vaccinated  persons
with varicella having mild cases increases, varicella will be 
less  readily  recognized  clinically.  A  recent  study  demonstrated  that  only  75%  of
unvaccinated children aged 12 
months--4 years who reported a positive history of 
varicella were in fact immune (confirmed by serological testing), compared with 89% 
of children aged 5--9 years and 10--14 years 
(134). To limit the number of false-positive 
reports and ensure immunity, ACIP recommends that evidence of immunity should be
either a diagnosis of varicella by a health-care provider or a 
health-care provider verification of a history of disease rather than parental or 
self-reporting. The above-cited study demonstrated 
that 99% of persons aged 15--19 years and 100% of those aged 20--29 years who 
reported a history of varicella were immune 
(134). Because serologic evidence of VZV infection 
has been documented in 96%--97% of U.S.-born adults aged 20--29 
years and in 97%--99% of adults aged >30 years tested during 1998--1999 
(12), U.S. birth before 1980 is considered evidence 
of  immunity  except  for  health-care  personnel  (HCP),  pregnant  women,  and
immunocomprised persons. For these three 
groups,  certainty  regarding  immunity  is  desirable  because  of  the  possibility  of
nosocomial transmission to 
high-risk  patients;  transmission  of  the  virus  to  the  fetus,  which  might  result  in
congenital 
varicella  syndrome;  and  the  possibility  of  severe  disease.  Postvaccination  serologic
testing to verify an immune response to varicella vaccine is not 
routinely  recommended  because  available  commercial  assays  lack  sensitivity  in
detecting vaccine-induced immunity and might give 
false negative results.
Simultaneous Administration of Vaccines
Single-antigen varicella vaccine is well-tolerated and effective in healthy children aged 
>12  months  when  administered  simultaneously  with  MMR  vaccine  either  at  separate
sites and with separate syringes or separately 
>4  weeks  apart.  The  number  and  types  of  adverse  events  occurring  in  children  who
have received VARIVAX and MMRII concurrently have not 
differed from those in children who have been administered the vaccines at different
visits 
(79,135).  Data  concerning  the  effect  of  simultaneous  administration  of  VARIVAX  with
vaccines containing various combinations of MMR, diphtheria and 
tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP), and Haemophilus 
influenzae type b (Hib) have not been published 
(79).  A  randomized  study  of  694  subjects  determined  that  the  immune  response  to
MMR, varicella, and Hib vaccines administered concurrently with 
a fourth dose of pneumococal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was not inferior to that of those
vaccines when administered 
without PCV7; the percentage of subjects who seroconverted was >90% for all antigens
for both groups 
(136).
Concomitant administration of the combination MMRV vaccine with other vaccines also
has been assessed. In a 
clinical  trial  involving  1,913  healthy  children  aged  12--15  months,  three  groups  were
compared 
(137).  One  group  received  concomitantly  administered  (at  separate  sites)  MMRV
vaccine, Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular 
Pertussis Vaccine Absorbed (DTaP), Hib conjugate (meningococcal 
protein conjugate) vaccine, and hepatitis B (recombinant) (Hep 
B)  vaccine.  The  second  group  received  MMRV  vaccine  at  the  initial  visit,  followed  by
DTaP, Hib, and Hep B 
vaccines administered concomitantly 6 weeks later. The third group received MMR and
varicella vaccines concomitantly followed 
6  weeks  later  by  DTaP,  Hib,  and  Hep  B  vaccines.  Seroconversion  rates  and  antibody
titers were comparable for the 
measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella  components  for  the  first  two  groups.  No
immunologic data were reported for 
the  third  group.  The  Hib  and  Hep  B  seroconversion  rates  for  the  two  groups  that
received those vaccines also were comparable.
Data are absent or limited for the concomitant use of MMRV vaccine with inactivated
polio, pneumococal 
conjugate,  influenza,  and  hepatitis  A  vaccines.  Simultaneous  administration  of  the
majority of widely used live and inactivated 
vaccines has produced seroconversion rates and rates of adverse reactions similar to
those observed when the vaccines 
are administered separately. Therefore, single-antigen and combination MMRV vaccines
may be administered simultaneously 
with other vaccines recommended for children aged 12--15 months and those aged 4--6
years. Simultaneous administration 
is 
particularly important when health-care providers anticipate 
that, because of certain factors (e.g., previously 
missed vaccination opportunities), a child might not return for subsequent vaccination.
Economic Analysis of Vaccination
A  cost-effectiveness  analysis  was  performed  before  initiation  of  the  varicella
vaccination program in the United States 
(138).  The  results  of  the  study  indicated  a  savings  of  $5.40  for  each  dollar  spent  on
routine vaccination of preschool-aged 
children when direct and indirect costs were considered. When only direct medical costs
were considered, the benefit-cost ratio 
was  0.9:1.0.  Benefit-cost  ratios  were  only  slightly  lower  when  lower  estimates  of  the
short- and long-term effectiveness of 
the vaccine were used.
A recent analysis was performed that used current estimates of morbidity and mortality
(20,28,33) and current direct and indirect costs (ACIP, unpublished presentation, 2006).
The model considered that the second dose will reduce varicella 
disease residual after the first dose by 79%. From a societal perspective, both 1-dose
and 2-dose vaccination programs are cost 
saving compared with no program. The vaccine program cost was estimated at $320
million for 1 dose and $538 million for 2 
doses. The savings from varicella disease prevented were estimated at approximately
$1.3 billion for the 1-dose program 
and  approximately  $1.4  billion  for  the  2-dose  program.  Compared  with  the  1-dose
program, the incremental cost for the 
second dose was estimated to be $96,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. If
benefits from preventing group 
A streptococcus infections and HZ among vaccinated persons are added, incremental
costs per QALY saved are $91,000 
and $17,000, respectively. Because of the uncertainty of the modeled predictions of an
increase in HZ among persons with 
a history of varicella and the fact that no consistent trends 
demonstrate an increase in HZ attributable to the 
varicella vaccination program in the United States, HZ among persons with a history of
varicella was not included in the model.
Storage, Handling, and Transportation of Varicella Vaccines
Single-antigen varicella and combination MMRV vaccines have similar but not identical
distribution, handling, and 
storage  requirements  (79,80).  For  potency  to  be  maintained,  the  lyophilized  varicella
vaccines must be stored frozen at an 
average temperature of 5°F (-15°C) or colder. Household freezers manufactured since
the mid-1980s are designed to 
maintain  temperatures  from  -4°F  (-20°C)  to  5°F  (-15°C).  When  tested,  VARIVAX  has
remained stable in frost-free freezers. 
Freezers that reliably maintain an average temperature of <5°F (<-15°C) and that have
a separate sealed freezer door are acceptable 
for storing VARIVAX and ProQuad. Health-care providers may use stand-alone freezers
or the freezer compartment 
of refrigerator-freezer combinations, provided that the freezer compartment has its own
separate, sealed, and insulated 
exterior  door.  Units  with  an  internal  freezer  door  are  not  acceptable.  Temperatures
should be documented at the beginning and end 
of each day. Providers should document the required temperature in a newly purchased
unit for a minimum of 1 week 
before  using  it  to  store  vaccine  and  routinely  thereafter.  When  varicella  vaccines  are
stored in the freezer compartment of a 
combined  refrigerator-freezer,  temperatures  in  both  compartments  should  be
monitored carefully. Setting the thermostat low enough 
for  storage  of  varicella-containing  vaccines  might  inadvertently  expose  refrigerated
vaccines to freezing temperatures. 
Refrigerators with ice compartments that either are not tightly enclosed or are enclosed
with unsealed, uninsulated doors (e.g., 
small, dormitory-style refrigerators) are not acceptable 
for the storage of varicella vaccines.
Diluent should be stored separately either at room temperature or in the refrigerator.
Vaccines should be 
reconstituted according to the directions in the package insert and only with the diluent
supplied with the vaccine, which does not 
contain  preservative  or  other  antiviral  substances  that  could  inactivate  the  vaccine
virus. Once reconstituted, vaccine should be 
used immediately to minimize loss of potency. Vaccine should be discarded if not used
within 30 minutes after reconstitution.
Handling and Transportation of Varicella Vaccines Within Off-Site Clinics
When an immunization session is being held at a site distant from the freezer in which
the vaccine is stored, the number 
of  vaccine  vials  needed  for  the  immunization  session  should  be  packed  in  either  a
vaccine shipping container (as received 
from the manufacturer) or in an insulated cooler, with an 
adequate quantity of dry ice (i.e., a minimum of 6 lbs per box) to 
preserve  potency.  When  placed  in  a  suitable  container,  dry  ice  will  maintain  a
temperature of 
<5°F (<-15°C). Dry ice should remain 
in 
the container upon arrival at the clinic site. If no dry ice remains when the container is
opened at the receiving site, 
the  manufacturer  (Merck  and  Company,  Inc.)  should  be  contacted  for  guidance
(telephone: 1-800-982-7482). If dry ice 
is  available  at  the  receiving  site,  it  may  be  used  to  store  vaccine.  Thermometers  or
temperature indicators cannot be used in 
a container with dry ice. Diluent should not be transported on dry ice.
If dry ice is not available, only single-antigen varicella vaccine may be transported, with
frozen packs to keep 
the  temperatures  between  36°F--46°F  (2°C--8°C).  Transport  temperatures  should  be
monitored, and a temperature indicator 
or thermometer should be placed in the container and checked on arrival. The container
should be kept closed as much 
as  possible  during  the  immunization  session;  temperatures  should  be  checked  and
recorded hourly. If the temperature 
remains  between  36°F--46°F  (2°C--8°C),  the  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  may  be
used for up to 72 hours after its removal from 
the  freezer.  The  date  and  time  should  be  marked  on  the  vaccine  vial.  Single-antigen
varicella vaccine stored at 
refrigerated temperatures for any period of time may not be refrozen for future use.
Transportation  and  storage  of  combination  MMRV  vaccine  at  temperatures  between
36°F--46°F (2°C--8°C) is not 
permissible  for  any  length  of  time.  In  contrast  to  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine,
combination MMRV vaccine must be maintained 
at temperatures of <5°F 
(<-15°C) until the time of reconstitution and administration. This difference in vaccine 
storage  temperatures  must  be  considered  when  planning  off-site  clinics.  For  this
reason, transportation of MMRV vaccine to 
off-site  clinics  is  not  advised.  If  any  concerns  arise  regarding  the  storage  of
single-antigen varicella or combination MMRV vaccines, 
the manufacturer should be contacted for guidance.
Minimizing Wastage of Vaccine 
Vaccine  wastage  can  be  minimized  by  accurately  determining  the  number  of  doses
needed for a given patient population. 
To ensure maximal vaccine potency, smaller shipments of vaccine should be ordered
more frequently (preferably at least 
once  every  3  months).  Single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  should  not  be  distributed  to
providers who do not have the capacity to 
store it properly in a freezer until it is used. Transportation of varicella vaccine should
be kept to a minimum to prevent loss 
of potency. Off-site clinic sites should receive only such amounts of vaccine as they can
use within a short time (72 hours 
if storing single-antigen varicella vaccine at refrigerated temperatures).
Adverse Events After Vaccination
Because  adverse  events  after  vaccination  might  continue  to  be  caused  by  wild-type
VZV even as varicella disease 
declines, health-care providers should obtain event-appropriate clinical specimens (e.g.,
cerebrospinal fluid for encephalitis,

The  National  Vaccine  Injury  Act  of  1986  requires  physicians  and  other  health-care
providers who administer vaccines 
to  maintain  permanent  immunization  records  and  to  report  occurrences  of  adverse
events for selected vaccines, 
including varicella vaccines. Serious adverse events (i.e., all events 
requiring medical attention) suspected to have been caused by 
varicella vaccines should be reported to the Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Forms and instructions are available

Prelicensure
Single-Antigen Varicella Vaccine 
Single-antigen varicella vaccine was well-tolerated when 
administered to >11,000 healthy children, adolescents, and 
adults during prelicensure clinical trials. In a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study among 914 susceptible healthy children aged 
12 months--14 years, the only statistically significant (p<0.05) adverse events reported
that were more common among 
vaccine  recipients  than  among  placebo  recipients  were  pain  and  redness  at  the
injection site 
(103). This study also described the presence of 
unspecific rash among 2% of placebo and 4% of vaccine 
recipients occurring within 43 days of vaccination. 
Of 
the  28  reported  rashes,  10  (36%)  were  examined  by  a  physician;  among  those  that
were examined, four of the 
seven  noninjection  site  rashes  in  vaccine  recipients  were  judged  to  be  varicella-like,
compared with none of the rashes in the 
placebo recipients.
In a study comparing the safety of 1 dose of single-antigen varicella vaccine with that of
2 doses administered 3 
months apart, no serious adverse events related to vaccination were reported among
approximately 2,000 healthy subjects aged 
12  months--12  years  who  were  followed  for  42  days  after  each  injection.  The  2-dose
vaccine regimen was generally 
well-tolerated,  and  its  safety  profile  was  comparable  to  that  of  the  1-dose  regimen.
Incidence of injection site complaints 
observed <3 days after vaccination was slightly higher after dose 2 (25.4%) than after
dose 1 (21.7%). Incidence of systemic clinical 
complaints was lower after dose 2; fever incidence from days 7--21 was 7% after dose 1
and 4% after dose 2 (p = 0.009), and 
varicelliform rash incidence after dose 1 was 3%, compared with 1% after dose 2 (p =
0.008), with peak occurrence 8--21 days 
after vaccination (139).
In uncontrolled trials of persons aged 
>13 years , approximately 1,600 vaccine recipients who received 1 dose of 
single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  and  955  who  received  2  doses  of  vaccine  were
monitored for 42 days for adverse events 
(79).  After  the  first  and  second  doses,  24.4%  and  32.5%  of  vaccine  recipients,
respectively, had complaints regarding the injection 
site. Varicella-like rash at the injection site occurred in 3% of vaccine recipients after
the first injection and in 1% after the 
second.  A  nonlocalized  rash  occurred  in  5.5%  of  vaccine  recipients  after  the  first
injection and in 0.9% of vaccine recipients after 
the second, at a peak of 7--21 and 0--23 days postvaccination, respectively.
Combination MMRV Vaccine
In clinical trials, combination MMRV vaccine was administered to 4,497 children aged
12--23 months 
without concomitant administration with other vaccines 
(80). The safety profile of the first dose was compared with the safety 
of MMRII vaccine and VARIVAX administered concomitantly at separate injection sites.
The follow-up period was 42 
days  postvaccination.  Systemic  vaccine-related  adverse  events  were  reported  at  a
statistically significantly greater rate in persons 
who  received  MMRV  vaccine  than  in  persons  who  received  the  two  vaccines
administered concomitantly at separate 
injection sites: fever (>102°F 
[>38.9°C]  oral  equivalent),  (21.5%  and  14.9%,  respectively),  and  measles-like  rash
(3.0% and 
2.1%, respectively). Both fever and measles-like rash usually occurred within 5--12 days
after the vaccination, were of short 
duration, and resolved with no long-term sequelae. Pain, tenderness, and soreness at
the injection site were reported at a 
statistically  significantly  lower  rate  in  persons  who  received  the  combination  MMRV
vaccine (22.0%) than in those who received 
MMRII  and  VARIVAX  vaccines  (26.7%).  Rash  at  the  injection  site  was  more  frequent
among recipients of 
1-dose MMRV vaccine (2.3%) than among recipients of the two vaccines administered
separately as first doses (1.5%). A study that also 
compared  use  of  MMRV  with  MMRII  and  VARIVAX  administered  as  a  first  dose
demonstrated similar results 
(90). During days 5--12, children in the group that received MMRV had higher rates of
elevated temperatures than those in the group that 
received MMRII and VARIVAX (27.7% and 18.7%, respectively; p = 0.034).
To demonstrate that MMRV vaccine could be administered as a second dose, a study
was conducted involving 799 
children  aged  4--6  years  who  had  received  primary  doses  of  MMRII  and  VARIVAX
vaccines, either concomitantly or not, at age 
>12 months and >1 month before study enrollment 
(91). These children were vaccinated randomly (with MMRV and 
placebo, MMR and placebo, or MMRII and VARIVAX) and then monitored for safety. No
serious vaccine-related adverse 
experiences  were  reported.  Overall,  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  one  or  more
adverse event were comparable among groups 
receiving  MMRV,  MMRII,  and  MMRII  and  VARIVAX.  The  group  receiving  MMRV  vaccine
had a statistically significantly 
greater proportion of subjects with erythema (p = 0.01) and swelling (p = 0.008) at the
injection site 1--5 days after 
vaccination.  Another  study  examined  the  safety  of  2  doses  of  MMRV  administered  3
months apart to 480 children aged 12--23 
months (90). The rate of adverse events typically was lower after the second dose of
MMRV than after the first dose. The incidence 
of varicella-like rashes was lower after a second dose of MMRV than after concomitant
administration of MMRII and 
VARIVAX vaccines (0.0% and 1.9%, respectively; p = 0.01).
Postlicensure
During  March  1,  1995--December  31,  2005,  a  total  of  47.7  million  doses  of  varicella
vaccine were distributed in the 
United  States,  and  25,306  adverse  events  that  occurred  after  varicella  vaccine
administration were reported to VAERS, 1,276 (5%) 
of which were classified as serious. The overall adverse event reporting rate was 52.7
cases per 100,000 doses distributed. The 
rate 
of reporting of serious adverse events was 2.6 per 100,000 doses distributed. Half of all
adverse events reported 
occurred among children aged 12--23 months (VAERS, 
unpublished data, 2006).
Not all adverse events that occur after vaccination are 
reported, and many reports describe events that might have 
been  caused  by  confounding  or  unrelated  factors  (e.g.,  medications  and  other
diseases). Because varicella disease continues to 
occur,  wild-type  virus  might  account  for  certain  reported  events.  For  serious  adverse
events for which background incidence data 
are  known,  VAERS  reporting  rates  are  lower  than  expected  after  natural  varicella  or
than background rates of disease in 
the  community.  Inherent  limitations  of  passive  safety  surveillance  impede  comparing
adverse event rates after vaccination 
reported to VAERS with those from complications after natural disease. Nevertheless,
the magnitude of these differences suggests 
that serious adverse events occur at a substantially 
lower rate after vaccination than after natural disease. This assumption 
is  corroborated  by  the  substantial  decline  in  the  number  of  severe  complications,
hospitalizations, and deaths related to 
varicella  that  have  been  reported  since  implementation  of  the  varicella  vaccination
program 
(22,23,28).
Similar  to  the  prelicensure  experience,  postlicensure  safety  surveillance  data  after
administration of single-antigen 
varicella vaccine indicated that rash, fever, and injection-site reactions were the most
frequently reported adverse events 
(140,141). Using these reports from passive surveillance of adverse events during the
first 4 years of the vaccination program, when 
wild-type  VZV  was  still  circulating  widely,  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  analysis
confirmed that the majority of rash 
events  occurring  within  42  days  of  vaccination  were  caused  primarily  by  wild-type
varicella-zoster virus. Rashes from the 
wild-type  virus  occurred  a  median  of  8  days  after  vaccination  (range:  1--24  days),
whereas rashes from the vaccine strain occurred 
a median of 21 days after vaccination (range: 5--42 days) 
(140).
As  part  of  postmarketing  evaluation  of  the  short-term  safety  of  VARIVAX,  89,753
vaccinated adults and children 
were identified from automated clinical databases of hospitals, emergency room visits,
and clinic visits during April 
1995--December 1996 (56). Out of all potential adverse events identified, no consistent
time association or clustering of any 
events  was  noted  during  the  exposure  follow-up  period.  No  cases  of  ataxia  or
encephalitis were identified after receipt of 
varicella  vaccine  in  this  group  of  vaccine  recipients.  In  the  prevaccine  era,  among
children aged <15 years, acute cerebellar ataxia 
was  estimated  to  occur  at  a  rate  of  one  in  4,000  varicella  cases,  and  varicella
encephalitis without ataxia was estimated to 
occur at one in 33,000 varicella cases (142).
Severe complications that are laboratory-confirmed to be caused by vaccine virus strain
are rare and include 
pneumonia (140), hepatitis (143), severe disseminated varicella infection 
(140,141,144,145), and secondary transmission from 
five  vaccine  recipients  (140,146--148).  Except  for  the  secondary  transmission  cases,
these cases all occurred 
in  immunocompromised  patients  or  in  persons  who  had  other  serious  medical
conditions that were undiagnosed at the time 
of vaccination.
Although other serious adverse events have been reported, vaccine strain involvement
was not 
laboratory-confirmed. Thrombocytopenia 
(140,141,149) and acute cerebellar ataxia 
(140,141,150) have been described as potentially 
associated  with  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine.  Two  children  had  acute  hemiparesis
diagnosed after varicella vaccination (one at 5 
days and the other at 3 weeks) (151). In both cases, unilateral 
infarction of the basal ganglia and internal capsule was noted; 
this distribution is consistent with varicella angiopathy. Urticaria after varicella vaccine
has been associated with gelatin 
allergy (152). Recurrent papular urticaria has been reported to be potentially associated
with varicella vaccination 
(153). However, available data regarding the potential adverse events after 
varicella vaccination are insufficient to determine a 
causal association. The quality of reported information varies widely, and simultaneous
administration with other 
vaccines (especially MMR) might confound attribution.
Herpes Zoster. Similar to wild-type VZV, vaccine virus can establish latent infection and
subsequently reactivate, causing 
HZ  disease  in  vaccine  recipients.  Before  vaccine  licensure,  studies  in  children  with
leukemia had demonstrated a much lower rate 
of  HZ  in  vaccinated  children  compared  with  those  (age  and  protocol  matched)  with
previous varicella 
(54). Cases of HZ in healthy vaccine recipients have been confirmed to be caused by
both vaccine virus and wild-type virus, suggesting that certain HZ cases 
in vaccine recipients might result from antecedent natural 
varicella infection that might not have been detected by the 
patient or from infection after vaccination 
(140). A single case has been reported of a child who received a diagnosis of 
neuroblastoma  and  had  severe  chronic  zoster  attributed  to  vaccine  virus  strain  that
with time became drug resistant 
(145). A large postlicensure safety study performed through surveys conducted every 6
months and validated by medical chart review in the first 9 years of a 
15-year follow-up study of >7,000 enrolled children vaccinated with 
single-antigen varicella vaccine at age 12--24 months estimated 
HZ disease incidence to be 22 per 100,000 person-years (CI = 13--37) as reported by
parents (Steven Black, MD, 
Northern 
California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, unpublished presentation, 2005).
The incidence of HZ was 30 per 
100,000 person-years among healthy children aged 5--9 years 
(154) and 46 per 100,000 person-years for those aged 
<14 years (64). However, these rates are drawn from different populations and based
on different methodologies. In addition, a proportion 
of  children  in  these  age  groups  would  not  have  experienced  varicella  disease;  those
rates are likely to underestimate rates in a 
cohort of children all infected with wild-type VZV, making direct comparison 
difficult with a vaccinated cohort.
Transmission of Vaccine Virus
Results from prelicensure vaccine trials of the 
single-antigen varicella vaccine suggest that transmission of varicella 
vaccine  virus  from  healthy  persons  to  susceptible  contacts  is  rare.  This  risk  was
assessed in siblings of healthy vaccinated children 
who  themselves  received  placebo  (103).  Six  (1%)  of  439  placebo  recipients
seroconverted without rash; the vaccinated siblings 
of these six children also did not develop rash. Serologic data suggested that three of
these six seroconverters received 
vaccine  mistakenly  in  lieu  of  their  siblings.  In  a  smaller  study,  immunocompromised
siblings of healthy children 
receiving  varicella  vaccine  were  evaluated  clinically  and  by  testing  for  humoral  or
cell-mediated immune responses 
(155).  No  evidence  was  demonstrated  of  vaccine  virus  transmission  to  any  of  30
immunocompromised 
siblings from 37 healthy children receiving varicella vaccine.
Accumulated  data  from  postlicensure  surveillance  activities  suggest  that  the  risk  for
transmission of varicella vaccine 
virus  from  healthy  persons  to  susceptible  contacts  is  low.  With  >55  million  doses  of
VARIVAX distributed since 
licensure,  transmission  from  immunocompetent  persons  after  vaccination  has  been
documented by PCR analysis from only five 
persons, resulting in six secondary infections, all of them mild 
(140,146--148). Three episodes involved transmission from 
healthy children aged 1 year to healthy household contacts, including a sibling aged 4
months, a father, and a pregnant mother. In 
the latter episode, the mother chose to terminate the pregnancy, but fetal tissue tested
subsequently by PCR was negative 
for  varicella  vaccine  virus  (147).  The  children  in  these  episodes  had  2,  12,  and  30
lesions, respectively. A fourth episode 
involved transmission from an immunocompetent adolescent who was a resident in an
institution for chronically disabled children. 
The adolescent had >500 lesions after vaccination, and vaccine virus was transmitted
to another immunocompetent resident of 
the institution and to a health-care worker, both of whom had histories of varicella 
(146). The fifth episode represented a 
tertiary spread from a healthy sibling contact of a vaccinee with leukemia 
(148). Rashes for both healthy siblings were mild (i.e., 
40  and  11  lesions,  respectively),  and  vaccine  virus  was  isolated  from  all  three
case-patients. The third sibling had rash 18 
days after the onset of the secondary case-patient and 33 days after rash onset in the
vaccinated leukemic child. In addition to 
these five episodes, one child has been reported to have transmitted vaccine virus from
HZ that occurred 5 months after 
varicella  vaccination;  2  weeks  later,  a  mild  varicella-like  rash  from  which  vaccine
varicella virus was isolated occurred in the 
child's vaccinated brother (156).
Although  varicella  vaccine  is  not  recommended  for  children  with  cellular  immune
deficiencies, the experience 
from  prelicensure  vaccine  trials  involving  children  with  leukemia  is  instructive.  Data
from a study of varicella vaccination 
in children with leukemia indicated that varicella virus vaccine transmission occurred in
15 (17%) of 88 healthy, 
susceptible siblings of leukemic vaccine recipients; the rash was mild in 11 (73%) of the
15 infected siblings 
(148). The risk for transmission was correlated with the number of skin lesions in the
immunocompromised vaccine recipients.
These  data  suggest  that  healthy,  vaccinated  persons  have  a  minimal  risk  for
transmitting vaccine virus to their 
contacts, particularly in the absence of vaccine rash in the vaccine 
recipient. Vaccine recipients who have a vaccine-related 
rash, particularly HCP and household contacts of immunocompromised persons, should
avoid contact with persons 
without  evidence  of  immunity  who  are  at  high  risk  for  severe  complications  (see
Health-Care Personnel)
Summary of Rationale for Varicella Vaccination
Varicella vaccine is an effective prevention tool for decreasing the burden attributable
to varicella disease and 
its complications in the United States. In the prevaccine era, varicella was a childhood
disease with >90% of the 4 million 
cases, two thirds of approximately 11,000 hospitalizations, and 
approximately half of 100--150 annual deaths occurring 
among persons aged <20 years. Single-antigen varicella vaccine is 
licensed for use among healthy persons aged 
>12 months, and the combination MMRV vaccine is licensed for use in healthy children
aged 12 months--12 years. Prelicensure and 
postlicensure 
studies  have  demonstrated  that  1  dose  of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  is
approximately 85% effective in preventing 
varicella. Breakthrough varicella disease that occurs 
after vaccination frequently is mild and modified. 
Varicella  vaccine  is  >95%  effective  in  preventing  severe  varicella  disease.  Since
implementation of the varicella vaccination program in 1995, varicella 
incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths have declined substantially. MMRV was licensed
on the basis of immunological noninferiority 
to  its  vaccine  antigenic  components.  Initial  varicella  vaccine  policy  recommendations
were for 1 dose of varicella vaccine 
for children aged 12 months--12 years and 2 doses, 4--8 weeks apart, for persons aged 
>13 years. In June 2006, ACIP approved a routine 2-dose recommendation for children.
The first dose should be administered at age 12--15 months and the second 
dose at age 4--6 years.
The rationale for the second dose of varicella vaccine for children is to further decrease
varicella disease and its 
complications in the United States. Despite the successes of the 
1-dose vaccination program in children, vaccine effectiveness of 85% has 
not  been  sufficient  to  prevent  varicella  outbreaks,  which,  although  less  than  in  the
prevaccine era, have continued to occur 
in highly vaccinated school populations. Breakthrough varicella is contagious. Studies of
the immune response after 1 and 
2  doses  of  varicella  vaccine  demonstrate  a  greater-than-tenfold  boost  in  GMTs  when
measured 6 weeks after the second 
varicella  vaccine  dose.  A  higher  proportion  (>99%)  of  children  achieve  an  antibody
response of 
>5  gpELISA  units  after  the  second  dose  compared  with  76%--85%  of  children  after  a
single dose of varicella vaccine. The second dose of varicella vaccine is 
expected  to  provide  improved  protection  to  the  15%--20%  of  children  who  do  not
respond adequately to the first dose. Data from 
a randomized clinical trial conducted postlicensure indicated that vaccine efficacy after 
2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine in children (98.3%; CI = 97.3%--99.0%) was
significantly higher than that after a single dose (94.4%; CI 
=92.9%--95.7%). The risk for breakthrough disease was 3.3-fold lower among children
who 
received 2 doses than it was among children who received 
1 dose. How this increase in vaccine efficacy (typically higher than observed under field
conditions) will translate 
into vaccine effectiveness under conditions of community use will be an important area
of study.
The recommended ages for routine first (at age 12--15 months) and second (at age 4--6
years) doses of varicella vaccine 
are harmonized with the recommendations for MMR vaccine use and intended to limit
the period when children have 
no varicella antibody. The recommended age for the 
second dose is supported by the current epidemiology of 
varicella,  with  low  incidence  and  few  outbreaks  among  preschool-aged  children  and
higher incidence and more outbreaks among 
elementary-school--aged children. However, the second dose may be administered at
an earlier age, provided that the interval between 
the first and second doses is 3 months. The recommendation for the minimum interval
between doses is made on the basis of 
the design of the studies evaluating 2 doses among children aged 12 months--12 years.
MMRV vaccine may be used to 
vaccinate  children  against  measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella  simultaneously.
Because the risk for transmission can be high 
among students in schools, colleges, and other postsecondary educational institutions,
students without evidence of immunity 
should receive 2 doses of varicella vaccine. All children and adolescents who received 
1 dose of varicella vaccine previously should receive a second dose.
Varicella  disease  is  more  severe  and  its  complications  more  frequent  among
adolescents and adults. The recommendation 
for vaccination of all adolescents and adults without 
evidence of immunity will provide protection in these age groups. 
Because  varicella  might  be  more  severe  in  immunocompromised  persons  who  might
not be eligible for vaccination, and because of 
the risk of VZV transmission in health-care settings, HCP must be vaccinated. Varicella 
disease during the first two trimesters of pregnancy might 
infect  the  fetus  and  result  in  congenital  varicella  syndrome.  Therefore,  routine
antenatal screening 
for  evidence  of  immunity  and  postpartum  vaccination  for  those  without  evidence  of
immunity now is recommended.
Recommendations for the Use of Varicella Vaccines
Two 0.5-mL doses of varicella vaccine administered subcutaneously are recommended
for children aged 
>12 months, adolescents, and adults without evidence of immunity. For children aged
12 months--12 years, the recommended 
minimum interval between the two doses is 3 months. However, if the second dose was
administered 
>28 days after the first dose, the second dose is considered valid and need not be 
repeated. For persons aged >13 years, the recommended minimum 
interval is 4 weeks. Single-antigen varicella vaccine is approved for use among healthy
persons aged 
>12 months. Combination MMRV vaccine is approved for use among healthy children
aged 12 months--12 years. MMRV vaccine is indicated for 
simultaneous  vaccination  against  measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella.  Whenever
any components of the combination vaccine 
are 
indicated and the other components are not 
contraindicated, use of licensed combination vaccines, such as MMRV vaccine, 
is preferred over separate injection of equivalent component vaccines 
(157).
Routine Vaccination
Persons Aged 12 Months--12 Years
Preschool-Aged Children
All  healthy  children  should  receive  their  first  dose  of  varicella-containing  vaccine
routinely at age 12--15 months.
School-Aged Children
A second dose of varicella vaccine is recommended routinely for all children aged 4--6
years (i.e., before 
entering  prekindergarten,  kindergarten,  or  first  grade).  However,  it  may  be
administered at an earlier age provided that the 
interval between the first and second dose is >3 months.
Because  of  the  risk  for  transmission  of  VZV  in  schools,  all  children  entering  school
should have received 2 doses of 
varicella-containing  vaccine  or  have  other  evidence  of  immunity  to  varicella  (see
Evidence of Immunity).
Persons Aged >13 Years
Persons  aged  >13  years  without  evidence  of  varicella  immunity  should  receive  two
0.5-mL doses of single-antigen 
varicella  vaccine  administered  subcutaneously,  4--8  weeks  apart.  If  >8  weeks  elapse
after the first dose, the second dose may 
be administered without restarting the schedule. Only single-antigen varicella vaccine
may be used for vaccination of persons 
in this age group. MMRV is not licensed for use among persons aged 
>13 years.
School-Aged  Children,  College  Students,  and  Students  in  Other  Postsecondary
Educational Institutions
All students should be assessed for varicella immunity, and those without evidence of
immunity should routinely receive 
2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine 4--8 weeks apart. The risk for transmission of
varicella among school-aged 
children, college students, and students in other postsecondary educational institutions
can be high because of high contact rates.
Other Adults
All healthy adults should be assessed for varicella immunity, and those who do not have
evidence of immunity 
should receive 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine 4--8 weeks apart. Adults who
might be at increased risk for exposure 
or  transmission  and  who  do  not  have  evidence  of  immunity  should  receive  special
consideration for vaccination, 
including  1)  HCP,  2)  household  contacts  of  immunocompromised  persons,  3)  persons
who live or work in environments in 
which transmission of VZV is likely (e.g., teachers, day-care employees, residents and
staff in institutional settings), 4) persons 
who live or work in environments in which transmission has been reported (e.g., college
students, inmates and staff members 
of  correctional  institutions,  and  military  personnel),  5)  nonpregnant  women  of
childbearing age, 6) adolescents and adults 
living in households with children, and 7) international travelers.
Second Dose Catch-Up Vaccination
To improve individual protection against varicella and to have a more rapid impact on
school outbreaks, second dose 
catch-up  varicella  vaccination  is  recommended  for  children,  adolescents,  and  adults
who previously 
received 1 dose. The recommended minimum interval between the first dose and the
catch-up second dose is 3 months for children aged 
<12 years and 4 weeks for persons aged 
>13  years.  However,  the  catch-up  second  dose  may  be  administered  at  any  interval
longer 
than the minimum recommended interval. Catch-up vaccination may be implemented
during routine health-care provider 
visits and through school- and college-entry requirements.
As  part  of  comprehensive  health  services  for  all  adolescents,  ACIP,  AAP,  and  AAFP
recommend a health maintenance visit 
at age 11--12 years. This visit also should serve as an immunization visit to evaluate
vaccination status and administer 
necessary  vaccinations  (158).  Physicians  should  use  this  and  other  routine  visits  to
ensure that all children without evidence of 
varicella immunity have received 2 doses of varicella vaccine.
Requirements for Entry to Child Care, School, College, and Other 
Postsecondary Educational Institutions
Child care and school entry requirements for varicella 
immunity have been recommended previously 
(2). In 2005, ACIP recommended expanding the requirements to cover students in all
grade levels. Official health agencies should take 
necessary steps, including developing and enforcing school immunization requirements,
to ensure that students at all grade 
levels  (including  college)  and  children  in  child  care  centers  are  protected  against
varicella and other vaccine-preventable 
diseases (157).
Prenatal Assessment and Postpartum Vaccination
Prenatal assessment of women for evidence of varicella 
immunity is recommended. Birth before 1980 is not 
considered  evidence  of  immunity  for  pregnant  women  because  of  potential  severe
consequences of varicella infection during 
pregnancy,  including  infection  of  the  fetus.  Upon  completion  or  termination  of  their
pregnancies, women who do not have evidence 
of varicella immunity should receive the first dose of vaccine before discharge from the
health-care 
facility. The second dose should be administered 4--8 weeks later, which 
coincides with the postpartum visit (6--8 weeks after delivery). For 
women who gave birth, the second dose should be administered 
at the postpartum visit. Women should be counseled to 
avoid conception for 1 month after each dose of varicella vaccine. Health-care settings
in which completion or termination 
of  pregnancy  occurs  should  use  standing  orders  to  ensure  the  administration  of
varicella vaccine to women 
without evidence of immunity.
Special Considerations for Vaccination
Vaccination of HIV-Infected Persons
HIV-infected children with CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage >15% should be considered
for vaccination with the 
single-antigen  varicella  vaccine.  Varicella  vaccine  was  recommended  previously  for
HIV-infected children in CDC clinical 
and  immunologic  categories  N1  and  A1  with  age-specific  CD4+  T-lymphocyte
percentage 
>25% (2). Limited data from a 
clinical  trial  in  which  2  doses  of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  were  administered  3
months apart to 37 HIV-infected children 
(CDC  clinical  categories  N,  A,  or  B  and  immunologic  category  2  [CD4+  T-lymphocyte
percentage 
>15%--24%])  aged  1--8  years  indicated  that  the  vaccine  was  well-tolerated  and  that
>80% of subjects had detectable VZV specific 
immune  response  (either  antibody  or  cell  immune  response  or  both)  at  1  year  after
immunization 
(159). These children were no less likely to have 
an  antibody  response  to  the  varicella  vaccine  than  were  subjects  who  were  less
affected immunologically by HIV 
infection.  Because  children  infected  with  HIV  are  at  increased  risk  for  morbidity  from
varicella and HZ (i.e., shingles) compared 
with  healthy  children,  ACIP  recommends  that,  after  weighing  potential  risks  and
benefits, single-antigen varicella vaccine should 
be considered for HIV-infected children with CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentages 
>15%. Eligible children should receive 2 doses 
of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  3  months  apart.  Because  persons  with  impaired
cellular immunity are potentially at greater 
risk for complications after vaccination with a live vaccine, these vaccine 
recipients should be encouraged to return for evaluation 
if they experience a postvaccination varicella-like rash. Data are not available regarding
safety, immunogenicity, or efficacy 
of MMRV vaccine in HIV-infected children, MMRV vaccine should not be administered as
a substitute for the 
single-antigen varicella vaccine when vaccinating these children. The titer of Oka/Merck
VZV is higher in combination 
MMRV  vaccine  than  in  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine.  Recommendations  for
vaccination of HIV-infected children with 
measles, mumps, or rubella vaccines have been published previously 
(160).
Data  on  use  of  varicella  vaccine  in  HIV-infected  adolescents  and  adults  are  lacking.
However, on the basis of expert 
opinion,  the  safety  of  varicella  vaccine  in  HIV-infected  persons  aged  >8  years  with
comparable levels of immune function 
(CD4+T-lymphocyte count >200 
cells/µL) is likely to be similar to that of children aged <8 years. Immunogenicity might
be lower 
in older HIV-infected children, adolescents, and adults compared to children aged 1--8
years. However, weighing the risk 
for severe disease from wild VZV and potential benefit of vaccination, vaccination may
be considered (2 doses, administered 
3 
months apart) for HIV-infected persons with CD4+T-lymphocytes count 
>200 cells/µL in these age groups. If vaccination 
of HIV-infected persons results in clinical disease, the use of acyclovir might modify the
severity of disease.
Situations in Which Some Degree of Immunodeficiency Might be Present
Persons  with  impaired  humoral  immunity  may  be  vaccinated.  No  data  have  been
published concerning whether 
persons without evidence of immunity receiving only inhaled, nasal, or topical doses of
steroids can be vaccinated safely. 
However,  clinical  experience  suggests  that  vaccination  is  well-tolerated  among  these
persons. Persons without evidence of immunity 
who are receiving systemic steroids for certain conditions (e.g., asthma) and who are
not otherwise immunocompromised may 
be vaccinated if they are receiving <2 mg/kg of body weight or a total of <20 mg/day
of prednisone or its equivalent. 
Certain experts suggest withholding steroids for 2--3 weeks after vaccination if it can be
done safely 
(1).  Data  from  a  Japanese  study  using  the  Oka/Biken  varicella  vaccine  (which  is  not
available in the United States but whose immunogenicity and efficacy 
are similar to those of the varicella vaccine used in the United States) indicated that
children taking steroids for nephrosis 
were  vaccinated  safely  when  the  steroids  were  suspended  for  1--2  weeks  before
vaccination, although no 
serious  reactions  occurred  among  children  vaccinated  when  steroid  therapy  was  not
suspended 
(161). Persons who are receiving high doses of 
systemic steroids (i.e., >2 mg/kg prednisone) for 
>2 weeks may be vaccinated once steroid therapy has been discontinued for 
>1  month,  in  accordance  with  the  general  recommendations  for  the  use  of  live-virus
vaccines 
(157). 
Vaccination of leukemic children who are in remission and who do not have evidence of
immunity to varicella should 
be undertaken only with expert guidance and with the availability of antiviral therapy
should complications ensue. Patients 
with  leukemia,  lymphoma,  or  other  malignancies  whose  disease  is  in  remission  and
whose chemotherapy has been terminated for 
at least 3 months can receive live-virus vaccines 
(157). When immunizing persons in whom some degree of 
immunodeficiency  might  be  present,  only  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  should  be
used.
Vaccination of Household Contacts of Immunocompromised Persons
Immunocompromised  persons  are  at  high  risk  for  serious  varicella  infections.  Severe
disease occurs in approximately 30% 
of such persons with primary infection. Because varicella vaccine now is recommended
for all healthy children and 
adults  without  evidence  of  immunity,  household  contacts  of  immunocompromised
persons should be vaccinated routinely. 
Although  the  risk  for  exposure  to  wild  VZV  for  immunocompromised  persons  now  is
lower than it was previously, vaccine should 
be  offered  to  child  and  adult  household  contacts  without  evidence  of  immunity  of
immunocompromised persons. Vaccination 
of  household  contacts  provides  protection  for  immunocompromised  persons  by
decreasing the likelihood that wild-type 
VZV  will  be  introduced  into  the  household.  Vaccination  of  household  contacts  of
immunocompromised persons 
theoretically  might  pose  a  minimal  risk  for  transmission  of  vaccine  virus  to
immunocompromised persons, although in one study, 
no evidence of transmission of vaccine virus was demonstrated after vaccination of 37
healthy siblings of 30 children 
with  malignancy  (155).  No  cases  have  been  documented  of  transmission  of  vaccine
virus to immunocompromised persons in 
the  postlicensure  period  in  the  United  States,  with  >55  million  doses  of  vaccine
distributed. Other data indicate that 
disease  caused  by  vaccine  virus  in  immunocompromised  persons  is  milder  than
wild-type disease and can be treated with 
acyclovir  (148,159).  The  benefits  of  vaccinating  susceptible  household  contacts  of
immunocompromised persons outweigh 
the
 extremely
 low
 potential
 risk
 for
 transmission
 of
 vaccine
 virus
 to
immunocompromised contacts. Vaccine recipients in 
whom  vaccine-related  rash  occurs,  particularly  HCP  and  household  contacts  of
immunocompromised persons, should avoid 
contact  with  susceptible  persons  who  are  at  high  risk  for  severe  complications.  If  a
susceptible, immunocompromised person 
is  inadvertently  exposed  to  a  person  who  has  a  vaccine-related  rash,  postexposure
prophylaxis with VZIG is not 
needed because disease associated with this type of virus is expected to be mild.
Nursing Mothers
Postpartum vaccination of women without evidence of immunity need not be delayed
because of breastfeeding. 
Women  who  have  received  varicella  vaccination  postpartum  may  continue  to
breastfeed. The majority of live vaccines are 
not associated with virus secretion in breast milk 
(157). A study involving 12 women who received single-antigen varicella 
vaccine while breastfeeding indicated no evidence of VZV DNA either in 217 breast milk
samples collected or in infants tested 
after both vaccine doses (162). No infants seroconverted. Another study did not detect
varicella gene sequences in 
the 
postvaccination breast milk samples (163). Therefore, single-antigen varicella vaccine
should be administered to 
nursing  mothers  without  evidence  of  immunity.  Combination  MMRV  vaccine  is  not
licensed for use among persons aged 
>13 years.
Health-Care Personnel
Nosocomial transmission of VZV is well-recognized 
(131,164--173), and guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial 
VZV infection and for infection control in HCP have been published 
(174,175). Sources of nosocomial exposure have 
included patients, hospital staff, and visitors (e.g., the children of hospital employees)
who are infected with varicella or HZ. 
In hospitals, airborne transmission of VZV has been demonstrated when varicella has
occurred in susceptible persons who had 
no direct contact with the index case-patient 
(176--180).
To  prevent  disease  and  nosocomial  spread  of  VZV,  health-care  institutions  should
ensure that all HCP have evidence 
of immunity to varicella. Birth before 1980 is not considered evidence of immunity for
HCP because of the possibility 
of  nosocomial  transmission  to  high-risk  patients.  In  health-care  institutions,  serologic
screening before vaccination of 
personnel  who  have  a  negative  or  uncertain  history  of  varicella  and  who  are
unvaccinated is likely to be cost effective. Institutions 
may elect to test all HCP regardless of disease history because a small proportion of
persons with a positive history of 
disease might be susceptible.
Routine testing for varicella immunity after 2 doses of vaccine is not recommended for
the management of vaccinated 
HCP.  Available  commercial  assays  are  not  sensitive  enough  to  detect  antibody  after
vaccination in all instances. Sensitive tests 
have indicated that 99% of adults develop antibodies after the second dose. However,
seroconversion does not always result in 
full  protection  against  disease,  and  no  data  regarding  correlates  of  protection  are
available for adults.
HCP  who  have  received  2  doses  of  vaccine  and  who  are  exposed  to  VZV  should  be
monitored daily during days 10--21 
after exposure through the employee health program or by an infection control nurse to
determine clinical status (i.e., daily 
screen for fever, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms). Persons with varicella might be
infectious up to 2 days before rash onset. 
In addition, HCP should be instructed to report fever, headache, or other constitutional
symptoms and any atypical skin 
lesions  immediately.  HCP  should  be  placed  on  sick  leave  immediately  if  symptoms
occur. Health-care institutions should 
establish  protocols  and  recommendations  for  screening  and  vaccinating  HCP  and  for
management of HCP after exposures in the 
work place.
HCP who have received 1 dose of vaccine and who are 
exposed to VZV should receive the second dose with 
single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  within  3--5  days  after  exposure  to  rash  (provided  4
weeks have elapsed after the first dose). After 
vaccination, management is similar to that of 2-dose vaccine recipients.
Unvaccinated HCP who have no other evidence of immunity who are exposed to VZV
are potentially infective from 
days 10--21 after exposure and should be furloughed during this period. They should
receive postexposure vaccination as soon 
as possible. Vaccination within 3--5 days of exposure to rash might modify the disease
if infection occurred. Vaccination >5 
days  postexposure  still  is  indicated  because  it  induces  protection  against  subsequent
exposures (if the current 
exposure did not cause infection).
The risk for transmission of vaccine virus from vaccine 
recipients in whom varicella-like rash occurs after vaccination is 
low  and  has  been  documented  after  exposures  in  households  and  long-term  care
facilities 
(140,146--148). No cases have been documented after vaccination of HCP. The benefits
of vaccinating HCP without evidence of immunity outweigh 
this  extremely  low  potential  risk.  As  a  safeguard,  institutions  should  consider
precautions for personnel in whom rash occurs 
after vaccination. HCP in whom a vaccine-related rash occurs should avoid contact with
persons without 
evidence  of  immunity  who  are  at  risk  for  severe  disease  and  complications  until  all
lesions resolve (i.e., are crusted over or fade away) or no 
new lesions appear within a 24-hour period.
Varicella IgG Antibody Testing
The  tests  most  widely  used  to  detect  varicella  IgG  antibody  after  natural  varicella
infection among HCP are 
latex  agglutination  (LA)  and  ELISA.  A  commercially  available  LA  test  using  latex
particles coated with VZV glycoprotein 
antigens can be completed in 15 minutes and does not require special equipment 
(181). The sensitivity and specificity of the LA 
test  are  comparable  to  those  of  FAMA  in  detecting  antibody  response  after  natural
varicella infection. The LA test generally 
is more sensitive than commercial ELISAs. The LA test has detected antibody for up to
11 years after varicella vaccination 
(182). 
However, for the purpose of screening HCP for varicella susceptibility, a less sensitive
and more specific commercial 
ELISA should be considered. A recent report indicated that the LA test can 
produce false-positive results, particularly when only 
a single concentration of serum is evaluated 
(183); this led to documented cases of false-positive results in HCP 
who consequently remained unvaccinated and subsequently contracted varicella.
Vaccination for Outbreak Control
Varicella  vaccination  is  recommended  for  outbreak  control.  Persons  who  do  not  have
adequate evidence of immunity 
should  receive  their  first  or  second  dose  as  appropriate.  Additionally,  in  outbreaks
among preschool-aged children, 2-dose vaccination 
is  recommended  for  optimal  protection,  and  children  vaccinated  with  1  dose  should
receive their second dose provided 
3  months  have  elapsed  since  the  first  dose.  State  and  local  health  departments  may
advise exposed persons who do not have evidence 
of  immunity  to  contact  their  health-care  providers  for  vaccination,  or  they  may  offer
vaccination through the health department 
or  school  (or  other  institutions)  vaccination  clinics.  Although  outbreak  control  efforts
optimally should be implemented as soon 
as  an  outbreak  is  identified,  vaccination  should  be  offered  even  if  the  outbreak  is
identified late. Varicella outbreaks in 
certain  settings  (e.g.,  child  care  facilities,  schools,  or  institutions)  can  last  as  long  as
4--5 months. Thus, offering vaccine during 
an  outbreak  might  provide  protection  to  persons  not  yet  exposed  and  shorten  the
duration of the outbreak 
(184). Persons receiving either their first or second dose as part of the outbreak control
program may be readmitted to school 
immediately. Those vaccinated with the first dose as part of outbreak control measures
should be scheduled for the second dose as 
age  appropriate.  Persons  who  are  unvaccinated  and  without  other  evidence  of
immunity who do not receive vaccine should 
be excluded from institutions in which the outbreak is occurring until 21 days after the
onset of rash in the last case of varicella. 
In  addition,  for  school-aged  persons  covered  by  the  2-dose  school  vaccination
requirements, exclusion during an outbreak 
is recommended for those vaccine recipients who had 
received the first dose before the outbreak but not the second as part of 
the oubtreak control program. Persons at increased risk for severe varicella who have
contraindications to vaccination 
should receive VZIG within 96 hours of exposure.
Contraindications
General
Adequate  treatment  provisions  for  anaphylactic  reactions,  including  epinephrine
injection (1:1000), should be available 
for immediate use should an anaphylactic reaction occur. 
Before administering a vaccine, health-care providers should obtain 
the  vaccine  recipient's  vaccination  history  and  determine  whether  the  individual  had
any previous reactions to any 
vaccine  including  Varivax,  ProQuad  or  any  measles,  mumps,  or  rubella  containing
vaccines.
Allergy to Vaccine Components
The
 administration
 of
 live
 varicella-containing
 vaccines
 rarely
 results
 in
hypersensitivity. The information in the 
package insert should be reviewed carefully before vaccine is 
administered. Vaccination is contraindicated for persons who have 
a history of anaphylactic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin.
Single-antigen varicella vaccine does 
not contain preservatives or egg protein; these substances have caused hypersensitive
reactions to other vaccines. For 
the combination MMRV vaccine, live measles and live mumps vaccines are produced in
chick embryo culture. However, 
among  persons  who  are  allergic  to  eggs,  the  risk  for  serious  allergic  reactions  after
administration of measles- or 
mumps-containing vaccines is low. Because skin testing with vaccine is not predictive
of allergic reaction to vaccination, skin testing is 
not  required  before  administering  combination  MMRV  vaccine  to  persons  who  are
allergic to eggs 
(160). The majority of anaphylactic reactions to measles- and 
mumps-containing vaccines are associated not with hypersensitivity to egg antigens 
but  with  other  vaccine  components.  Neither  single-antigen  varicella  nor  combination
MMRV vaccines should be administered 
to  persons  who  have  a  history  of  anaphylactic  reaction  to  neomycin.  However,
neomycin allergy usually is manifested as a 
contact dermatitis, which is a delayed-type immune response rather than anaphylaxis.
For persons who experience such a response, 
the  adverse  reaction,  if  any,  would  appear  as  an  erythematous,  pruritic  nodule  or
papule present 48--96 hours after vaccination. 
A  history  of  contact  dermatitis  to  neomycin  is  not  a  contraindication  to  receiving
varicella vaccines.
Altered Immunity
Single-antigen  varicella  and  combination  MMRV  vaccines  are  not  licensed  for  use  in
persons who have any 
malignant condition, including blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or
other malignant neoplasms affecting the 
bone  marrow  or  lymphatic  systems.  Combination  MMRV  vaccine  should  not  be
administered to persons with primary or 
acquired  immunodeficiency,  including  immunosuppression  associated  with  AIDS  or
other clinical manifestations of HIV 
infections,
 cellular
 immunodeficiencies,
 hypogammaglobulinemia,
 and
dysgammaglobulinemia. Combination MMRV vaccine should 
not  be  administered  as  a  substitute  for  the  component  vaccines  when  vaccinating
HIV-infected children.
Varicella vaccines should not be administered to persons who have a family history of
congenital or 
hereditary immunodeficiency in first-degree relatives (e.g., parents and siblings) unless
the immune competence of the potential 
vaccine recipient has been clinically substantiated or verified by a 
laboratory.
Varicella vaccines should not be administered to persons receiving high-dose systemic
immunosuppressive 
therapy, including persons on oral steroids 
>2 mg/kg of body weight or a total of 
>20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for 
persons who weigh >10 kg, when administered for 
>2 weeks. Such persons are more susceptible to infections than healthy 
persons.  Administration  of  varicella  vaccines  can  result  in  a  more  extensive
vaccine-associated rash or disseminated disease in 
persons receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids 
(185). This contraindication does not apply 
to  persons  who  are  receiving  inhaled,  nasal,  or  topical  corticosteroids  or  low-dose
corticosteroids as are used 
commonly for asthma prophylaxis or for 
corticosteroid-replacement  therapy  (see  Situations  in  Which  Some  Degree  of
Immunodeficiency Might Be Present).
Pregnancy
Because the effects of the varicella virus vaccine on the fetus are unknown, pregnant
women should not be 
vaccinated. Nonpregnant women who are vaccinated should avoid 
becoming pregnant for 1 month after each injection. For 
persons without evidence of immunity, having a pregnant household member is not a
contraindication to vaccination. 
If a pregnant woman is vaccinated or becomes pregnant within 1 month of vaccination,
she should be counseled 
about  potential  effects  on  the  fetus.  Wild-type  varicella  poses  a  low  risk  to  the  fetus
(see Prenatal and Perinatal 
Exposure).  Because  the  virulence  of  the  attenuated  virus  used  in  the  vaccine  is  less
than that of the wild-type virus, the risk to the fetus, 
if any, should be even lower. In 1995, Merck and Co., Inc., in collaboration with CDC,
established the VARIVAX 
Pregnancy  Registry  to  monitor  the  maternal-fetal  outcomes  of  pregnant  women  who
were inadvertently administered 
varicella  vaccine  3  months  before  or  at  any  time  during  pregnancy  (to  report,  call:
1-800-986-8999) 
(186).  During  the  first  10  years  of  the  pregnancy  registry  no  cases  of  congenital
varicella syndrome or birth defects compatible with congenital varicella 
syndrome  have  been  documented  (187,188).  Among  131  live-born  infants  of
prospectively reported seronegative women (82 of 
whom were born to mothers vaccinated during the highest risk period [i.e., the first or
second trimester of pregnancy]), no 
birth  defects  consistent  with  congenital  varicella  syndrome  have  been  documented
(prevalence 
rate = 0; CI = 0--6.7%), and three major birth defects were reported (prevalence rate =
2.3%; CI = 0.5%--6.7%). The rate of occurrence of major birth 
defects from prospective reports in the registry was similar to the rate reported in the
general U.S. population (3.2%), and the 
defects indicated no specific pattern or target organ. Although the study results do not
exclude the possibility of risk for women 
who  received  inadvertent  varicella  vaccination  before  or  during  pregnancy,  the
potential risk, if any, is low.
Precautions
Illness
Vaccination of persons who have acute severe illness, 
including untreated, active tuberculosis, should be postponed 
until recovery. The decision to delay vaccination depends on the severity of symptoms
and on the etiology of the disease. No 
data  are  available  regarding  whether  either  single-antigen  varicella  or  combination
MMRV vaccines exacerbate tuberculosis. 
Live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccines administered individually
might result in a temporary depression 
of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should
be administered either any time 
before,  simultaneously  with,  or  at  least  4--6  weeks  after  combination  MMRV  vaccine.
However, tuberculin skin testing is not 
a  prerequisite  for  vaccination  with  single-antigen  varicella  or  combination  MMRV
vaccines.
Varicella vaccines may be administered to children without evidence of immunity who
have mild illnesses, with or 
without low-grade fever (e.g., diarrhea or upper-respiratory infection) 
(189). Physicians should be alert to the 
vaccine-associated  temperature  elevations  that  might  occur  predominantly  in  the
second week after vaccination, especially with 
combination  MMRV  vaccine.  Studies  suggest  that  failure  to  vaccinate  children  with
minor illnesses can impede 
vaccination efforts (190).
Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia is not a contraindication for 
single-antigen varicella vaccine. No clinical data are available regarding 
the  development  or  worsening  of  thrombocytopenia  in  persons  vaccinated  with
combination MMRV vaccine. Cases 
of  thrombocytopenia  have  been  reported  after  MMR  vaccine  and  after  varicella
vaccination. Postmarketing experience with 
live  MMR  vaccine  indicates  that  persons  with  thrombocytopenia  might  develop  more
severe thrombocytopenia after 
vaccination.  For  vaccination  of  thrombocytopenic  children  with  combination  MMRV
vaccine, health-care providers should refer to 
the ACIP recommendations on MMR vaccination 
(160).
Recent Administration of Blood, Plasma, or Immune Globulin
Although  passively  acquired  antibody  is  known  to  interfere  with  response  to  measles
and rubella vaccines 
(191), the effect of the administration of immune globulin (IG) on the 
response to varicella virus vaccine is unknown. The duration 
of  interference  with  the  response  to  measles  vaccination  is  dose-related  and  ranges
from 3--11 months. Because of the 
potential  inhibition  of  the  response  to  varicella  vaccination  by  passively  transferred
antibodies, varicella vaccines should not 
be administered for the same intervals as measles vaccine (3--11 months, depending
on the dosage) after 
administration  of  blood  (except  washed  red  blood  cells),  plasma,  or  IG.  Suggested
intervals between administration of antibody-containing 
products for different indications and varicella vaccine have been published previously 
(157). In addition, persons who received a varicella vaccine should not be administered
an antibody-containing product for 2 weeks after vaccination unless the 
benefits exceed those of vaccination. In such cases, the vaccine recipient should either
be 
revaccinated or tested for immunity at the appropriate intervals, depending on the dose
received, and then revaccinated if seronegative. 
Use of Salicylates
No  adverse  events  associated  with  the  use  of  salicylates  after  varicella  vaccination
have been reported; however, the 
vaccine manufacturer recommends that vaccine recipients avoid 
using salicylates for 6 weeks after receiving varicella vaccines 
because  of  the  association  between  aspirin  use  and  Reye  syndrome  after  varicella.
Vaccination with subsequent close monitoring 
should  be  considered  for  children  who  have  rheumatoid  arthritis  or  other  conditions
requiring therapeutic aspirin. The risk for 
serious complications associated with aspirin is likely to be greater in children in whom
natural varicella develops than it is in 
children who receive the vaccine containing attenuated 
VZV. No association has been documented between Reye syndrome 
and analgesics or antipyretics that do not contain salicylic acid.
Postexposure Prophylaxis
Healthy Persons
Prelicensure data from the United States and Japan on varicella exposures in children
from household, hospital, 
and  community  settings  indicate  that  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  is  effective  in
preventing illness or modifying varicella 
severity  if  administered  to  unvaccinated  children  within  3  days,  and  possibly  up  to  5
days, of exposure to rash 
(78,101,192). Vaccination within 3 days of exposure to rash was 
>90% effective in preventing varicella whereas vaccination within 5 days 
of exposure to rash was approximately 70% effective in preventing varicella and 100%
effective in modifying severe 
disease (101,192). Limited postlicensure studies also have demonstrated that varicella
vaccine is highly effective in either preventing 
or modifying disease if administered within 3 days of exposure 
(193,194). Varicella vaccine is recommended for 
postexposure  administration  for  unvaccinated  persons  without  other  evidence  of
immunity. If exposure to VZV does not cause 
infection,  postexposure  vaccination  should  induce  protection  against  subsequent
exposures. If the exposure results in infection, 
no 
evidence  indicates  that  administration  of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  during  the
presymptomatic or prodromal stage 
of illness increases the risk for vaccine-associated 
adverse events. No data are available regarding the potential benefit 
of administering a second dose to 1-dose vaccine recipients after exposure. However,
administration of a second dose should 
be  considered  for  persons  who  have  previously  received  1  dose  to  bring  them
up-to-date. Studies on postexposure use of 
varicella  vaccine  have  been  conducted  exclusively  in  children.  A  higher  proportion  of
adults do not respond to the first dose of 
varicella  vaccine.  Nevertheless,  postexposure  vaccination  should  be  offered  to  adults
without evidence of immunity. 
Although  postexposure  use  of  varicella  vaccine  has  potential  applications  in  hospital
settings, vaccination is recommended routinely 
for  all  HCP  without  evidence  of  immunity  and  is  the  preferred  method  for  preventing
varicella in health-care settings 
(195). Preferably, HCP should be vaccinated when they begin employment. No data are
available on the use of combination 
MMRV raccine for postexposure prophylaxis.
Persons Without Evidence of Immunity Who Have Contraindications 
for Vaccination and Who Are at Risk for Severe Disease and Complications
Studies  conducted  in  1969  indicated  that  clinical  varicella  was  prevented  in
nonimmune, healthy children by 
the administration of zoster immune globulin (ZIG) (prepared from patients recovering
from HZ) within 72 hours of 
exposure (196). ZIG also lowered attack rates among immunocompromised persons if
administered no later than 96 hours 
after  exposure  (196).  VZIG  (prepared  from  plasma  obtained  from  healthy,  volunteer
blood donors identified by routine 
screening to have high antibody titers to VZV) became 
available in 1978. Both serologic and clinical evaluations have demonstrated 
that  the  product  is  equivalent  to  ZIG  in  preventing  or  modifying  clinical  illness  in
non-immune, immunocompromised 
persons who are exposed to varicella 
(197,198).  In  a  study  of  immunocompromised  children  who  were  administered  VZIG
within 
96 hours of exposure, approximately one in five exposures resulted in clinical varicella,
and one in 20 resulted in 
subclinical disease (198). The severity of clinical varicella (evaluated by percentage of 
patients with >100 lesions or complications) 
was lower than expected on the basis of historic controls.
The VZIG product currently used in the United States, 
VariZIG™(Cangene Corporation, Winnipeg, Canada), is 
available under an Investigational New Drug Application 
Expanded Access protocol (available at 
http://www.fda.gov/cber/infosheets/mphvzig020806.htm).  A  request  for  licensure  in
the United States might be submitted to FDA in the 
future.  VariZIG  is  a  lyophilized  presentation  which,  when  properly  reconstituted,  is
approximately a 5% solution of IgG that can be 
administered intramuscularly (199). VariZIG can be 
obtained 24 hours a day from the sole authorized U.S. 
distributor (FFF Enterprises, Temecula, California) at 1-800-843-7477 or online at 
http://www.fffenterprises.com.
Administration of VZIG
VZIG provides maximum benefit when administered as soon as possible after exposure,
but it might be effective 
if  administered  as  late  as  96  hours  after  exposure.  The  effectiveness  of  VZIG  when
administered >96 hours after 
initial  exposure  has  not  been  evaluated.  The  duration  of  protection  provided  after
administration of VZIG is unknown, 
but protection should last at least one half-life of the IG (i.e., 
approximately 3 weeks). Susceptible persons at high risk for 
whom varicella vaccination is contraindicated and who are again exposed 
>3 weeks after receiving a dose of VZIG should 
receive  another  full  dose  of  VZIG.  Patients  receiving  monthly  high-dose  immune
globulin intravenous (IGIV) 
(>400  mg/kg)  are  likely  to  be  protected  and  probably  do  not  require  VZIG  if  the  last
dose of IGIV was administered <3 weeks before 
exposure (200). VZIG has not been proven to be useful in treating clinical varicella or
HZ or in preventing disseminated zoster and 
is not recommended for such use. VZIG might extend the incubation period of the virus
from 10--21 days to 
>28  days.  This  should  be  taken  into  account  after  exposures  when  VZIG  is
administered.
Dosage
VariZIG is supplied in 125-U vials. The recommended dose is 125 units/10 kg of body
weight, up to a maximum of 
625 units (five vials). The minimum dose is 125 U. The human IgG content is 60--200
mg per 125 units dose of VariZIG.
Indications for the Use of VZIG for Postexposure Prophylaxis
The decision to administer VZIG depends on three factors: 1) whether the patient lacks
evidence of immunity, 2) 
whether  the  exposure  is  likely  to  result  in  infection,  and  3)  whether  the  patient  is  at
greater risk for complications than the 
general population.
Both healthy and immunocompromised children and adults who have verified positive
histories of varicella (except 
for  bone-marrow  transplant  recipients)  may  be  considered  immune  (see  Evidence  of
Immunity). The association between 
positive  histories  of  varicella  in  bone-marrow  donors  and  susceptibility  to  varicella  in
recipients after transplants has not been 
studied  adequately.  Thus,  persons  who  receive  bone-marrow  transplants  should  be
considered nonimmune, regardless of 
previous  history  of  varicella  disease  or  varicella  vaccination  in  themselves  or  in  their
donors. Bone-marrow recipients in whom 
varicella  or  HZ  develops  after  transplantation  should  subsequently  be  considered
immune.
VZIG is not indicated for persons who received 2 doses of varicella vaccine and became
immunocompromised as a 
result of disease or treatment later in life. These persons should be monitored closely; if
disease occurs, treatment with acyclovir 
should be instituted at the earliest signs or symptoms. For patients without evidence of
immunity and on steroid therapy doses 
>2 mg/kg of body weight or a total of 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, VariZIG is
indicated.
Types of Exposure
Certain types of exposure can place persons without evidence of immunity at risk for
varicella. Direct contact exposure 
is defined as face-to-face contact with an infectious person while indoors. The duration
of face-to-face contact that 
warrants  administration  of  VZIG  is  not  certain.  However,  the  contact  should  not  be
transient. Certain experts suggest a contact of 
>5 minutes as constituting significant exposure for this purpose, whereas others define
close contact as >1 hour 
(200). Substantial exposure for hospital contacts consists of sharing the same hospital
room with an infectious patient or direct, 
face-to-face  contact  with  an  infectious  person  (e.g.,  HCP).  Brief  contacts  with  an
infectious person (e.g., contact with x-ray technicians 
or housekeeping personnel) are less likely than more 
prolonged contacts to result in VZV transmission.
Persons  with  continuous  exposure  to  household  members  who  have  varicella  or
disseminated HZ are at greatest risk 
for infection. Varicella occurs in approximately 85% (range: 65%--100%) of susceptible
household contacts exposed to 
VZV. Localized HZ is much less infectious than varicella or disseminated HZ 
(52). Transmission from localized HZ is more 
likely  after  close  contact,  such  as  in  household  settings.  Physicians  may  consider
recommending postexposure prophylaxis 
with  VZIG  in  such  circumstances.  After  household  exposure  to  varicella,  attack  rates
among immunocompromised children 
who were administered VZIG were up to 60% 
(197). No comparative data are available for immunocompromised 
children without evidence of immunity who were not administered VZIG. However, the
incidence of severe disease 
(defined as >100 skin lesions) was less than that predicted from the natural history of
disease in normal children (27% and 87%, 
respectively), and the incidence of pneumonia was less than that described in children
with neoplasm (6% and 25%, respectively) 
(201). The risk for varicella after close contact (e.g., contact with playmates) or hospital
exposure is estimated to be 
approximately 20% of the risk occurring from household exposure.
The  attack  rate  in  healthy  neonates  who  were  exposed  in  utero  within  7  days  of
delivery and who received VZIG after 
birth was 62%, which does not differ substantially from rates reported for neonates who
were similarly exposed but not treated 
with  VZIG  (49).  However,  the  occurrence  of  complications  and  fatal  outcomes  was
substantially lower for neonates who 
were treated with VZIG than for those who were not.
In a study of pregnant women without immunity to VZV who were exposed to varicella
and administered VZIG, 
the infection rate was 30%. This is substantially lower than the expected rate of >70%
in unimmunized women exposed 
to varicella (199,202).
Recommendations for the Use of VZIG
The  following  patient  groups  are  at  risk  for  severe  disease  and  complications  from
varicella and should receive VZIG:
Immunocompromised  patients.  VZIG  is  used  primarily  for  passive  immunization  of
immunocompromised 
persons without evidence of immunity after direct exposure to varicella or disseminated
HZ patients, including persons who 1) 
have primary and acquired immune-deficiency disorders, 2) have neoplastic diseases,
and 3) are receiving 
immunosuppressive 
treatment. Patients receiving monthly high-dose IGIV 
(>400 mg/kg) are likely to be protected and probably do not 
require VZIG if the last dose of IGIV was administered 
<3 weeks before exposure (200).
Neonates whose mothers have signs and symptoms of varicella around the time of 
delivery.  VZIG  is  indicated  for  neonates  whose  mothers  have  signs  and  symptoms  of
varicella from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery. VZIG is 
not necessary for neonates whose mothers have signs and symptoms of varicella more
than 5 days before delivery, because 
those  infants  should  be  protected  from  severe  varicella  by  transplacentally  acquired
maternal antibody. No evidence suggests 
that infants born to mothers in whom varicella occurs >48 hours after delivery are at
increased risk for serious complications 
(e.g., pneumonia or death).
Premature  neonates  exposed  postnatally.  Transmission  of  varicella  in  the  hospital
nursery is rare because the majority 
of neonates are protected by maternal antibody. Premature 
infants who have substantial postnatal exposure should be 
evaluated  on  an  individual  basis.  The  risk  for  complications  of  postnatally  acquired
varicella in premature infants is 
unknown.  However,  because  the  immune  system  of  premature  infants  is  not  fully
developed, administration of VZIG to premature infants born 
at  >28  weeks  of  gestation  who  are  exposed  during  the  neonatal  period  and  whose
mothers do not have evidence of immunity 
is indicated. Premature infants born at <28 weeks of gestation or who weigh 
<1,000 g at birth and were exposed during 
the neonatal period should receive VZIG regardless of maternal immunity because such
infants might not have acquired 
maternal antibody. The majority of premature infants born at 
>28 weeks of gestation to immune mothers have enough 
acquired maternal antibody to protect them from severe disease and complications. 
Although  infants  are  at  higher  risk  than  older  children  for  serious  and  fatal
complications, the risk for healthy, full-term infants who have varicella after postnatal
exposure 
is substantially less than that for infants whose mothers were infected 
5 days before to 2 days after delivery. VZIG is 
not  recommended  for  healthy,  full-term  infants  who  are  exposed  postnatally,  even  if
their mothers have no history of 
varicella infection.
Pregnant women. Because pregnant women might be at higher risk for severe varicella
and complications 
(37,42,203), VZIG should be strongly considered for pregnant women without evidence
of immunity who have been 
exposed.  Administration  of  VZIG  to  these  women  has  not  been  found  to  prevent
viremia, fetal infection, congenital varicella 
syndrome,  or  neonatal  varicella.  Thus,  the  primary  indication  for  VZIG  in  pregnant
women is to prevent complications of 
varicella in the mother rather than to protect the fetus. 
Neonates born to mothers who have signs and symptoms of varicella from 5 
days  before  to  2  days  after  delivery  should  receive  VZIG,  regardless  of  whether  the
mother received VZIG.
Interval Between Administration of VZIG and Varicella Vaccine
Any  patient  who  receives  VZIG  to  prevent  varicella  should  receive  varicella  vaccine
subsequently, provided the vaccine is 
not contraindicated. Varicella vaccination should be delayed until 5 months after VZIG
administration. Varicella vaccine is 
not needed if the patient has varicella after administration of VZIG.
Antiviral Therapy
Because VZIG might prolong the incubation period by 
>1 week, any patient who receives VZIG should be observed 
closely for signs or symptoms of varicella for 28 days after exposure. Antiviral therapy
should be instituted immediately if signs 
or  symptoms  of  varicella  disease  occur.  The  route  and  duration  of  antiviral  therapy
should be determined by specific host 
factors, extent of infection, and initial response to therapy. Information regarding how
to obtain VariZIG is available at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5508a5.htm

 Two  live,  attenuated  varicella  zoster  virus--containing  vaccines  are  available  in  the
United States for prevention of 
varicella: 1) a single-antigen varicella vaccine 
(VARIVAX,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), which was licensed 
in the United States in 1995 for use among healthy children aged 
>12 months, adolescents, and adults; and 2) a 
combination measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine 
(ProQuad,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey), which 
was  licensed  in  the  United  States  in  2005  for  use  among  healthy  children  aged  12
months--12 years. Initial Advisory 
Committee  on  Immunization  Practices  (ACIP)  recommendations  for  prevention  of
varicella issued in 1995 (CDC. Prevention 
of  varicella:  recommendations  of  the  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization  Practices
[ACIP]. MMWR 1996;45[No. 
RR-11])  included  routine  vaccination  of  children  aged  12--18  months,  catch-up
vaccination of susceptible children aged 19 
months--12 years, and vaccination of susceptible persons who have close contact with
persons at high risk for serious complications 
(e.g., health-care personnel and family contacts of immunocompromised persons). One
dose of vaccine was recommended 
for children aged 12 months--12 years and 2 doses, 4--8 weeks apart, for persons aged 
>13 years. In 1999, ACIP updated the recommendations (CDC. Prevention of varicella:
updated recommendations of the Advisory Committee on 
Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 1999;48[No. RR-6]) to include establishing child
care and school entry requirements, use of 
the vaccine following exposure and for outbreak control, use of the vaccine for certain
children infected with 
human immunodeficiency virus, and vaccination of adolescents and adults at high risk
for exposure or transmission. 
 In June 2005 and June 2006, ACIP adopted new recommendations regarding the use of
live, attenuated varicella 
vaccines for prevention of varicella. This report revises, updates, and replaces the 1996
and 1999 ACIP statements for prevention 
of varicella. The new recommendations include 1) implementation of a routine 2-dose
varicella vaccination program 
for children, with the first dose administered at age 12--15 months and the second dose
at age 4--6 years; 2) a second dose 
catch-up varicella vaccination for children, adolescents, and adults who previously had
received 1 dose; 3) routine vaccination of 
all  healthy  persons  aged  >13  years  without  evidence  of  immunity;  4)  prenatal
assessment and postpartum vaccination; 
5) expanding the use of the varicella vaccine for HIV-infected children with age-specific
CD4+T lymphocyte percentages of 
15%--24% and adolescents and adults with CD4+T lymphocyte counts 
>200 cells/µL; and 6) establishing middle school, 
high school, and college entry vaccination requirements. ACIP also approved criteria for
evidence of immunity to varicella.
Introduction
 Varicella  is  a  highly  infectious  disease  caused  by  the  varicella-zoster  virus  (VZV).
Secondary attack rates for this virus 
might reach 90% for susceptible household contacts. VZV causes a systemic infection
that results typically in lifetime immunity. 
In otherwise healthy persons, clinical illness after reexposure is rare.
 In 1995, a vaccine to prevent varicella 
(VARIVAX,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) was licensed 
in the United States for use among healthy children aged 
>12 months, adolescents, and adults; recommendations of the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
regarding use of the varicella vaccine have been published previously 
(1,2) This report revises, updates, and replaces earlier ACIP statements 
(Table 1).
Methods
 In  response  to  increasing  reports  of  varicella  outbreaks  among  highly  vaccinated
populations 
(3--6),  ACIP's  measles-mumps-rubella  and  varicella  (MMRV)  workgroup  first  met  in
February 2004 to review data related to varicella vaccine use in 
the  United  States  since  implementation  of  the  vaccination  program  in  1995  and  to
consider recommendation options 
for improving control of varicella disease. The workgroup held monthly conference calls
and met in person three times a year. 
The  workgroup  reviewed  data  on  the  impact  of  the  1-dose  varicella  vaccination
program, including data on vaccination 
coverage,  changes  in  varicella  epidemiology,  transmission  from  vaccinated  persons
with varicella, vaccine effectiveness, 
immune  response  to  vaccination,  evidence  of  immunity,  and  potential  risk  factors  for
vaccine failure. Published and 
unpublished data related to correlates of protection, safety, immunogenicity, and 
efficacy† of the new quadrivalent MMRV vaccine and 
the  immunogenicity  and  efficacy  of  a  second  dose  of  varicella  vaccine  also  were
reviewed. 
Cost-benefit  and  cost-effectiveness  analyses  were  considered,  including  revised
cost-benefit analysis of both the 1- and 2-dose programs for children 
compared with no vaccination program and the incremental benefit of a second dose.
Presentations were made to the full ACIP 
meetings in October 2004, February 2005, June 2005, and June 2006. Recommendation
options were developed and discussed by 
the
 MMRV
 workgroup.
 When
 definitive
 research
 evidence
 was
 lacking,
 the
recommendations incorporated expert opinion of 
the workgroup members. The workgroup sought input from partner organizations (i.e.,
the American Academy of 
Pediatrics  [AAP],  the  American  Academy  of  Family  Physicians  [AAFP],  the  American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 
the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and the 
Association of Immunization Managers) and from state public 
health professionals and immunization program directors. Proposed recommendations
and a draft statement were presented to 
the  full  ACIP  in  June  2005  and  June  2006.  After  deliberations,  final  ACIP
recommendations were approved in 2005 and 
2006.  Modifications  to  the  draft  statement  were  made  following  CDC  and  external
review process to update and clarify wording 
in the document.
Epidemiology of Varicella
General
 VZV is transmitted from person to person by direct contact, inhalation of aerosols from
vesicular fluid of skin lesions 
of acute varicella or zoster, or infected respiratory tract secretions that also might be
aerosolized. The virus enters the 
host through the upper-respiratory tract or the conjunctiva.
 The average incubation period for varicella is 14--16 
days§ after exposure to rash; however, this period can vary (range: 
10--21  days).  The  period  of  contagiousness  of  infected  persons  is  estimated  to  begin
1--2 days before the onset of rash and to 
end when all lesions are crusted, typically 4--7 days after onset of rash 
(7). Persons who have progressive varicella 
(i.e., development of new lesions for >7 days) might be contagious longer, presumably
because their immune response is 
depressed, which allows viral replication to persist. VZV 
remains dormant in sensory-nerve ganglia and might be 
reactivated  at  a  later  time,  causing  herpes  zoster  (HZ)  (i.e.,  shingles),  a  painful
vesicular rash typically appearing in a dermatomal distribution 
of one or two sensory-nerve roots.
 Since implementation of a universal childhood varicella vaccination program in 1995,
the epidemiology and 
clinical characteristics of varicella in the United States have changed, with substantial
declines in morbidity and mortality 
attributable  to  varicella.  No  consistent  changes  in  HZ  epidemiology  have  been
documented.
 Vaccinated  persons  might  develop  modified  varicella  disease  with  atypical
presentation. Varicella disease that develops 
>42 days after vaccination (i.e., breakthrough varicella) typically is mild, with <50 skin
lesions, low or no fever, and shorter 
(4--6  days)  duration  of  illness.  The  rash  is  more  likely  to  be  predominantly
maculopapular rather than vesicular. 
Nevertheless, breakthrough varicella is contagious.
Prevaccine Era
 Before the introduction of varicella vaccine in 1995, varicella was a universal childhood
disease in the United States, 
with peak incidence in the spring and an average annual incidence of 15--16 cases per
1,000 population. On the basis of data 
from  the  National  Health  Interview  Survey  (NHIS)  for  1980--1990,  an  average  of  4
million cases were estimated to have 
occurred 
annually (annual incidence rate: 15 cases per 1,000 population) 
(8). Varicella was not a nationally notifiable disease 
when vaccine was introduced in 1995, and surveillance data were limited. In 1994, only
28 states, the District of Columbia, 
and  New  York  City  reported  cases  to  CDC's  National  Notifiable  Disease  Surveillance
System (NNDSS); reporting was 
passive, with estimated completeness ranging from <0.1% to 20% 
(9).
 In multiple studies, age-specific incidence data were derived from NHIS and from state
and local surveys 
(8,10,11).  During  1980--1990,  an  estimated  33%  of  cases  occurred  among
preschool-aged children (i.e., children aged 12 months--4 years), 
and 44% occurred among school-aged children (i.e., children aged 5--9 years) (annual
incidence rates: 82.8 and 91.1 cases 
per  1,000  children,  respectively).  Approximately  90%--92%  of  cases  occurred  among
persons aged <15 years, and cases 
occurred  rarely  among  persons  aged  >50  years.  However,  studies  using  data  from
state and local surveys conducted during 
1990--1992  and  during  1994--1995  indicated  that  the  highest  incidence  of  varicella
occurred among preschool-aged rather than 
school-aged children, indicating that the disease was being acquired at earlier ages 
(10,11). National seroprevalence data for 
1988--1994  indicated  that  95.5%  of  adults  aged  20--29  years,  98.9%  of  adults  aged
30--39 years, and >99.6% of adults aged 
>40 years were immune to VZV (12). However, for reasons that are not well 
understood, the epidemiology of varicella differs between countries with temperate and
tropical climates 
(13--18). In the majority of countries with temperate climates, 
>90%  of  persons  are  infected  by  adolescence  whereas  in  countries  with  tropical
climates, a higher 
proportion of infections are acquired at older ages, which results in higher susceptibility
among adults 
(19).
 Estimates  of  the  burden  of  varicella  hospitalization  varied  according  to  the  year(s)
studied, the source of data, and 
the  definitions  used  for  a  varicella-related  hospitalization  (20--23).  Estimates  were
higher if varicella was listed as either a 
principal  or  a  secondary  cause  of  hospitalization,  in  which  case  some  incidental
varicella hospitalization might have been 
included.  During  1988--1995,  an  estimated  10,632  hospitalizations  were  attributable
annually to varicella in the United States 
(range: 8,198--16,586) (20). Another study demonstrated an annual average of 15,073
hospitalizations during 1993--1995, but 
this period might have included an epidemic year 
(22). Overall rates of hospitalization for varicella during 1988--1995 
ranged from 2.3 to 6.0 cases per 100,000 population. If any 
varicella-related hospital discharge diagnostic code was included, 
rates varied between 5.0 and 7.0 cases per 100,000 population 
(20--23).
 During 1988--1995, persons without severe 
immuno-compromising conditions or treatments comprised the 
largest proportion (89%) of annual varicella-related hospitalizations 
(20). Before vaccination, children aged 
<4 years accounted for 43%--44% of hospitalizations, and persons aged 
>20 years accounted for 32%--33% 
(20,22). The rate of complications from varicella was substantially higher for 
persons aged >20 years and for infants (i.e., children aged 
<1  year).  Adults  aged  >20  years  were  13  times  more  likely  to  be  hospitalized  when
they had varicella than children aged 
5--9 years, and infants aged <1 year were six times more likely to be hospitalized than
children aged 5--9 years 
(20). The most common complications of 
varicella that resulted in hospitalizations were skin and soft tissue infections (especially
invasive group A streptococcal 
infections),  pneumonia,  dehydration,  and  encephalitis.  In  1980,  an  association  was
identified between Reye syndrome and the use 
of  aspirin  during  varicella  or  influenza-like  illness;  since  then,  Reye  syndrome,  which
was once considered a 
common complication resulting from varicella infection, has become rare 
(24--26).
 During  1970--1994,  the  average  annual  number  of  deaths  for  which  varicella  was
recorded as the underlying cause was 
105;  the  overall  average  annual  varicella  mortality  rate  was  0.4  deaths  per  1  million
population. The age distribution of 
varicella deaths has shifted during this period. During 1970--1974, persons aged <20
years accounted for 80% of varicella 
deaths,  compared  with  46%  during  1990--1994.  During  1970--1994,  the  average
case-fatality rate (CFR) for varicella for all 
ages  combined  ranged  from  2.0  to  3.6  per  100,000  cases,  with  higher  rates  among
infants and adults aged 
>20  years  (27).  Although  CFRs  declined  substantially  during  this  period,  the  risk  for
varicella-related death during 1990--1994 was still 
25 times higher for adults than for children aged 12 months--4 years (CFR: 21.3 and 0.8
per 100,000 cases, 
respectively). During the same period, 89% of varicella deaths among children and 75%
of varicella deaths among adults occurred in 
persons without severe underlying immunocompromising medical conditions. The most
common complications among persons 
who died of varicella were pneumonia, central nervous system complications (including
encephalitis), secondary infection, 
and hemorrhagic conditions. A recent reanalysis of varicella deaths also considered 
varicella  when  listed  as  a  contributing  cause  of  death  in  addition  to  the  underlying
cause studied in the previous report 
(28). During 1990--1994, a varicella diagnosis was 
listed on an average of 145 death certificates per year (105 as an underlying cause and
40 as a contributing cause), with an 
overall annual varicella mortality rate of 0.6 deaths per 1 million 
population.
 Varicella during pregnancy can have adverse consequences for the fetus and infant,
including congenital varicella 
syndrome (see Prenatal and Perinatal Exposure). Reliable data on the number of cases
of congenital varicella syndrome are not 
available.  However,  on  the  basis  of  age-specific  varicella  incidence  (from  NHIS),  the
annual number of births, and the risk 
for congenital varicella syndrome (1.1% overall risk in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy),
44 cases of congenital 
varicella  syndrome  are  estimated  to  have  occurred  each  year  in  the  United  States
during the prevaccine era 
(29).
Postvaccine Era
 In 1995, a varicella vaccine 
(VARIVAX,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) was licensed in the 
United States for use among healthy children aged 
>12 months, adolescents, and adults. At that time, ACIP recommended 
routine  varicella  vaccination  of  children  aged  12--18  months,  catch-up  vaccination  of
susceptible children aged 19 months--12 
years, and vaccination of susceptible persons who have close contact with persons at
high risk for serious complications (e.g., 
health-care workers and family contacts of 
immunocompromised
 persons)
 (1;
 Table
 1).
 In
 1999,
 ACIP
 updated
 the
recommendations 
to include child care and school entry requirements, use of the vaccine after exposure
and for outbreak control, use of the vaccine 
for certain children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and vaccination
of adolescents and adults at high risk 
for exposure or transmission (2; Table 1).
 During  1997--2005,  national  varicella  vaccination  coverage  among  children  aged
19--35 months increased from 27% 
to 88%, with no statistically significant difference in coverage by race or ethnicity 
(30). In 2005, state-specific varicella vaccination coverage ranged from 69% to 96% 
(31). National surveillance data continue to be limited, but passive 
surveillance data in certain states have documented a decline in 
varicella incidence.
 In four states (Illinois, Michigan, Texas, and West Virginia) with adequate 
(>5% of expected cases during 
1990--1994)  reporting  to  NNDSS,  varicella  incidence  for  2004  declined  53%--88%
compared with the average incidence for 
1990--1994,  with  vaccination  coverage  among  children  aged  19--35  months  ranging
from 82% to 88% 
(32; CDC, unpublished data, 2006). During 2003--2005, the number of cases increased
in Illinois and Texas; the biggest increase (56%) occurred in 
Texas  (Figure  1).  The  number  of  cases  remained  stable  in  Michigan  (Figure  1)  and
declined minimally in West Virginia. 
 In 1995, along with implementation of the national vaccination program, CDC instituted
active surveillance for varicella 
in  three  communities  (Antelope  Valley,  California;  Travis  County,  Texas;  and  West
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) in 
collaboration with state and local health departments to establish baseline data and to
monitor trends in varicella disease after 
introduction of varicella vaccine. By 2000, vaccination coverage among children 19--35
months in these three communities had 
reached 74%--84%, and reported total varicella cases had declined 71%--84% 
(33). Although incidence declined to the greatest 
extent (83%--90%) among children aged 12 months--4 years, incidence declined in all
age groups, including infants and 
adults,  indicating  the  herd  immunity  effects  of  the  vaccination  program.  Since  2001,
only two sites were funded to 
continue  surveillance  (Antelope  Valley  and  West  Philadelphia).  By  2005,  vaccination
coverage in these two sites had increased to 
90%, and the reduction in incidence had reached 90% and 91%, respectively 
(34). During 1996--2005, as vaccination 
coverage continued to increase, the proportion of persons with varicella who had been
vaccinated increased from 2% to 56%. 
During 1995--2004, peak incidence for varicella cases in active surveillance sites shifted
from age 3--6 years to age 9--11 years.
 After introduction of vaccine in 1995, the number and rate of annual varicella-related
hospitalizations declined. In 
one study of a nationally representative sample that was conducted during 1993--2001,
varicella hospitalizations declined 
75%  (22).  In  another  study,  the  annual  varicella-related  hospitalization  rate  declined
88% during 1994--2002 
(23) (Figure 2). Hospitalization rates declined 100% among 
infants, and substantial declines also were recorded in all other age groups (up 
to age 50 years); hospitalization rates declined 91% among children aged <10 years,
92% among children and adolescents 
aged 10--19 years, and 78% among adults aged 20--49 years. The greater decline in
hospitalizations among children led to 
an increase in the proportion of varicella-related 
hospitalizations among adults (40% of hospitalizations in 2002 occurred 
among persons aged >20 years) (23). In the 
combined active surveillance area, varicella-related hospitalizations declined from 
2.4--4.2 hospitalizations per 100,000 population during 1995--1998 to 1.5 per 100,000
population in 2000 
(33) and to 0.8 per 100,000 population in 2005 
(34).
 During  1995--2001,  the  number  of  deaths  for  which  varicella  was  listed  as  the
underlying cause decreased from 115 to 
26 (28) (Figure 3). Since then, the number of deaths declined further; 16 deaths were
reported in 2003. Age-adjusted 
mortality rates decreased 66%, from an average of 0.41 deaths per 1 million population
during 1990--1994 to 0.14 during 
1999--2001. The decline was observed in all age groups <50 years, with the greatest
reduction (92%) occurring among children aged 
12 
months--4 years (0.09 deaths per 1 million population), followed by an 88% reduction
among children aged 5--9 years 
(0.10 deaths per 1 million population). Deaths among persons aged 
>50 years did not decline to the same extent; however, 
the validity of reported varicella deaths in this age group is low 
(35), and the majority of these deaths are not considered to 
be caused by varicella. During 1999--2001, the average rate of mortality attributed to
varicella among all racial and 
ethnic populations was <0.15 deaths per 1 million persons. Persons without high-risk
conditions (e.g., 
malignancies, HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], and other 
immune deficiencies) accounted for 92% of deaths attributable 
to varicella. The average rates of deaths for which varicella was listed as a contributing
cause of death also 
declined during 1999--2001, compared with 1990--1994. 
 Despite high 1-dose vaccination coverage and the success of the vaccination program
in reducing varicella morbidity 
and mortality, reports to CDC from active surveillance sites and from states with 
well-implemented vaccination programs and surveillance indicate that in certain states
and in one 
active surveillance site, the number of reported varicella cases 
has remained constant or declined minimally, and outbreaks have continued to occur.
During 2001--2005, outbreaks 
were reported in schools with high varicella vaccination coverage (range 96%--100%) 
(3,4). The outbreaks were similar in 
certain  respects:  1)  all  occurred  in  elementary  schools,  2)  vaccine  effectiveness  was
similar (range: 72%--85%), 3) the highest 
attack  rates  occurred  among  the  younger  students,  4)  each  outbreak  lasted
approximately 
2  months,  and  5)  index  cases  occurred  among  vaccinated  students  (although  their
disease was mild). Overall attack rates among vaccinated children varied 
(range: 11%--17%), with attack rates in certain classrooms as high as 40%. These data
indicate that even in settings in 
which vaccination coverage was nearly universal and vaccine performed as expected,
the 1-dose vaccination program could 
not prevent varicella outbreaks completely.
Prenatal and Perinatal Exposure
 In  the  prevaccine  era,  prenatal  infection  was  uncommon  because  the  majority  of
women of childbearing age 
were immune to VZV (12,36). Varicella in pregnant women is 
associated with a risk for VZV transmission to the fetus or 
newborn.  Intrauterine  VZV  infection  might  result  in  congenital  varicella  syndrome,
neonatal varicella, or HZ during 
infancy or early childhood (37--46). Infants who are 
exposed prenatally to VZV, even if asymptomatic, might have measurable 
varicella-specific
 IgM
 antibody
 during
 the
 newborn
 period,
 have
 persistent
varicella-specific IgG immunity after age 1 year without 
a history of postnatal varicella, or demonstrate positive lymphocyte transformation in
response to VZV antigen 
(37).
 Congenital varicella syndrome was first recognized in 1947 
(40). Congenital varicella syndrome can occur among 
infants  born  to  mothers  infected  during  the  first  half  of  pregnancy  and  might  be
manifested by low birthweight, cutaneous 
scarring, limb hypoplasia, microcephaly, cortical atrophy, chorioretinitis, cataracts, and
other anomalies. In one study, incidence 
of congenital varicella syndrome was calculated using aggregate data from nine cohort
studies carried out during 
1986--2002 (47). Rates were 0.6% (4 of 725) for 2--12 weeks' gestation, 1.4% (9 of 642)
for 13--28 weeks, and 0 (0 of 385) after 
28 weeks.
 In a prospective study of 1,373 mothers with varicella during pregnancy conducted in
the United Kingdom and 
West  Germany  during  1980--1993,  the  highest  risk  (2%)  for  congenital  varicella
syndrome was observed when maternal 
infection occurred during 13--20 weeks' gestation 
(43). The risk was 0.4% after maternal infection during 0--12 weeks' gestation. 
No cases of congenital varicella syndrome occurred among the infants of 366 mothers
with HZ during pregnancy. Nine 
isolated  cases  involving  birth  defects  consistent  with  congenital  varicella  syndrome
have been reported after maternal varicella 
beyond 20 weeks' gestation (with the latest occurring at 28 weeks) 
(47,48). In a prospective study, HZ occurred 
during infancy or early childhood in four (0.8%) of 477 infants who were exposed to VZV
during 13--24 weeks' gestation and in six (1.7%) 
of 345 infants who were exposed during 25--36 weeks' gestation 
(43).
 The onset of varicella in pregnant women from 5 days 
before to 2 days after delivery results in severe varicella infection in 
an  estimated  17%--30%  of  their  newborn  infants.  These  infants  are  exposed  to  VZV
without sufficient maternal 
antibody  to  lessen  the  severity  of  disease.  The  risk  for  neonatal  death  has  been
estimated to be 31% among infants whose mothers 
had onset of rash <4 days before giving birth 
(45). This estimate was made on the basis of a limited number of infant deaths 
and  might  be  higher  than  the  actual  risk  because  the  study  was  performed  before
neonatal intensive care was available. In 
addition,  certain  cases  were  not  part  of  prospective  studies  but  were  reported
retrospectively, making the results subject to selection 
bias. When these cases were reevaluated subsequently by another investigator, certain
infants were demonstrated to have been at 
higher risk for death because of low birthweight; in at least one case, another cause of
death was probable 
(46). Varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) has been reported to reduce incidence of
severe neonatal varicella disease 
(49)  and  therefore  is  indicated  in  such  situations.  Nevertheless,  the  risk  for  death
among neonates who do not receive postexposure 
prophylaxis with VZIG is likely to be substantially lower than was estimated previously.
Herpes Zoster Surveillance
 After primary infection, VZV persists as a latent infection in sensory-nerve ganglia. The
virus can reactivate, causing 
HZ.  Mechanisms  controlling  VZV  latency  are  not  well  understood.  Risk  factors  for  HZ
include aging, immunosuppression, 
and  initial  infection  with  varicella  in  utero  or  during  early  childhood  (i.e.,  age  <18
months). An estimated 15%--30% of 
the general population experience HZ during their lifetimes 
(50,51); this proportion is likely to increase 
as life expectancy increases. The most common complication of HZ, particularly in older
persons, is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), 
the persistence of sometimes debilitating pain weeks to months after resolution of HZ. 
Life-threatening complications of HZ also can occur; these include herpes ophthalmicus,
which can lead to blindness. Another severe manifestation is 
dissemination,  which  might  involve  generalized  skin  eruptions,  and  central  nervous
system, pulmonary, hepatic, and 
pancreatic complications. Dissemination, pneumonia, and 
visceral involvement typically are restricted to immunocompromised 
persons.  VZV  can  be  transmitted  from  the  lesions  of  patients  who  have  HZ  to
susceptible contacts. Although few data are available 
to assess this risk, one household contact study reported 
that the risk for VZV transmission from HZ was approximately 
20% of the risk for transmission from varicella 
(52).
 Varicella vaccination might alter the risk for HZ at the level of both the individual and
the population (i.e., herd 
immunity). Just as wild-type VZV can cause wild-type HZ, attenuated vaccine virus has
the potential to become latent and later reactivate 
to cause vaccine virus strain (also called Oka-strain) HZ 
(53). Multiple studies have evaluated the risk for Oka-strain HZ 
after vaccination of immunocompromised or healthy children 
(54--58). In a study of leukemic children, the rate of HZ after a 
mean 4.1 years of follow-up (range: 6 months--10 years) was 2% in vaccine recipients
and 15% in controls with a history of 
varicella  (54).  A  subset  of  96  of  these  vaccine  recipients  was  matched  prospectively
according to chemotherapeutic protocol with 
96 leukemic children who had experienced natural varicella. Analysis indicated that the
incidence of HZ was 
approximately three times lower in vaccine recipients (0.80 per 100 person-years) than
in the matched leukemic children who had experienced 
natural varicella (2.46 per 100 person-years) (p = 0.01). Data for healthy children are
more limited, and findings might be influenced 
by multiple factors (e.g., incomplete ascertainment, limited duration of follow up or no
follow up of subjects of older ages, 
no comprehensive screening for wild-type varicella infection before or after vaccination,
or lack of testing all cases to distinguish 
Oka- from wild-type HZ). Nonetheless, these studies suggest that the risk for Oka-strain
HZ after a single dose of varicella vaccine 
is lower than that after wild-type varicella infection 
(56--58). Over time, the risk for and manifestation of Oka-strain HZ should 
be examined in older persons who are at greater risk for HZ complications. Persons who
experience varicella infection 
before  vaccination  (i.e.,  as  a  result  of  in  utero  or  unapparent  infection)  or  after
vaccination (i.e., as a result of breakthrough 
infection) presumably are latently infected with two strains of VZV. The risk for HZ in
these persons is unknown. No long-term 
studies have been conducted that compare the risk for Oka-strain HZ in persons who
receive 1 dose of varicella vaccine with the risk 
for those who receive 2 doses.
 Varicella vaccination also might change the risk for HZ at the population level. With the
development of herd 
immunity and reduction in the likelihood of exposure, the varicella vaccination program
prevents wild-type VZV infection 
among vaccine recipients and nonvaccine recipients, eliminating the risk for wild-type
HZ in these persons. Reduction in 
the likelihood of wild-type varicella infection also increases the 
median age for acquiring varicella (although age-specific 
incidence  rates  themselves  are  lower).  This  reduces  the  risk  for  varicella  infection
during early childhood (i.e., age <18 months), 
thereby reducing a risk factor for childhood HZ.
 Exposure  of  persons  with  latent  wild-type  VZV  infection  to  persons  with  varicella  is
thought to boost specific 
immunity,  which  might  contribute  to  controlling  reactivation  of  VZV  and  the
development of HZ 
(50).  Concern  has  been  expressed  that  by  providing  fewer  opportunities  for  varicella
exposure among persons with previous wild-type varicella 
infection, reduction in the likelihood of exposure might 
increase the risk for HZ, possibly within as few as 5 years after introduction of 
varicella vaccination (59) and reaching a vaccination 
coverage of >90%.
 Herpes  zoster  is  not  a  nationally  notifiable  disease  in  the  United  States,  and  HZ
surveillance has been conducted 
using multiple methods, study sites, or data sources. For certain studies, baseline data
were available before the start of the 
varicella  vaccination  program.  One  study  that  included  baseline  data  was  a
retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from 
a health maintenance organization (HMO) during 1992--2002 
(60). This HMO study indicated that age-adjusted incidence 
of HZ remained stable during 1992--2002 as incidence of 
varicella decreased (60). Age-adjusted and -specific 
annual incidence rates of HZ fluctuated slightly over time; the age-adjusted rate was
highest in 1992, at 4.1 cases per 1,000 
person-years,  and  was  3.7  cases  per  1,000  person-years  in  2002.  For  other  studies
initiated in the postvaccine era, baseline data are 
not  available  (61--63).  An  analysis  of  national  incidence  data  from  the  Medstat
database (available at 
http://www.medstat.com/Products/view/?id=71) demonstrated 
an overall incidence of HZ in 2000 and 2001 of 3.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 
= 3.1--3.2) per 1,000 person-years (61), representing no increase in age-adjusted HZ in
the past 20 years in the United 
States compared with earlier published data 
(64). Data from two HMOs in Oregon and Washington for 1997--2003 indicated 
no statistically significant increase in HZ incidence rates except among 
children aged 10--17 years (relative risk [RR] = 1.12, CI 
= 1.05--1.18); these increases were attributed to increased use of oral steroids 
(62).  Another  study  of  data  gathered  from  a  statewide  telephone  survey  during
1999--2003 in Massachusetts demonstrated an increase in HZ 
(63).  Age  groups  particularly  affected  included  persons  aged  25--44  years  and  those
aged >65 years. Finally, in the two active varicella surveillance 
sites  (Antelope  Valley,  California,  and  West  Philadelphia,  Pennsylvania),  active
surveillance for HZ in children aged <20 years 
has been ongoing since 2000. During 2000--2004, incidence of HZ in children aged <10
years declined significantly 
(p<0.05) from 0.75 to 0.23 cases per 1,000 children 
(65; CDC unpublished data, 2006). In summary, multiple studies and 
surveillance data demonstrate no consistent trends in HZ incidence in the United States
since implementation of the varicella 
vaccination program in 1995.
Use of Acyclovir to Treat and Prevent Varicella
 Acyclovir  is  a  synthetic  nucleoside  analog  that  inhibits  replication  of  human  herpes
viruses, including VZV. Since the 
early  1980s,  intravenous  acyclovir  has  been  available  to  treat  immunocompromised
persons who have varicella. 
When administered within 24 hours of onset of rash, acyclovir has been demonstrated
to be effective in reducing 
varicella-associated morbidity and mortality in this population 
(66--68).
 In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved the use of oral acyclovir for the treatment of varicella 
in
 otherwise
 healthy
 children.
 This
 approval
 was
 made
 on
 the
 basis
 of
placebo-controlled, double-blind studies 
(69,70) that demonstrated the beneficial clinical effects (i.e., a decrease in the number
of days in which new lesions appeared, the 
duration of fever, and the severity of cutaneous and systemic signs and symptoms) that
occurred when acyclovir was 
administered within 24 hours of rash onset. No serious adverse events occurred during
the period of drug 
administration. Administration of acyclovir did not decrease transmission of varicella or
reduce the duration of absence from school. Because few 
complications occurred (1%--2%), these studies could not determine whether acyclovir
had a statistically significant effect on disease 
severity  among  healthy  children.  In  these  studies,  antibody  titers  after  infection  in
children receiving acyclovir did not 
differ substantially from titers of children in the control group 
(69,70). Clinical trials among adolescents and adults have 
indicated that acyclovir is well-tolerated and effective in 
reducing the duration and severity of clinical illness if the drug is 
administered within 24 hours of rash onset 
(71--73).
 In 1993, AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases published a statement 
regarding the use of acyclovir (74). AAP did 
not  consider  administration  of  acyclovir  to  healthy  children  to  have  clinical  benefit
sufficient to justify its routine 
administration;  however,  AAP  stated  that  certain  circumstances  might  justify  its  use.
AAP recommended that oral acyclovir should 
be considered for otherwise healthy persons at increased risk for moderate to severe
varicella (e.g., persons aged >12 years, 
persons with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders, persons 
receiving long-term salicylate therapy, and persons receiving 
short,  intermittent,  or  aerosolized  courses  of  corticosteroids).  Certain  experts  also
recommend use of oral acyclovir 
for secondary case-patients who live in the same households as infected children 
(74).
 Acyclovir is classified as a Category B drug in the FDA 
use-in-pregnancy rating. Although studies involving animals 
have  not  indicated  teratogenic  effects,  adequate,  well-controlled  studies  in  pregnant
women have not been conducted. 
However, a prospective registry of acyclovir use during pregnancy that collected data
on outcomes of 596 infants whose mothers 
were  exposed  to  systemic  acyclovir  during  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  indicated
that the rate and types of birth 
defects 
approximated those in the general population 
(75). AAP has not recommended routine use of oral acyclovir for 
pregnant  women  because  the  risks  and  benefits  to  the  fetus  and  mother  were
unknown. However, in instances of serious, 
viral-mediated
 complications
 (e.g.,
 pneumonia),
 AAP
 has
 recommended
 that
intravenous acyclovir should be considered 
(74).
 Two  nucleoside  analogs,  acyclovir  and  famciclovir,  have  been  approved  by  FDA  for
treating HZ. If administered within 
72  hours  of  rash  onset,  acyclovir  has  accelerated  the  rate  of  cutaneous  healing  and
reduced the severity of acute pain in adults 
who have HZ (76). Oral famciclovir, when administered 
during the same period, has similar efficacy 
(77).
 Acyclovir is not indicated for prophylactic use among 
otherwise healthy children, adolescents, or adults without evidence 
of  immunity  after  exposure  to  varicella.  Vaccination  is  the  method  of  choice  in  these
situations. No studies have been 
conducted  regarding  prophylactic  use  of  acyclovir  among  immunocompromised
persons; therefore, VZIG is recommended in 
these situations.
Vaccines for Prevention of Varicella
 Two  live  attenuated  varicella  virus  vaccines  are  licensed  in  the  United  States  for
prevention of varicella: 
single-antigen varicella vaccine 
(VARIVAX,® Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) and combination MMRV
vaccine  (ProQuad,®  Merck  &  Co.,  Inc.,  Whitehouse,  New  Jersey).  Both  vaccines  are
derived from the Oka strain of live, 
attenuated VZV. The Oka strain was isolated in Japan 
(78) in the early 1970s from vesicular fluid in a healthy child who had 
natural  varicella  and  was  attenuated  through  sequential  propagation  in  cultures  of
human embryonic lung cells, 
embryonic guinea-pig cells, and human diploid cells (WI-38). The virus in the Oka/Merck
vaccine has undergone further passage through 
human diploid-cell cultures (MRC-5) for a total of 31 passages.
 In 1995, the single-antigen varicella vaccine was licensed in the United States for use
among healthy persons aged 
>12 months. This vaccine is lyophilized; when reconstituted as directed in the package
insert and stored at room temperature for 
a maximum of 30 minutes, it contains a minimum of 1,350 plaque forming units (PFUs)
of Oka/Merck VZV in each 0.5 
mL dose (79). Each dose also contains 12.5 mg of hydrolyzed gelatin, trace amounts of
neomycin and fetal bovine serum, 25 
mg  of  sucrose,  and  trace  residual  components  of  MRC-5  cells  (including  DNA  and
protein). The vaccine does 
not contain preservatives. Since 1995, >55 million doses have been distributed in the
United States. Reporting of serious 
adverse events has been rare (see Vaccine-Associated Adverse Events).
 In  2005,  the  combination  MMRV  vaccine  was  licensed  in  the  United  States  for  use
among healthy children aged 
12 months--12 years. The attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine viruses in 
ProQuad® are identical and of equal titer 
to those in the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, 
MMRII® (80). The titer of Oka/Merck VZV is higher in 
MMRV than in single-antigen varicella vaccine, a minimum of 3.99 
log10 PFUs compared with 1,350 PFUs (approximately 
3.13  log10)  in  each  0.5  mL  dose.  The  other  constituents  are  similar  to  those  in  the
single-antigen varicella vaccine.
Immune Response to Vaccination
 In  clinical  trials  of  the  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  conducted  before  licensure,
seroconversion was assessed using lots 
of vaccine with different amounts of PFUs and laboratory 
assays with different levels of sensitivity and specificity. Using 
a  specially  developed,  sensitive  gp-enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  test
that is not available 
commercially,  seroconversion  (defined  by  the  acquisition  of  any  detectable  varicella
antibodies >0.3 gpELISA units) was 
observed at approximately 4--6 weeks after vaccination with 
1 dose of varicella vaccine in approximately 97% of 6,889 
susceptible  children  aged  1--12  years  (79).  The  seroconversion  rate  was  98%  for
children aged 12--15 months and 95% among those 
aged 5--12 years (81). Adolescents aged 13--17 years had a lower seroconversion rate
(79%) after a single dose of vaccine. A 
study performed postlicensure used fluorescent antibody 
to membrane antigen (FAMA) titers 16 weeks after vaccination to 
assess serologic response and demonstrated that 61 (76%) of 80 healthy child vaccine
recipients seroconverted (FAMA titers 
>1:4) after 1 dose of single-antigen varicella 
vaccine (82).
 Primary antibody response to the vaccine at 6 weeks postvaccination is correlated with
protection against disease 
(83,84). In clinical trials, rates of breakthrough disease were lower among children with
varicella antibody titers of 
>5 gpELISA units than among those with titers of <5 units 
(84); children with a 6-week postvaccination antibody titer of <5 gpELISA units were 
3.5 times more likely to have breakthrough varicella than those with a titer of 
>5 gpELISA units. Later studies of 
immunogenicity 
(85)  have  reported  the  proportion  of  vaccinated  children  who  achieved  this  antibody
level 
instead of seroconversion. After 1 dose of the 
single-antigen varicella vaccine, 86% of children had gpELISA levels of 
>5 units/mL (85). Studies performed 
using FAMA indicated that a titer >1:4 at 16 weeks postvaccination is correlated with
protection against disease 
(82). Of healthy persons with a titer of >1:4 at 16 weeks post vaccination, <1% have
had varicella after a household exposure (n = 130). 
In contrast, the attack rate among those with a titer of <1:4 was 55% (n = 60).
 Persistence of antibody in children after 1 dose of single-antigen varicella vaccine was
demonstrated in both short- and 
long-term  follow-up  studies.  In  a  clinical  study,  the  rate  of  antibody  persistence
detected by gpELISA was nearly 100% after 9 
years  of  follow-up  for  277  children  (85).  Another  study  demonstrated  that  although
antibody titers (detected by FAMA) 
might  decline  12--24  months  after  vaccination,  the  median  titer  did  not  change  after
1--4 years and even rose after 10 years 
(86).  In  Japan,  VZV  antibodies  were  present  in  37  (97%)  of  38  children  who  received
varicella vaccine 7--10 years earlier (with 
titers comparable to those of 29 children who had had natural varicella infection within
the previous 10 years) 
(87) and in 100% of 25 children when followed for as long as 20 years (i.e., antibody
levels were higher than those observed 10 years earlier) 
(88).  Interpretation  of  long-term  studies  is  complicated  by  at  least  two  factors.  First,
asymptomatic boosting of 
vaccine-induced  immunity  by  exposure  to  wild-type  VZV  is  likely.  Because  varicella
vaccine is not routinely recommended in Japan, 
coverage of children was estimated to be low (approximately 20%) during 1991--1993.
Second, sample sizes were limited as a result 
of  the  decrease  in  the  number  of  children  followed-up  with  increasing  time  since
vaccination.
 The second dose of varicella vaccine in children produced an improved immunologic
response that is correlated 
with improved protection. A comparative study of healthy children who received 1 or 2
doses of single-antigen varicella 
vaccine  administered  3  months  apart  indicated  that  a  second  dose  provided  higher
antibody levels as measured by the proportion 
of subjects with titers of >5 gpELISA units and by 
geometric mean titers (GMTs) and higher efficacy 
(85; Tables 2--4). The proportion of subjects with antibody titers of 
>5 gpELISA units in the 2-dose recipients was higher 6 weeks after the 
second  dose  than  after  the  first  dose  (99.6%  and  85.7%,  respectively)  and  remained
high at the end of the 9-year follow-up 
period,  although  the  difference  between  the  two  regimens  narrowed  (97%  and  95%,
respectively). GMT 6 weeks after the 
second  dose  was  substantially  higher  than  that  after  a  single  dose  (142  and  12,
respectively). The difference in GMTs between the 
two  regimens  did  not  persist  over  9  years  of  follow-up  among  subjects  who
seroconverted after vaccination, although GMTs 
in both regimens remained high by the end of the study period. However, receipt of a
second dose decreased the rate 
of  breakthrough  varicella  significantly  (3.3-fold)  and  increased  vaccine  efficacy
(p<0.001). Another study that assessed 
the  immunogenicity  of  a  second  dose  received  4--6  years  after  the  first  dose
demonstrated a substantial increase in antibody 
levels in the first 7--10 days in the majority of those tested, indicating an anamnestic
response. On the day of the second dose, 
GMT  was  25.7,  compared  with  143.6  GMT  7--10  days  after  the  second  dose;  60%  of
recipients had at least a fourfold increase 
in antibody titers, and an additional 17% had at least a twofold increase 
(89). Three months after the second dose, 
GMT remained higher than on the day of second dose (119.0 and 25.7, respectively).
Among children, VZV antibody levels 
and GMTs after 2 doses administered 4--6 years apart were comparable to those 
obtained when the 2 doses were administered 3 months apart.
 The  combination  MMRV  vaccine  was  licensed  on  the  basis  of  noninferiority  of
immunogenicity of the 
antigenic  components  compared  with  MMR  and  varicella  vaccines  administered
concomitantly at separate inspection sites rather 
than  on  clinical  efficacy  (80).  Clinical  studies  of  healthy  children  aged  12--23  months
indicated that those who received 1 dose 
of  MMRV  vaccine  had  levels  of  antibody  to  measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella
similar to levels of children who received 
1  dose  of  MMR  and  1  dose  of  varicella  vaccines  concomitantly  at  separate  injection
sites. For the varicella component 
in MMRV, 91.2% (CI = 87.0%--94.4%) of children achieved antibody titers of 
>5 gpELISA units/mL 6 weeks after 
vaccination  (90).  A  subgroup  of  children  received  a  second  dose  of  MMRV  vaccine
approximately 3 months after the first dose. 
The  serologic  response  (>5  gpELISA  units/mL)  after  2  doses  was  99.2%  (CI  =
97.0%--99.9%) (Table 2). Also, GMT for 
varicella after the second dose of MMRV vaccine increased approximately 
forty-onefold (90). Administration of combination 
MMRV vaccine to healthy children aged 4--6 years who had been vaccinated previously
with MMR and single-antigen 
varicella vaccines resulted in similar antibody levels and a 
twenty-fivefold increase in GMT levels (91).
 Among persons aged >13 years, multiple studies have 
described seroconversion rates after receipt of the 
single-antigen varicella vaccine (range: 72%--94% after 1 dose and 94%--99% after a
second dose administered 4--8 weeks 
later)  (79,92,93).  In  clinical  studies,  detectable  antibody  levels  have  persisted  for  at
least 5 years in 97% of adolescents and 
adults who were administered 2 doses of vaccine 4--8 weeks apart 
(79). However, other studies demonstrated that 25%--31% 
of 
adult  vaccine  recipients  who  seroconverted  lost  detectable  antibodies  (by  FAMA)  at
multiple intervals (range: 1--11 
years)  after  vaccination  (93,94).  For  persons  who  had  breakthrough  disease  after
exposure to varicella, the severity of illness or 
the attack rates did not increase over time 
(95).
 Innate  (i.e.,  nonspecific)  and  adaptive  (i.e.,  humoral  and  cellular)  immunity  are
important in the control of primary 
varicella  infection.  The  capacity  to  elicit  cell-mediated  immunity  is  important  for  viral
clearance, providing 
long-term  protection  against  disease  and  preventing  symptomatic  VZV  reactivation.
Studies among children and adults have 
indicated that breakthrough varicella typically is mild, even among vaccine recipients
without seroconversion or vaccine recipients 
who lost detectable antibody, suggesting that VZV-specific 
cell-mediated immunity affords protection to vaccine recipients in 
the absence of a detectable antibody response 
(94,95). Studies of the cellular immune response to vaccination among 
children demonstrated that immunization with 1 
dose of varicella vaccine induced VZV-specific T-cell proliferation that 
was maintained in 26 (90%) of 29 children 1 year postvaccination and in 52 (87%) of 60
children 5 years postvaccination 
(96). In this study, the mean stimulation index (SI), a marker of cell-mediated immunity,
was 12.1 after 
1 year and 22.1 after 5 years. Data obtained at 1 year postvaccination from a subset of
children in a prelicensure study comparing the immune 
response  among  children  who  received  1  and  2  doses  administered  3  months  apart
demonstrated that the 
varicella-specific  lymphocyte  proliferation  responses  were  significantly  higher  for
recipients of 2 doses than for recipients of 1 dose (mean SI: 34.7 and 
23.1, respectively; p = 0.03) (97). In the study of the 2 doses administered 4--6 years
apart, results also indicated that 
the lymphocyte proliferation response was significantly higher at 6 weeks and 3 months
after the second dose than at the 
same time points after the first dose (p<0.01) 
(89; Table 2).
 Among adults, vaccine-induced VZV-specific T-cell proliferation was maintained in 16
(94%) of 17 subjects 1 and 5 
years postvaccination (96,98). The mean SI was 9.9 after 1 year and 22.4 after 5 years.
 
Correlates of Protection 
 For  children,  the  varicella  antibody  response  measured  by  gpELISA  6  weeks
postvaccination correlates with 
neutralizing antibody level, VZV-specific T-cell proliferative responses, vaccine efficacy,
and long-term protection against varicella 
after exposure to VZV (83,84,99,100). A titer of 
>5 gpELISA units/mL is associated with protection against disease although 
it  should  not  be  considered  an  absolute  guarantee  of  protection.  Breakthrough  cases
have occurred among children with 
>5 gpELISA units/mL. A FAMA titer 
>1:4 at 16 weeks post-vaccination also correlates with protection against disease 
(82).  However,  neither  of  these  antibody  tests  is  available  commercially.  The
relationship between the antibody level measured 
at other intervals postvaccination, especially immediately prior to 
exposure and breakthrough disease has not been studied. 
No correlates of protection have been evaluated for adults.
Vaccine Efficacy and Vaccine Effectiveness
One-Dose Regimen
 
Prelicensure Efficacy
 In prelicensure studies carried out among children aged 
12 months--14 years, the protective efficacy of 
single-antigen varicella vaccine varied, depending on the amount of live 
virus administered per dose, the exposure setting (community 
or household), and the quality and length of the clinical follow-up. The majority of the
prelicensure studies reported efficacy of 
1 dose of varicella vaccine within the range of 70%--90% against any clinical disease
and 95% against severe disease for 
7--10  years  after  vaccination  (81,101,102).  A  randomized  placebo-controlled  efficacy
trial was conducted among children aged 
12  months--14  years,  but  the  formulation  differed  from  that  of  the  current  vaccine
(17,000 PFUs per dose 
(103,104), with follow-up of children through 7 years postvaccination 
(105). Reported efficacy was 100% at 1 year and 98% at 2 years 
after  vaccination,  and  100%  and  92%,  respectively,  after  exposures  to  VZV  that
occurred in the household. Although a 
randomized control study was not conducted for adults, the efficacy of single-antigen
varicella vaccine was 
determined by evaluation of protection when adult vaccine recipients were exposed to
varicella in the household. On the basis of the reported 
historical 
attack rate of 87% for natural varicella after household exposure among unvaccinated
children, estimated efficacy 
among  adults  was  approximately  80%  (79).  The  attack  rate  of  unvaccinated  adults
exposed in households was not studied.
 
Postlicensure Efficacy and Effectiveness
 Prevention of All Varicella Disease
 Postlicensure studies have assessed the 
effectiveness¶ of the single-antigen varicella vaccine under field conditions in 
child  care,  school,  household,  and  community  settings  using  multiple  methods.
Effectiveness frequently has been estimated 
against all varicella and also against moderate and severe varicella (defined in different
ways). Outbreak investigations 
have assessed effectiveness against clinically defined varicella. The majority of these
investigations have demonstrated 
vaccine effectiveness for prevention of varicella in the same range 
described in prelicensure trials (70%--90%) 
(3--6,106--113), with some lower (44%, 56%) 
(114,115) and some higher (100% in one of two schools investigated) estimates 
(107).  A  retrospective  cohort  study  in  11  childcare  centers  demonstrated  vaccine
effectiveness of 83% for prevention of 
clinically  diagnosed  varicella  (116).  In  a  case-control  study  that  measured  vaccine
effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed varicella 
in  a  pediatric  office  setting  during  1997--2003,  vaccine  effectiveness  was  85%  (CI  =
78%--90%) during the first four years 
and 87% (CI = 81%--91%) for the entire study period 
(117,118). Finally, in a study of household secondary attack 
rates, considered the most robust test of vaccine performance because of the intensity
of exposure, varicella vaccine was 79% (CI 
= 70%--85%) effective in preventing clinically defined varicella in exposed household
contacts aged 12 months--14 
years without a history of varicella disease or vaccination 
(119). Postlicensure data on vaccine effectiveness against all disease 
have been summarized (Table 5).
 In a randomized clinical trial conducted postlicensure that compared the efficacy of 1
dose of varicella vaccine with that of 
2 doses, the estimated vaccine efficacy for 1 dose for a 
10-year observation period was 94.4% (CI = 92.9%--95.7%) 
(85;  Table  3).  In  the  same  study,  the  efficacy  of  1  dose  of  vaccine  in  preventing
varicella after household exposure for 10 years was 
90.2% (CI = 83.7%--96.7%) (Table 4). This study did not use placebo controls and used
historic data for attack rates 
in unvaccinated children to calculate vaccine 
efficacy. 
 Prevention of Moderate and Severe Varicella
 Postlicensure studies assessing vaccine performance in 
preventing moderate and severe varicella have 
consistently demonstrated high effectiveness. Definitions for disease 
severity have varied among studies. Certain studies have used 
a defined scale of illness that included the number of skin 
lesions, fever, complications, and investigator assessment of 
illness severity, and others have used only the number of skin 
lesions, reported complications, or hospitalizations. 
Moderate varicella typically has been defined as either 50--500 or 250--500 lesions, and
severe varicella has been defined as >500 lesions or 
any hospitalization or complication. In the randomized postlicensure clinical trial, severe
varicella was defined as >300 lesions 
and fever of >102°F (38.9°C), oral equivalent. 
Regardless of different definitions, multiple studies have 
demonstrated that single-antigen varicella vaccine was>>95% effective in preventing
combined moderate and severe disease 
(3--6,85,106,107,109--113,115--119); one study demonstrated effectiveness of 86% 
(114). Effectiveness was 100% against severe disease 
when measured separately 
(6,85,109,111,117,119). Postlicensure data on vaccine effectiveness against moderate
and severe 
varicella have been summarized (Table 5).
Two-Dose Regimen
 In  a  randomized  clinical  trial  of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  that  compared  the
efficacy of 1 dose with that of 2 
doses  administered  3  months  apart,  the  estimated  vaccine  efficacy  of  2  doses  for  a
10-year observation period was 98.3% (CI 
= 97.3%--99.0%), which was significantly higher than efficacy after 1 dose (p<0.001) 
(85; Table 5). The 2-dose regimen also was 100% efficacious against severe varicella. In
the same study, the efficacy of 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine 
in  preventing  disease  after  household  exposure  over  10  years  was  96.4%  (CI  =
92.4%--100%), not significantly different from 
1  dose  (90.2%)  (p  =  0.112)  (Table  4).  However,  the  number  of  cases  involving
household exposure was limited.
 Formal studies to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the combination MMRV vaccine have
not been performed. Efficacy of 
the  individual  components  was  established  previously  in  clinical  studies  with  the
single-antigen vaccines.
Breakthrough Disease
 Breakthrough  disease  is  defined  as  a  case  of  infection  with  wild-type  VZV  occurring
>42 days after vaccination. In 
clinical trials, varicella disease was substantially less severe among vaccinated persons
than among unvaccinated persons, who 
usually have fever and several hundred vesicular lesions 
(120). In cases of breakthrough disease, the median number of skin lesions 
is commonly <50 (99,121--123). In addition, 
compared with unvaccinated persons, vaccine recipients have had fewer 
vesicular  lesions  (lesions  more  commonly  are  atypical,  with  papules  that  do  not
progress to vesicles), shorter 
duration of illness, and lower incidence of fever.
 Multiple  postlicensure  investigations  also  have  demonstrated  that  the  majority  of
breakthrough varicella cases 
are significantly milder than cases among unvaccinated children (p<0.05) 
(3,5,107--114,116--118,124). However, 
approximately  25%--30%  of  breakthrough  cases  are  not  mild,  with  clinical  features
more similar to those in unvaccinated children 
(124). Since 1999, when varicella deaths became nationally notifiable, two deaths from
breakthrough varicella disease have 
been  reported  to  CDC;  one  of  a  girl  aged  9  years  with  a  history  of  asthma  who  was
receiving steroids when she had 
the  breakthrough  infection,  and  the  other  of  a  girl  aged  7  years  with  a  history  of
malignant ependymoma who also was 
under steroid therapy at the time of her death (CDC, unpublished data, 2006).
 
One-Dose Regimen
 In clinical trials, 1,114 children aged 1--12 years received 
1 dose of single-antigen varicella vaccine containing 
2,900--9,000 PFUs of attenuated virus per dose and were actively followed for up to 10
years postvaccination 
(79).  Among  a  subset  of  95  vaccine  recipients  with  household  exposure  to  varicella,
eight (8%) reported a mild form of varicella (10--34 lesions).
 In a randomized clinical trial that compared the efficacy of 1 dose of vaccine to that of
2 doses during a 10-year 
observation period, the cumulative rate of breakthrough varicella among children who
received 1 dose was 7.3% 
(85).  Breakthrough  cases  occurred  annually  in  0.2%--2.3%  of  recipients  of  1  dose  of
vaccine. Cases occurred throughout the observation period, 
but the majority were reported 2--5 years after vaccination (Figure 4). Of 57 children
with breakthrough cases, 13 (23%) had 
>50 lesions.
 In  cross-sectional  studies,  the  attack  rate  for  breakthrough  disease  has  ranged
between 11% and 17% (and as high as 40% 
in certain classrooms) in outbreak investigations 
(3) and 15% in household settings 
(119).
Two-Dose Regimen
 
Data Among Children
 In a randomized clinical trial that compared the efficacy of 1 dose of vaccine with that
of 2 doses, the cumulative rate 
of breakthrough varicella during a 10-year observation period was 3.3-fold lower among
children who received 2 doses than 
that among children who received 1 dose (2.2% and 7.3, 
respectively; p<0.001) (85). Breakthrough cases occurred 
occasionally in 0.8% of 2-dose vaccine recipients. The 
majority of cases of breakthrough disease occurred 2--5 years after vaccination; no 
cases  were  reported  7--10  years  after  vaccination  (Figure  4).  Of  16  children  with
breakthrough cases, three (19%) had >50 
lesions. The proportion of children with >50 lesions did not differ between the 1-dose
and 2-dose 
regimens (p = 0.5).
 
Breakthrough Infections Among Adolescents and Adults
 In postlicensure studies of adolescents and adults who 
received 2 doses, 40 (9%) cases of breakthrough 
varicella occurred among 461 vaccine recipients who were followed for 8 weeks--11.8
years (mean: 3.3 years) after vaccination 
(95), and 12 (10%) cases occurred among 120 vaccine recipients who were followed for
1 month--20.6 years (mean: 4.6 
years) (94). One prelicensure study of persons who had 
received 2 doses of vaccine reported that 12 (8%) breakthrough cases 
had occurred among 152 vaccine recipients who were followed for 5--66 months (mean:
30 months) postvaccination 
(93).
Contagiousness
 Prelicensure  clinical  trials  reported  the  rate  of  disease  transmission  from  vaccinated
persons with varicella cases to 
their  vaccinated  siblings.  In  10  trials  that  were  conducted  during  1981--1989,
breakthrough infections occurred in 114 (5.3%) 
of 2,163 vaccinated children during the 1--8 year follow-up period of active surveillance,
and secondary transmission occurred 
to 11 (12.2%) of their 90 vaccinated siblings 
(121). Illness was mild in both index and secondary case-patients. 
Household 
transmission from a vaccinated child with breakthrough disease to a susceptible adult
(one of whom died) have been 
reported (CDC, unpublished data, 2006). One study examined secondary attack rates
from vaccinated and unvaccinated persons 
with  varicella  to  both  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  households  contacts  aged  12
months--14 years 
(119). This study demonstrated that vaccinated persons with varicella with <50 lesions
were only one third as contagious as unvaccinated persons 
with varicella. However, vaccinated persons with varicella who had 
>50 lesions were as contagious as unvaccinated persons 
with varicella (119). Vaccinated persons with varicella tend to have milder disease, and,
although they are less contagious 
than  unvaccinated  persons  with  varicella,  they  might  not  receive  a  diagnosis  and  be
isolated. As a result, they might have 
more opportunities to infect others in community settings, thereby further contributing
to VZV transmission. Vaccinated 
persons with varicella also have been index case-patients in varicella outbreaks 
(3,4,115).
Risk Factors for Vaccine Failure
 Potential  risk  factors  for  vaccine  failure  have  been  identified  in  studies  of  vaccine
effectiveness during outbreak 
investigations and other specially designed studies 
(5,108--110,113--115,118,125). In outbreak investigations, the low number of 
cases limits the ability of researchers to conduct multivariate analyses and examine the
independent effect of each risk factor 
for  vaccine  failure.  An  increased  risk  for  breakthrough  disease  has  been  noted  with
decreasing age at vaccination, with a 
threefold  increase  in  breakthrough  disease  risk  for  children  vaccinated  at  age  <14
months 
(110), an increase of twofold in one study 
and nearly fourfold in another for children vaccinated at age <16 months 
(108,115), and a ninefold increase for 
children vaccinated at age <19 months 
(113). Other outbreak investigations have demonstrated that time since vaccination 
(variably defined as >3, >5, or 
>5 years) was associated with an increased risk for breakthrough disease (relative risk
[RR] = 2.6, 6.7, 
and  2.6,  respectively)  (5,114,115).  However,  age  at  vaccination  and  time  since
vaccination are highly correlated, and 
their independent association with the risk for breakthrough disease has been assessed
in only one outbreak investigation 
(113).  A  retrospective  cohort  study  that  adjusted  for  other  potential  risk  factors
demonstrated an increased risk for breakthrough 
disease for children vaccinated at age <15 months (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 1.4;
CI = 1.1%--1.9%) 
(125). A case-control study demonstrated that the effectiveness of vaccine in the first
year after vaccination was significantly lower (73%) among 
children vaccinated at age <15 months than it was among children vaccinated at age 
>15 months (99%) (p = 0.01) (118). However, 
the difference in the overall effectiveness between children vaccinated at these ages
was not statistically significant for 
subsequent years (8 years of follow-up) (81% and 88%, respectively; p = 0.17). Active
surveillance data collected during 1995--2004 
from a sentinel population of 350,000 persons were analyzed to 
determine whether the severity and annual incidence 
of breakthrough varicella cases increased with time since vaccination 
(126). Children vaccinated >5 years previously were 
2.6 times more likely to have moderate and severe breakthrough 
varicella than those vaccinated <5 years previously (p = 
0.016). The annual rates of breakthrough varicella among children aged 12 months--12
years increased significantly with time 
since vaccination after adjusting for the effects of age at infection, age at vaccination,
and year of infection (p<0.01).
 Multiple other studies that examined possible reasons for lower vaccine effectiveness
did not find age at vaccination 
(3--5,111,114) or time since vaccination 
(3,110,111) to be associated with vaccine failure. An ongoing study is examining 
these factors and risk for vaccine failure 
(127). After 8 years of active follow-up of 7,449 children vaccinated at age 12--23 
months,  results  do  not  indicate  an  increased  risk  for  breakthrough  disease  among
children vaccinated at age 12--14 months 
compared  with  those  vaccinated  at  age  15--23  months.  Moreover,  a  test  for  trend
revealed no change in the rate of 
reported breakthrough disease for each additional month of age at vaccination 
(127).
 Two  outbreak  investigations  noted  an  increased  risk  for  breakthrough  disease  in
children with asthma and 
eczema  (109,113).  In  these  investigations,  the  use  of  steroids  to  treat  asthma  or
eczema was not studied. Steroids have been 
associated previously with severe varicella in unvaccinated persons 
(128--130). Only one retrospective cohort study 
controlled  simultaneously  for  the  effect  of  multiple  risk  factors,  including  the  use  of
steroids, and this study demonstrated no 
association of risk for breakthrough disease with asthma or eczema 
(125). However, this study documented an increased risk 
for  breakthrough  disease  if  the  child  had  received  a  prescription  of  oral  steroids
(considered a proxy for taking oral steroids 
when exposed to varicella) within 3 months of breakthrough disease (adjusted RR [aRR]
= 2.4; CI = 1.3%--4.4%) and 
when varicella vaccination was administered within 28 days of MMR vaccine (aRR = 3.1;
CI = 1.5%--6.4%).
Evidence of Immunity
 ACIP has approved criteria for evidence of immunity to varicella (Box). Only doses of
varicella vaccines for which 
written documentation of the date of administration is presented should be considered
valid. Neither a self-reported dose nor a 
history of vaccination provided by a parent is, by itself, considered adequate evidence
of immunity. Persons who lack 
documentation of adequate vaccination or other evidence of 
immunity should be vaccinated.
 Historically, self-reporting of varicella disease by adults or by parents for their children
has been considered valid evidence 
of  immunity.  The  predictive  value  of  a  self-reported  positive  disease  history  was
extremely high in adults in the prevaccine 
era although data on positive predictive value are lacking in parental reports regarding
their children 
(131--133).  As  disease  incidence  decreases  and  the  proportion  of  vaccinated  persons
with varicella having mild cases increases, varicella will be 
less  readily  recognized  clinically.  A  recent  study  demonstrated  that  only  75%  of
unvaccinated children aged 12 
months--4 years who reported a positive history of 
varicella were in fact immune (confirmed by serological testing), compared with 89% 
of children aged 5--9 years and 10--14 years 
(134). To limit the number of false-positive 
reports and ensure immunity, ACIP recommends that evidence of immunity should be
either a diagnosis of varicella by a health-care provider or a 
health-care provider verification of a history of disease rather than parental or 
self-reporting. The above-cited study demonstrated 
that 99% of persons aged 15--19 years and 100% of those aged 20--29 years who 
reported a history of varicella were immune 
(134). Because serologic evidence of VZV infection 
has been documented in 96%--97% of U.S.-born adults aged 20--29 
years and in 97%--99% of adults aged >30 years tested during 1998--1999 
(12), U.S. birth before 1980 is considered evidence 
of  immunity  except  for  health-care  personnel  (HCP),  pregnant  women,  and
immunocomprised persons. For these three 
groups,  certainty  regarding  immunity  is  desirable  because  of  the  possibility  of
nosocomial transmission to 
high-risk  patients;  transmission  of  the  virus  to  the  fetus,  which  might  result  in
congenital 
varicella  syndrome;  and  the  possibility  of  severe  disease.  Postvaccination  serologic
testing to verify an immune response to varicella vaccine is not 
routinely  recommended  because  available  commercial  assays  lack  sensitivity  in
detecting vaccine-induced immunity and might give 
false negative results.
Simultaneous Administration of Vaccines
 Single-antigen varicella vaccine is well-tolerated and effective in healthy children aged 
>12  months  when  administered  simultaneously  with  MMR  vaccine  either  at  separate
sites and with separate syringes or separately 
>4  weeks  apart.  The  number  and  types  of  adverse  events  occurring  in  children  who
have received VARIVAX and MMRII concurrently have not 
differed from those in children who have been administered the vaccines at different
visits 
(79,135).  Data  concerning  the  effect  of  simultaneous  administration  of  VARIVAX  with
vaccines containing various combinations of MMR, diphtheria and 
tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP), and Haemophilus 
influenzae type b (Hib) have not been published 
(79).  A  randomized  study  of  694  subjects  determined  that  the  immune  response  to
MMR, varicella, and Hib vaccines administered concurrently with 
a fourth dose of pneumococal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was not inferior to that of those
vaccines when administered 
without PCV7; the percentage of subjects who seroconverted was >90% for all antigens
for both groups 
(136).
 Concomitant administration of the combination MMRV vaccine with other vaccines also
has been assessed. In a 
clinical  trial  involving  1,913  healthy  children  aged  12--15  months,  three  groups  were
compared 
(137).  One  group  received  concomitantly  administered  (at  separate  sites)  MMRV
vaccine, Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular 
Pertussis Vaccine Absorbed (DTaP), Hib conjugate (meningococcal 
protein conjugate) vaccine, and hepatitis B (recombinant) (Hep 
B)  vaccine.  The  second  group  received  MMRV  vaccine  at  the  initial  visit,  followed  by
DTaP, Hib, and Hep B 
vaccines administered concomitantly 6 weeks later. The third group received MMR and
varicella vaccines concomitantly followed 
6  weeks  later  by  DTaP,  Hib,  and  Hep  B  vaccines.  Seroconversion  rates  and  antibody
titers were comparable for the 
measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella  components  for  the  first  two  groups.  No
immunologic data were reported for 
the  third  group.  The  Hib  and  Hep  B  seroconversion  rates  for  the  two  groups  that
received those vaccines also were comparable.
 Data are absent or limited for the concomitant use of MMRV vaccine with inactivated
polio, pneumococal 
conjugate,  influenza,  and  hepatitis  A  vaccines.  Simultaneous  administration  of  the
majority of widely used live and inactivated 
vaccines has produced seroconversion rates and rates of adverse reactions similar to
those observed when the vaccines 
are administered separately. Therefore, single-antigen and combination MMRV vaccines
may be administered simultaneously 
with other vaccines recommended for children aged 12--15 months and those aged 4--6
years. Simultaneous administration 
is 
particularly important when health-care providers anticipate 
that, because of certain factors (e.g., previously 
missed vaccination opportunities), a child might not return for subsequent vaccination.
Economic Analysis of Vaccination
 A  cost-effectiveness  analysis  was  performed  before  initiation  of  the  varicella
vaccination program in the United States 
(138).  The  results  of  the  study  indicated  a  savings  of  $5.40  for  each  dollar  spent  on
routine vaccination of preschool-aged 
children when direct and indirect costs were considered. When only direct medical costs
were considered, the benefit-cost ratio 
was  0.9:1.0.  Benefit-cost  ratios  were  only  slightly  lower  when  lower  estimates  of  the
short- and long-term effectiveness of 
the vaccine were used.
 A  recent  analysis  was  performed  that  used  current  estimates  of  morbidity  and
mortality 
(20,28,33) and current direct and indirect costs (ACIP, unpublished presentation, 2006).
The model considered that the second dose will reduce varicella 
disease residual after the first dose by 79%. From a societal perspective, both 1-dose
and 2-dose vaccination programs are cost 
saving compared with no program. The vaccine program cost was estimated at $320
million for 1 dose and $538 million for 2 
doses. The savings from varicella disease prevented were estimated at approximately
$1.3 billion for the 1-dose program 
and  approximately  $1.4  billion  for  the  2-dose  program.  Compared  with  the  1-dose
program, the incremental cost for the 
second dose was estimated to be $96,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. If
benefits from preventing group 
A streptococcus infections and HZ among vaccinated persons are added, incremental
costs per QALY saved are $91,000 
and $17,000, respectively. Because of the uncertainty of the modeled predictions of an
increase in HZ among persons with 
a history of varicella and the fact that no consistent trends 
demonstrate an increase in HZ attributable to the 
varicella vaccination program in the United States, HZ among persons with a history of
varicella was not included in the model.
Storage, Handling, and Transportation of Varicella Vaccines
 Single-antigen varicella and combination MMRV vaccines have similar but not identical
distribution, handling, and 
storage  requirements  (79,80).  For  potency  to  be  maintained,  the  lyophilized  varicella
vaccines must be stored frozen at an 
average temperature of 5°F (-15°C) or colder. Household freezers manufactured since
the mid-1980s are designed to 
maintain  temperatures  from  -4°F  (-20°C)  to  5°F  (-15°C).  When  tested,  VARIVAX  has
remained stable in frost-free freezers. 
Freezers that reliably maintain an average temperature of <5°F (<-15°C) and that have
a separate sealed freezer door are acceptable 
for storing VARIVAX and ProQuad. Health-care providers may use stand-alone freezers
or the freezer compartment 
of refrigerator-freezer combinations, provided that the freezer compartment has its own
separate, sealed, and insulated 
exterior  door.  Units  with  an  internal  freezer  door  are  not  acceptable.  Temperatures
should be documented at the beginning and end 
of each day. Providers should document the required temperature in a newly purchased
unit for a minimum of 1 week 
before  using  it  to  store  vaccine  and  routinely  thereafter.  When  varicella  vaccines  are
stored in the freezer compartment of a 
combined  refrigerator-freezer,  temperatures  in  both  compartments  should  be
monitored carefully. Setting the thermostat low enough 
for  storage  of  varicella-containing  vaccines  might  inadvertently  expose  refrigerated
vaccines to freezing temperatures. 
Refrigerators with ice compartments that either are not tightly enclosed or are enclosed
with unsealed, uninsulated doors (e.g., 
small, dormitory-style refrigerators) are not acceptable 
for the storage of varicella vaccines.
 Diluent should be stored separately either at room temperature or in the refrigerator.
Vaccines should be 
reconstituted according to the directions in the package insert and only with the diluent
supplied with the vaccine, which does not 
contain  preservative  or  other  antiviral  substances  that  could  inactivate  the  vaccine
virus. Once reconstituted, vaccine should be 
used immediately to minimize loss of potency. Vaccine should be discarded if not used
within 30 minutes after reconstitution.
Handling and Transportation of Varicella Vaccines Within Off-Site Clinics
 When an immunization session is being held at a site distant from the freezer in which
the vaccine is stored, the number 
of  vaccine  vials  needed  for  the  immunization  session  should  be  packed  in  either  a
vaccine shipping container (as received 
from the manufacturer) or in an insulated cooler, with an 
adequate quantity of dry ice (i.e., a minimum of 6 lbs per box) to 
preserve  potency.  When  placed  in  a  suitable  container,  dry  ice  will  maintain  a
temperature of 
<5°F (<-15°C). Dry ice should remain 
in 
the container upon arrival at the clinic site. If no dry ice remains when the container is
opened at the receiving site, 
the  manufacturer  (Merck  and  Company,  Inc.)  should  be  contacted  for  guidance
(telephone: 1-800-982-7482). If dry ice 
is  available  at  the  receiving  site,  it  may  be  used  to  store  vaccine.  Thermometers  or
temperature indicators cannot be used in 
a container with dry ice. Diluent should not be transported on dry ice.
 If  dry  ice  is  not  available,  only  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  may  be  transported,
with frozen packs to keep 
the  temperatures  between  36°F--46°F  (2°C--8°C).  Transport  temperatures  should  be
monitored, and a temperature indicator 
or thermometer should be placed in the container and checked on arrival. The container
should be kept closed as much 
as  possible  during  the  immunization  session;  temperatures  should  be  checked  and
recorded hourly. If the temperature 
remains  between  36°F--46°F  (2°C--8°C),  the  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  may  be
used for up to 72 hours after its removal from 
the  freezer.  The  date  and  time  should  be  marked  on  the  vaccine  vial.  Single-antigen
varicella vaccine stored at 
refrigerated temperatures for any period of time may not be refrozen for future use.
 Transportation  and  storage  of  combination  MMRV  vaccine  at  temperatures  between
36°F--46°F (2°C--8°C) is not 
permissible  for  any  length  of  time.  In  contrast  to  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine,
combination MMRV vaccine must be maintained 
at temperatures of <5°F 
(<-15°C) until the time of reconstitution and administration. This difference in vaccine 
storage  temperatures  must  be  considered  when  planning  off-site  clinics.  For  this
reason, transportation of MMRV vaccine to 
off-site  clinics  is  not  advised.  If  any  concerns  arise  regarding  the  storage  of
single-antigen varicella or combination MMRV vaccines, 
the manufacturer should be contacted for guidance.
Minimizing Wastage of Vaccine 
 Vaccine  wastage  can  be  minimized  by  accurately  determining  the  number  of  doses
needed for a given patient population. 
To ensure maximal vaccine potency, smaller shipments of vaccine should be ordered
more frequently (preferably at least 
once  every  3  months).  Single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  should  not  be  distributed  to
providers who do not have the capacity to 
store it properly in a freezer until it is used. Transportation of varicella vaccine should
be kept to a minimum to prevent loss 
of potency. Off-site clinic sites should receive only such amounts of vaccine as they can
use within a short time (72 hours 
if storing single-antigen varicella vaccine at refrigerated temperatures).
Adverse Events After Vaccination
 Because  adverse  events  after  vaccination  might  continue  to  be  caused  by  wild-type
VZV even as varicella disease 
declines, health-care providers should obtain event-appropriate clinical specimens (e.g.,
cerebrospinal fluid for encephalitis, 
bronchial  lavage  or  lung  biopsy  for  pneumonia)  for  laboratory  evaluation,  including
strain identification. Information regarding 
strain  identification  is  available  from  Merck's  VZV  Identification  Program  (telephone:
1-800-652-6372) or from CDC's 
National
 Varicella

vzvlab@cdc.gov) or at 
http://www.cdc.gov/nip/diseases/varicella/surv/default.htm. Commercial 
laboratories do not have the capability for strain identification.
 The  National  Vaccine  Injury  Act  of  1986  requires  physicians  and  other  health-care
providers who administer vaccines 
to  maintain  permanent  immunization  records  and  to  report  occurrences  of  adverse
events for selected vaccines, 
including varicella vaccines. Serious adverse events (i.e., all events 
requiring medical attention) suspected to have been caused by 
varicella vaccines should be reported to the Vaccine 
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Forms and instructions are available 
at https://secure.vaers.org/vaersDataEntryintro.htm, in the FDA Drug Bulletin at 
http://www.fda.gov/medwatch,  or  from  the  24-hour  VAERS  information  recording  at
1-800 822-7967.
Prelicensure
 
Single-Antigen Varicella Vaccine 
 Single-antigen varicella vaccine was well-tolerated when 
administered to >11,000 healthy children, adolescents, and 
adults during prelicensure clinical trials. In a double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study among 914 susceptible healthy children aged 
12 months--14 years, the only statistically significant (p<0.05) adverse events reported
that were more common among 
vaccine  recipients  than  among  placebo  recipients  were  pain  and  redness  at  the
injection site 
(103). This study also described the presence of 
unspecific rash among 2% of placebo and 4% of vaccine 
recipients occurring within 43 days of vaccination. 
Of 
the  28  reported  rashes,  10  (36%)  were  examined  by  a  physician;  among  those  that
were examined, four of the 
seven  noninjection  site  rashes  in  vaccine  recipients  were  judged  to  be  varicella-like,
compared with none of the rashes in the 
placebo recipients.
 In a study comparing the safety of 1 dose of single-antigen varicella vaccine with that
of 2 doses administered 3 
months apart, no serious adverse events related to vaccination were reported among
approximately 2,000 healthy subjects aged 
12  months--12  years  who  were  followed  for  42  days  after  each  injection.  The  2-dose
vaccine regimen was generally 
well-tolerated,  and  its  safety  profile  was  comparable  to  that  of  the  1-dose  regimen.
Incidence of injection site complaints 
observed <3 days after vaccination was slightly higher after dose 2 (25.4%) than after
dose 1 (21.7%). Incidence of systemic clinical 
complaints was lower after dose 2; fever incidence from days 7--21 was 7% after dose 1
and 4% after dose 2 (p = 0.009), and 
varicelliform rash incidence after dose 1 was 3%, compared with 1% after dose 2 (p =
0.008), with peak occurrence 8--21 days 
after vaccination (139).
 In uncontrolled trials of persons aged 
>13 years , approximately 1,600 vaccine recipients who received 1 dose of 
single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  and  955  who  received  2  doses  of  vaccine  were
monitored for 42 days for adverse events 
(79).  After  the  first  and  second  doses,  24.4%  and  32.5%  of  vaccine  recipients,
respectively, had complaints regarding the injection 
site. Varicella-like rash at the injection site occurred in 3% of vaccine recipients after
the first injection and in 1% after the 
second.  A  nonlocalized  rash  occurred  in  5.5%  of  vaccine  recipients  after  the  first
injection and in 0.9% of vaccine recipients after 
the second, at a peak of 7--21 and 0--23 days postvaccination, respectively.
 
Combination MMRV Vaccine
 In clinical trials, combination MMRV vaccine was administered to 4,497 children aged
12--23 months 
without concomitant administration with other vaccines 
(80). The safety profile of the first dose was compared with the safety 
of MMRII vaccine and VARIVAX administered concomitantly at separate injection sites.
The follow-up period was 42 
days  postvaccination.  Systemic  vaccine-related  adverse  events  were  reported  at  a
statistically significantly greater rate in persons 
who  received  MMRV  vaccine  than  in  persons  who  received  the  two  vaccines
administered concomitantly at separate 
injection sites: fever (>102°F 
[>38.9°C]  oral  equivalent),  (21.5%  and  14.9%,  respectively),  and  measles-like  rash
(3.0% and 
2.1%, respectively). Both fever and measles-like rash usually occurred within 5--12 days
after the vaccination, were of short 
duration, and resolved with no long-term sequelae. Pain, tenderness, and soreness at
the injection site were reported at a 
statistically  significantly  lower  rate  in  persons  who  received  the  combination  MMRV
vaccine (22.0%) than in those who received 
MMRII  and  VARIVAX  vaccines  (26.7%).  Rash  at  the  injection  site  was  more  frequent
among recipients of 
1-dose MMRV vaccine (2.3%) than among recipients of the two vaccines administered
separately as first doses (1.5%). A study that also 
compared  use  of  MMRV  with  MMRII  and  VARIVAX  administered  as  a  first  dose
demonstrated similar results 
(90). During days 5--12, children in the group that received MMRV had higher rates of
elevated temperatures than those in the group that 
received MMRII and VARIVAX (27.7% and 18.7%, respectively; p = 0.034).
 To demonstrate that MMRV vaccine could be administered as a second dose, a study
was conducted involving 799 
children  aged  4--6  years  who  had  received  primary  doses  of  MMRII  and  VARIVAX
vaccines, either concomitantly or not, at age 
>12 months and >1 month before study enrollment 
(91). These children were vaccinated randomly (with MMRV and 
placebo, MMR and placebo, or MMRII and VARIVAX) and then monitored for safety. No
serious vaccine-related adverse 
experiences  were  reported.  Overall,  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  one  or  more
adverse event were comparable among groups 
receiving  MMRV,  MMRII,  and  MMRII  and  VARIVAX.  The  group  receiving  MMRV  vaccine
had a statistically significantly 
greater proportion of subjects with erythema (p = 0.01) and swelling (p = 0.008) at the
injection site 1--5 days after 
vaccination.  Another  study  examined  the  safety  of  2  doses  of  MMRV  administered  3
months apart to 480 children aged 12--23 
months (90). The rate of adverse events typically was lower after the second dose of
MMRV than after the first dose. The incidence 
of varicella-like rashes was lower after a second dose of MMRV than after concomitant
administration of MMRII and 
VARIVAX vaccines (0.0% and 1.9%, respectively; p = 0.01).
Postlicensure
 During  March  1,  1995--December  31,  2005,  a  total  of  47.7  million  doses  of  varicella
vaccine were distributed in the 
United  States,  and  25,306  adverse  events  that  occurred  after  varicella  vaccine
administration were reported to VAERS, 1,276 (5%) 
of which were classified as serious. The overall adverse event reporting rate was 52.7
cases per 100,000 doses distributed. The 
rate 
of reporting of serious adverse events was 2.6 per 100,000 doses distributed. Half of all
adverse events reported 
occurred among children aged 12--23 months (VAERS, 
unpublished data, 2006).
 Not all adverse events that occur after vaccination are 
reported, and many reports describe events that might have 
been  caused  by  confounding  or  unrelated  factors  (e.g.,  medications  and  other
diseases). Because varicella disease continues to 
occur,  wild-type  virus  might  account  for  certain  reported  events.  For  serious  adverse
events for which background incidence data 
are  known,  VAERS  reporting  rates  are  lower  than  expected  after  natural  varicella  or
than background rates of disease in 
the  community.  Inherent  limitations  of  passive  safety  surveillance  impede  comparing
adverse event rates after vaccination 
reported to VAERS with those from complications after natural disease. Nevertheless,
the magnitude of these differences suggests 
that serious adverse events occur at a substantially 
lower rate after vaccination than after natural disease. This assumption 
is  corroborated  by  the  substantial  decline  in  the  number  of  severe  complications,
hospitalizations, and deaths related to 
varicella  that  have  been  reported  since  implementation  of  the  varicella  vaccination
program 
(22,23,28).
 Similar  to  the  prelicensure  experience,  postlicensure  safety  surveillance  data  after
administration of single-antigen 
varicella vaccine indicated that rash, fever, and injection-site reactions were the most
frequently reported adverse events 
(140,141). Using these reports from passive surveillance of adverse events during the
first 4 years of the vaccination program, when 
wild-type  VZV  was  still  circulating  widely,  polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  analysis
confirmed that the majority of rash 
events  occurring  within  42  days  of  vaccination  were  caused  primarily  by  wild-type
varicella-zoster virus. Rashes from the 
wild-type  virus  occurred  a  median  of  8  days  after  vaccination  (range:  1--24  days),
whereas rashes from the vaccine strain occurred 
a median of 21 days after vaccination (range: 5--42 days) 
(140).
 As  part  of  postmarketing  evaluation  of  the  short-term  safety  of  VARIVAX,  89,753
vaccinated adults and children 
were identified from automated clinical databases of hospitals, emergency room visits,
and clinic visits during April 
1995--December 1996 (56). Out of all potential adverse events identified, no consistent
time association or clustering of any 
events  was  noted  during  the  exposure  follow-up  period.  No  cases  of  ataxia  or
encephalitis were identified after receipt of 
varicella  vaccine  in  this  group  of  vaccine  recipients.  In  the  prevaccine  era,  among
children aged <15 years, acute cerebellar ataxia 
was  estimated  to  occur  at  a  rate  of  one  in  4,000  varicella  cases,  and  varicella
encephalitis without ataxia was estimated to 
occur at one in 33,000 varicella cases (142).
 Severe  complications  that  are  laboratory-confirmed  to  be  caused  by  vaccine  virus
strain are rare and include 
pneumonia (140), hepatitis (143), severe disseminated varicella infection 
(140,141,144,145), and secondary transmission from 
five  vaccine  recipients  (140,146--148).  Except  for  the  secondary  transmission  cases,
these cases all occurred 
in  immunocompromised  patients  or  in  persons  who  had  other  serious  medical
conditions that were undiagnosed at the time 
of vaccination.
 Although other serious adverse events have been reported, vaccine strain involvement
was not 
laboratory-confirmed. Thrombocytopenia 
(140,141,149) and acute cerebellar ataxia 
(140,141,150) have been described as potentially 
associated  with  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine.  Two  children  had  acute  hemiparesis
diagnosed after varicella vaccination (one at 5 
days and the other at 3 weeks) (151). In both cases, unilateral 
infarction of the basal ganglia and internal capsule was noted; 
this distribution is consistent with varicella angiopathy. Urticaria after varicella vaccine
has been associated with gelatin 
allergy (152). Recurrent papular urticaria has been reported to be potentially associated
with varicella vaccination 
(153). However, available data regarding the potential adverse events after 
varicella vaccination are insufficient to determine a 
causal association. The quality of reported information varies widely, and simultaneous
administration with other 
vaccines (especially MMR) might confound attribution.
 Herpes Zoster. Similar to wild-type VZV, vaccine virus can establish latent infection and
subsequently reactivate, causing 
HZ  disease  in  vaccine  recipients.  Before  vaccine  licensure,  studies  in  children  with
leukemia had demonstrated a much lower rate 
of  HZ  in  vaccinated  children  compared  with  those  (age  and  protocol  matched)  with
previous varicella 
(54). Cases of HZ in healthy vaccine recipients have been confirmed to be caused by
both vaccine virus and wild-type virus, suggesting that certain HZ cases 
in vaccine recipients might result from antecedent natural 
varicella infection that might not have been detected by the 
patient or from infection after vaccination 
(140). A single case has been reported of a child who received a diagnosis of 
neuroblastoma  and  had  severe  chronic  zoster  attributed  to  vaccine  virus  strain  that
with time became drug resistant 
(145). A large postlicensure safety study performed through surveys conducted every 6
months and validated by medical chart review in the first 9 years of a 
15-year follow-up study of >7,000 enrolled children vaccinated with 
single-antigen varicella vaccine at age 12--24 months estimated 
HZ disease incidence to be 22 per 100,000 person-years (CI = 13--37) as reported by
parents (Steven Black, MD, 
Northern 
California Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, unpublished presentation, 2005).
The incidence of HZ was 30 per 
100,000 person-years among healthy children aged 5--9 years 
(154) and 46 per 100,000 person-years for those aged 
<14 years (64). However, these rates are drawn from different populations and based
on different methodologies. In addition, a proportion 
of  children  in  these  age  groups  would  not  have  experienced  varicella  disease;  those
rates are likely to underestimate rates in a 
cohort of children all infected with wild-type VZV, making direct comparison 
difficult with a vaccinated cohort.
Transmission of Vaccine Virus
 Results from prelicensure vaccine trials of the 
single-antigen varicella vaccine suggest that transmission of varicella 
vaccine  virus  from  healthy  persons  to  susceptible  contacts  is  rare.  This  risk  was
assessed in siblings of healthy vaccinated children 
who  themselves  received  placebo  (103).  Six  (1%)  of  439  placebo  recipients
seroconverted without rash; the vaccinated siblings 
of these six children also did not develop rash. Serologic data suggested that three of
these six seroconverters received 
vaccine  mistakenly  in  lieu  of  their  siblings.  In  a  smaller  study,  immunocompromised
siblings of healthy children 
receiving  varicella  vaccine  were  evaluated  clinically  and  by  testing  for  humoral  or
cell-mediated immune responses 
(155).  No  evidence  was  demonstrated  of  vaccine  virus  transmission  to  any  of  30
immunocompromised 
siblings from 37 healthy children receiving varicella vaccine.
 Accumulated  data  from  postlicensure  surveillance  activities  suggest  that  the  risk  for
transmission of varicella vaccine 
virus  from  healthy  persons  to  susceptible  contacts  is  low.  With  >55  million  doses  of
VARIVAX distributed since 
licensure,  transmission  from  immunocompetent  persons  after  vaccination  has  been
documented by PCR analysis from only five 
persons, resulting in six secondary infections, all of them mild 
(140,146--148). Three episodes involved transmission from 
healthy children aged 1 year to healthy household contacts, including a sibling aged 4
months, a father, and a pregnant mother. In 
the latter episode, the mother chose to terminate the pregnancy, but fetal tissue tested
subsequently by PCR was negative 
for  varicella  vaccine  virus  (147).  The  children  in  these  episodes  had  2,  12,  and  30
lesions, respectively. A fourth episode 
involved transmission from an immunocompetent adolescent who was a resident in an
institution for chronically disabled children. 
The adolescent had >500 lesions after vaccination, and vaccine virus was transmitted
to another immunocompetent resident of 
the institution and to a health-care worker, both of whom had histories of varicella 
(146). The fifth episode represented a 
tertiary spread from a healthy sibling contact of a vaccinee with leukemia 
(148). Rashes for both healthy siblings were mild (i.e., 
40  and  11  lesions,  respectively),  and  vaccine  virus  was  isolated  from  all  three
case-patients. The third sibling had rash 18 
days after the onset of the secondary case-patient and 33 days after rash onset in the
vaccinated leukemic child. In addition to 
these five episodes, one child has been reported to have transmitted vaccine virus from
HZ that occurred 5 months after 
varicella  vaccination;  2  weeks  later,  a  mild  varicella-like  rash  from  which  vaccine
varicella virus was isolated occurred in the 
child's vaccinated brother (156).
 Although  varicella  vaccine  is  not  recommended  for  children  with  cellular  immune
deficiencies, the experience 
from  prelicensure  vaccine  trials  involving  children  with  leukemia  is  instructive.  Data
from a study of varicella vaccination 
in children with leukemia indicated that varicella virus vaccine transmission occurred in
15 (17%) of 88 healthy, 
susceptible siblings of leukemic vaccine recipients; the rash was mild in 11 (73%) of the
15 infected siblings 
(148). The risk for transmission was correlated with the number of skin lesions in the
immunocompromised vaccine recipients.
 These  data  suggest  that  healthy,  vaccinated  persons  have  a  minimal  risk  for
transmitting vaccine virus to their 
contacts, particularly in the absence of vaccine rash in the vaccine 
recipient. Vaccine recipients who have a vaccine-related 
rash, particularly HCP and household contacts of immunocompromised persons, should
avoid contact with persons 
without  evidence  of  immunity  who  are  at  high  risk  for  severe  complications  (see
Health-Care Personnel)
Summary of Rationale for Varicella Vaccination
 Varicella vaccine is an effective prevention tool for decreasing the burden attributable
to varicella disease and 
its complications in the United States. In the prevaccine era, varicella was a childhood
disease with >90% of the 4 million 
cases, two thirds of approximately 11,000 hospitalizations, and 
approximately half of 100--150 annual deaths occurring 
among persons aged <20 years. Single-antigen varicella vaccine is 
licensed for use among healthy persons aged 
>12 months, and the combination MMRV vaccine is licensed for use in healthy children
aged 12 months--12 years. Prelicensure and 
postlicensure 
studies  have  demonstrated  that  1  dose  of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  is
approximately 85% effective in preventing 
varicella. Breakthrough varicella disease that occurs 
after vaccination frequently is mild and modified. 
Varicella  vaccine  is  >95%  effective  in  preventing  severe  varicella  disease.  Since
implementation of the varicella vaccination program in 1995, varicella 
incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths have declined substantially. MMRV was licensed
on the basis of immunological noninferiority 
to  its  vaccine  antigenic  components.  Initial  varicella  vaccine  policy  recommendations
were for 1 dose of varicella vaccine 
for children aged 12 months--12 years and 2 doses, 4--8 weeks apart, for persons aged 
>13 years. In June 2006, ACIP approved a routine 2-dose recommendation for children.
The first dose should be administered at age 12--15 months and the second 
dose at age 4--6 years.
 The rationale for the second dose of varicella vaccine for children is to further decrease
varicella disease and its 
complications in the United States. Despite the successes of the 
1-dose vaccination program in children, vaccine effectiveness of 85% has 
not  been  sufficient  to  prevent  varicella  outbreaks,  which,  although  less  than  in  the
prevaccine era, have continued to occur 
in highly vaccinated school populations. Breakthrough varicella is contagious. Studies of
the immune response after 1 and 
2  doses  of  varicella  vaccine  demonstrate  a  greater-than-tenfold  boost  in  GMTs  when
measured 6 weeks after the second 
varicella  vaccine  dose.  A  higher  proportion  (>99%)  of  children  achieve  an  antibody
response of 
>5  gpELISA  units  after  the  second  dose  compared  with  76%--85%  of  children  after  a
single dose of varicella vaccine. The second dose of varicella vaccine is 
expected  to  provide  improved  protection  to  the  15%--20%  of  children  who  do  not
respond adequately to the first dose. Data from 
a randomized clinical trial conducted postlicensure indicated that vaccine efficacy after 
2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine in children (98.3%; CI = 97.3%--99.0%) was
significantly higher than that after a single dose (94.4%; CI 
=92.9%--95.7%). The risk for breakthrough disease was 3.3-fold lower among children
who 
received 2 doses than it was among children who received 
1 dose. How this increase in vaccine efficacy (typically higher than observed under field
conditions) will translate 
into vaccine effectiveness under conditions of community use will be an important area
of study.
 The  recommended  ages  for  routine  first  (at  age  12--15  months)  and  second  (at  age
4--6 years) doses of varicella vaccine 
are harmonized with the recommendations for MMR vaccine use and intended to limit
the period when children have 
no varicella antibody. The recommended age for the 
second dose is supported by the current epidemiology of 
varicella,  with  low  incidence  and  few  outbreaks  among  preschool-aged  children  and
higher incidence and more outbreaks among 
elementary-school--aged children. However, the second dose may be administered at
an earlier age, provided that the interval between 
the first and second doses is 3 months. The recommendation for the minimum interval
between doses is made on the basis of 
the design of the studies evaluating 2 doses among children aged 12 months--12 years.
MMRV vaccine may be used to 
vaccinate  children  against  measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella  simultaneously.
Because the risk for transmission can be high 
among students in schools, colleges, and other postsecondary educational institutions,
students without evidence of immunity 
should receive 2 doses of varicella vaccine. All children and adolescents who received 
1 dose of varicella vaccine previously should receive a second dose.
 Varicella  disease  is  more  severe  and  its  complications  more  frequent  among
adolescents and adults. The recommendation 
for vaccination of all adolescents and adults without 
evidence of immunity will provide protection in these age groups. 
Because  varicella  might  be  more  severe  in  immunocompromised  persons  who  might
not be eligible for vaccination, and because of 
the risk of VZV transmission in health-care settings, HCP must be vaccinated. Varicella 
disease during the first two trimesters of pregnancy might 
infect  the  fetus  and  result  in  congenital  varicella  syndrome.  Therefore,  routine
antenatal screening 
for  evidence  of  immunity  and  postpartum  vaccination  for  those  without  evidence  of
immunity now is recommended.
Recommendations for the Use of Varicella Vaccines
 Two 0.5-mL doses of varicella vaccine administered subcutaneously are recommended
for children aged 
>12 months, adolescents, and adults without evidence of immunity. For children aged
12 months--12 years, the recommended 
minimum interval between the two doses is 3 months. However, if the second dose was
administered 
>28 days after the first dose, the second dose is considered valid and need not be 
repeated. For persons aged >13 years, the recommended minimum 
interval is 4 weeks. Single-antigen varicella vaccine is approved for use among healthy
persons aged 
>12 months. Combination MMRV vaccine is approved for use among healthy children
aged 12 months--12 years. MMRV vaccine is indicated for 
simultaneous  vaccination  against  measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella.  Whenever
any components of the combination vaccine 
are 
indicated and the other components are not 
contraindicated, use of licensed combination vaccines, such as MMRV vaccine, 
is preferred over separate injection of equivalent component vaccines 
(157).
Routine Vaccination
 
Persons Aged 12 Months--12 Years
 Preschool-Aged Children
 All  healthy  children  should  receive  their  first  dose  of  varicella-containing  vaccine
routinely at age 12--15 months.
 School-Aged Children
 A second dose of varicella vaccine is recommended routinely for all children aged 4--6
years (i.e., before 
entering  prekindergarten,  kindergarten,  or  first  grade).  However,  it  may  be
administered at an earlier age provided that the 
interval between the first and second dose is >3 months.
 Because  of  the  risk  for  transmission  of  VZV  in  schools,  all  children  entering  school
should have received 2 doses of 
varicella-containing  vaccine  or  have  other  evidence  of  immunity  to  varicella  (see
Evidence of Immunity).
 
Persons Aged >13 Years
 Persons  aged  >13  years  without  evidence  of  varicella  immunity  should  receive  two
0.5-mL doses of single-antigen 
varicella  vaccine  administered  subcutaneously,  4--8  weeks  apart.  If  >8  weeks  elapse
after the first dose, the second dose may 
be administered without restarting the schedule. Only single-antigen varicella vaccine
may be used for vaccination of persons 
in this age group. MMRV is not licensed for use among persons aged 
>13 years.
 School-Aged  Children,  College  Students,  and  Students  in  Other  Postsecondary
Educational Institutions
 All students should be assessed for varicella immunity, and those without evidence of
immunity should routinely receive 
2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine 4--8 weeks apart. The risk for transmission of
varicella among school-aged 
children, college students, and students in other postsecondary educational institutions
can be high because of high contact rates.
 Other Adults
 All  healthy  adults  should  be  assessed  for  varicella  immunity,  and  those  who  do  not
have evidence of immunity 
should receive 2 doses of single-antigen varicella vaccine 4--8 weeks apart. Adults who
might be at increased risk for exposure 
or  transmission  and  who  do  not  have  evidence  of  immunity  should  receive  special
consideration for vaccination, 
including  1)  HCP,  2)  household  contacts  of  immunocompromised  persons,  3)  persons
who live or work in environments in 
which transmission of VZV is likely (e.g., teachers, day-care employees, residents and
staff in institutional settings), 4) persons 
who live or work in environments in which transmission has been reported (e.g., college
students, inmates and staff members 
of  correctional  institutions,  and  military  personnel),  5)  nonpregnant  women  of
childbearing age, 6) adolescents and adults 
living in households with children, and 7) international travelers.
Second Dose Catch-Up Vaccination
 To improve individual protection against varicella and to have a more rapid impact on
school outbreaks, second dose 
catch-up  varicella  vaccination  is  recommended  for  children,  adolescents,  and  adults
who previously 
received 1 dose. The recommended minimum interval between the first dose and the
catch-up second dose is 3 months for children aged 
<12 years and 4 weeks for persons aged 
>13  years.  However,  the  catch-up  second  dose  may  be  administered  at  any  interval
longer 
than the minimum recommended interval. Catch-up vaccination may be implemented
during routine health-care provider 
visits and through school- and college-entry requirements.
 As  part  of  comprehensive  health  services  for  all  adolescents,  ACIP,  AAP,  and  AAFP
recommend a health maintenance visit 
at age 11--12 years. This visit also should serve as an immunization visit to evaluate
vaccination status and administer 
necessary  vaccinations  (158).  Physicians  should  use  this  and  other  routine  visits  to
ensure that all children without evidence of 
varicella immunity have received 2 doses of varicella vaccine.
Requirements for Entry to Child Care, School, College, and Other 
Postsecondary Educational Institutions
 Child care and school entry requirements for varicella 
immunity have been recommended previously 
(2). In 2005, ACIP recommended expanding the requirements to cover students in all
grade levels. Official health agencies should take 
necessary steps, including developing and enforcing school immunization requirements,
to ensure that students at all grade 
levels  (including  college)  and  children  in  child  care  centers  are  protected  against
varicella and other vaccine-preventable 
diseases (157).
Prenatal Assessment and Postpartum Vaccination
 Prenatal assessment of women for evidence of varicella 
immunity is recommended. Birth before 1980 is not 
considered  evidence  of  immunity  for  pregnant  women  because  of  potential  severe
consequences of varicella infection during 
pregnancy,  including  infection  of  the  fetus.  Upon  completion  or  termination  of  their
pregnancies, women who do not have evidence 
of varicella immunity should receive the first dose of vaccine before discharge from the
health-care 
facility. The second dose should be administered 4--8 weeks later, which 
coincides with the postpartum visit (6--8 weeks after delivery). For 
women who gave birth, the second dose should be administered 
at the postpartum visit. Women should be counseled to 
avoid conception for 1 month after each dose of varicella vaccine. Health-care settings
in which completion or termination 
of  pregnancy  occurs  should  use  standing  orders  to  ensure  the  administration  of
varicella vaccine to women 
without evidence of immunity.
Special Considerations for Vaccination
Vaccination of HIV-Infected Persons
 HIV-infected children with CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage >15% should be considered
for vaccination with the 
single-antigen  varicella  vaccine.  Varicella  vaccine  was  recommended  previously  for
HIV-infected children in CDC clinical 
and  immunologic  categories  N1  and  A1  with  age-specific  CD4+  T-lymphocyte
percentage 
>25% (2). Limited data from a 
clinical  trial  in  which  2  doses  of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  were  administered  3
months apart to 37 HIV-infected children 
(CDC  clinical  categories  N,  A,  or  B  and  immunologic  category  2  [CD4+  T-lymphocyte
percentage 
>15%--24%])  aged  1--8  years  indicated  that  the  vaccine  was  well-tolerated  and  that
>80% of subjects had detectable VZV specific 
immune  response  (either  antibody  or  cell  immune  response  or  both)  at  1  year  after
immunization 
(159). These children were no less likely to have 
an  antibody  response  to  the  varicella  vaccine  than  were  subjects  who  were  less
affected immunologically by HIV 
infection.  Because  children  infected  with  HIV  are  at  increased  risk  for  morbidity  from
varicella and HZ (i.e., shingles) compared 
with  healthy  children,  ACIP  recommends  that,  after  weighing  potential  risks  and
benefits, single-antigen varicella vaccine should 
be considered for HIV-infected children with CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentages 
>15%. Eligible children should receive 2 doses 
of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  3  months  apart.  Because  persons  with  impaired
cellular immunity are potentially at greater 
risk for complications after vaccination with a live vaccine, these vaccine 
recipients should be encouraged to return for evaluation 
if they experience a postvaccination varicella-like rash. Data are not available regarding
safety, immunogenicity, or efficacy 
of MMRV vaccine in HIV-infected children, MMRV vaccine should not be administered as
a substitute for the 
single-antigen varicella vaccine when vaccinating these children. The titer of Oka/Merck
VZV is higher in combination 
MMRV  vaccine  than  in  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine.  Recommendations  for
vaccination of HIV-infected children with 
measles, mumps, or rubella vaccines have been published previously 
(160).
 Data  on  use  of  varicella  vaccine  in  HIV-infected  adolescents  and  adults  are  lacking.
However, on the basis of expert 
opinion,  the  safety  of  varicella  vaccine  in  HIV-infected  persons  aged  >8  years  with
comparable levels of immune function 
(CD4+T-lymphocyte count >200 
cells/µL) is likely to be similar to that of children aged <8 years. Immunogenicity might
be lower 
in older HIV-infected children, adolescents, and adults compared to children aged 1--8
years. However, weighing the risk 
for severe disease from wild VZV and potential benefit of vaccination, vaccination may
be considered (2 doses, administered 
3 
months apart) for HIV-infected persons with CD4+T-lymphocytes count 
>200 cells/µL in these age groups. If vaccination 
of HIV-infected persons results in clinical disease, the use of acyclovir might modify the
severity of disease.
Situations in Which Some Degree of Immunodeficiency Might be Present
 Persons  with  impaired  humoral  immunity  may  be  vaccinated.  No  data  have  been
published concerning whether 
persons without evidence of immunity receiving only inhaled, nasal, or topical doses of
steroids can be vaccinated safely. 
However,  clinical  experience  suggests  that  vaccination  is  well-tolerated  among  these
persons. Persons without evidence of immunity 
who are receiving systemic steroids for certain conditions (e.g., asthma) and who are
not otherwise immunocompromised may 
be vaccinated if they are receiving <2 mg/kg of body weight or a total of <20 mg/day
of prednisone or its equivalent. 
Certain experts suggest withholding steroids for 2--3 weeks after vaccination if it can be
done safely 
(1).  Data  from  a  Japanese  study  using  the  Oka/Biken  varicella  vaccine  (which  is  not
available in the United States but whose immunogenicity and efficacy 
are similar to those of the varicella vaccine used in the United States) indicated that
children taking steroids for nephrosis 
were  vaccinated  safely  when  the  steroids  were  suspended  for  1--2  weeks  before
vaccination, although no 
serious  reactions  occurred  among  children  vaccinated  when  steroid  therapy  was  not
suspended 
(161). Persons who are receiving high doses of 
systemic steroids (i.e., >2 mg/kg prednisone) for 
>2 weeks may be vaccinated once steroid therapy has been discontinued for 
>1  month,  in  accordance  with  the  general  recommendations  for  the  use  of  live-virus
vaccines 
(157). 
 Vaccination of leukemic children who are in remission and who do not have evidence of
immunity to varicella should 
be undertaken only with expert guidance and with the availability of antiviral therapy
should complications ensue. Patients 
with  leukemia,  lymphoma,  or  other  malignancies  whose  disease  is  in  remission  and
whose chemotherapy has been terminated for 
at least 3 months can receive live-virus vaccines 
(157). When immunizing persons in whom some degree of 
immunodeficiency  might  be  present,  only  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  should  be
used.
Vaccination of Household Contacts of Immunocompromised Persons
 Immunocompromised persons are at high risk for serious varicella infections. Severe
disease occurs in approximately 30% 
of such persons with primary infection. Because varicella vaccine now is recommended
for all healthy children and 
adults  without  evidence  of  immunity,  household  contacts  of  immunocompromised
persons should be vaccinated routinely. 
Although  the  risk  for  exposure  to  wild  VZV  for  immunocompromised  persons  now  is
lower than it was previously, vaccine should 
be  offered  to  child  and  adult  household  contacts  without  evidence  of  immunity  of
immunocompromised persons. Vaccination 
of  household  contacts  provides  protection  for  immunocompromised  persons  by
decreasing the likelihood that wild-type 
VZV  will  be  introduced  into  the  household.  Vaccination  of  household  contacts  of
immunocompromised persons 
theoretically  might  pose  a  minimal  risk  for  transmission  of  vaccine  virus  to
immunocompromised persons, although in one study, 
no evidence of transmission of vaccine virus was demonstrated after vaccination of 37
healthy siblings of 30 children 
with  malignancy  (155).  No  cases  have  been  documented  of  transmission  of  vaccine
virus to immunocompromised persons in 
the  postlicensure  period  in  the  United  States,  with  >55  million  doses  of  vaccine
distributed. Other data indicate that 
disease  caused  by  vaccine  virus  in  immunocompromised  persons  is  milder  than
wild-type disease and can be treated with 
acyclovir  (148,159).  The  benefits  of  vaccinating  susceptible  household  contacts  of
immunocompromised persons outweigh 
the
 extremely
 low
 potential
 risk
 for
 transmission
 of
 vaccine
 virus
 to
immunocompromised contacts. Vaccine recipients in 
whom  vaccine-related  rash  occurs,  particularly  HCP  and  household  contacts  of
immunocompromised persons, should avoid 
contact  with  susceptible  persons  who  are  at  high  risk  for  severe  complications.  If  a
susceptible, immunocompromised person 
is  inadvertently  exposed  to  a  person  who  has  a  vaccine-related  rash,  postexposure
prophylaxis with VZIG is not 
needed because disease associated with this type of virus is expected to be mild.
Nursing Mothers
 Postpartum vaccination of women without evidence of immunity need not be delayed
because of breastfeeding. 
Women  who  have  received  varicella  vaccination  postpartum  may  continue  to
breastfeed. The majority of live vaccines are 
not associated with virus secretion in breast milk 
(157). A study involving 12 women who received single-antigen varicella 
vaccine while breastfeeding indicated no evidence of VZV DNA either in 217 breast milk
samples collected or in infants tested 
after both vaccine doses (162). No infants seroconverted. Another study did not detect
varicella gene sequences in 
the 
postvaccination breast milk samples (163). Therefore, single-antigen varicella vaccine
should be administered to 
nursing  mothers  without  evidence  of  immunity.  Combination  MMRV  vaccine  is  not
licensed for use among persons aged 
>13 years.
Health-Care Personnel
 Nosocomial transmission of VZV is well-recognized 
(131,164--173), and guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial 
VZV infection and for infection control in HCP have been published 
(174,175). Sources of nosocomial exposure have 
included patients, hospital staff, and visitors (e.g., the children of hospital employees)
who are infected with varicella or HZ. 
In hospitals, airborne transmission of VZV has been demonstrated when varicella has
occurred in susceptible persons who had 
no direct contact with the index case-patient 
(176--180).
 To  prevent  disease  and  nosocomial  spread  of  VZV,  health-care  institutions  should
ensure that all HCP have evidence 
of immunity to varicella. Birth before 1980 is not considered evidence of immunity for
HCP because of the possibility 
of  nosocomial  transmission  to  high-risk  patients.  In  health-care  institutions,  serologic
screening before vaccination of 
personnel  who  have  a  negative  or  uncertain  history  of  varicella  and  who  are
unvaccinated is likely to be cost effective. Institutions 
may elect to test all HCP regardless of disease history because a small proportion of
persons with a positive history of 
disease might be susceptible.
 Routine testing for varicella immunity after 2 doses of vaccine is not recommended for
the management of vaccinated 
HCP.  Available  commercial  assays  are  not  sensitive  enough  to  detect  antibody  after
vaccination in all instances. Sensitive tests 
have indicated that 99% of adults develop antibodies after the second dose. However,
seroconversion does not always result in 
full  protection  against  disease,  and  no  data  regarding  correlates  of  protection  are
available for adults.
 HCP  who  have  received  2  doses  of  vaccine  and  who  are  exposed  to  VZV  should  be
monitored daily during days 10--21 
after exposure through the employee health program or by an infection control nurse to
determine clinical status (i.e., daily 
screen for fever, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms). Persons with varicella might be
infectious up to 2 days before rash onset. 
In addition, HCP should be instructed to report fever, headache, or other constitutional
symptoms and any atypical skin 
lesions  immediately.  HCP  should  be  placed  on  sick  leave  immediately  if  symptoms
occur. Health-care institutions should 
establish  protocols  and  recommendations  for  screening  and  vaccinating  HCP  and  for
management of HCP after exposures in the 
work place.
 HCP who have received 1 dose of vaccine and who are 
exposed to VZV should receive the second dose with 
single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  within  3--5  days  after  exposure  to  rash  (provided  4
weeks have elapsed after the first dose). After 
vaccination, management is similar to that of 2-dose vaccine recipients.
 Unvaccinated HCP who have no other evidence of immunity who are exposed to VZV
are potentially infective from 
days 10--21 after exposure and should be furloughed during this period. They should
receive postexposure vaccination as soon 
as possible. Vaccination within 3--5 days of exposure to rash might modify the disease
if infection occurred. Vaccination >5 
days  postexposure  still  is  indicated  because  it  induces  protection  against  subsequent
exposures (if the current 
exposure did not cause infection).
 The risk for transmission of vaccine virus from vaccine 
recipients in whom varicella-like rash occurs after vaccination is 
low  and  has  been  documented  after  exposures  in  households  and  long-term  care
facilities 
(140,146--148). No cases have been documented after vaccination of HCP. The benefits
of vaccinating HCP without evidence of immunity outweigh 
this  extremely  low  potential  risk.  As  a  safeguard,  institutions  should  consider
precautions for personnel in whom rash occurs 
after vaccination. HCP in whom a vaccine-related rash occurs should avoid contact with
persons without 
evidence  of  immunity  who  are  at  risk  for  severe  disease  and  complications  until  all
lesions resolve (i.e., are crusted over or fade away) or no 
new lesions appear within a 24-hour period.
Varicella IgG Antibody Testing
 The  tests  most  widely  used  to  detect  varicella  IgG  antibody  after  natural  varicella
infection among HCP are 
latex  agglutination  (LA)  and  ELISA.  A  commercially  available  LA  test  using  latex
particles coated with VZV glycoprotein 
antigens can be completed in 15 minutes and does not require special equipment 
(181). The sensitivity and specificity of the LA 
test  are  comparable  to  those  of  FAMA  in  detecting  antibody  response  after  natural
varicella infection. The LA test generally 
is more sensitive than commercial ELISAs. The LA test has detected antibody for up to
11 years after varicella vaccination 
(182). 
However, for the purpose of screening HCP for varicella susceptibility, a less sensitive
and more specific commercial 
ELISA should be considered. A recent report indicated that the LA test can 
produce false-positive results, particularly when only 
a single concentration of serum is evaluated 
(183); this led to documented cases of false-positive results in HCP 
who consequently remained unvaccinated and subsequently contracted varicella.
Vaccination for Outbreak Control
 Varicella vaccination is recommended for outbreak control. Persons who do not have
adequate evidence of immunity 
should  receive  their  first  or  second  dose  as  appropriate.  Additionally,  in  outbreaks
among preschool-aged children, 2-dose vaccination 
is  recommended  for  optimal  protection,  and  children  vaccinated  with  1  dose  should
receive their second dose provided 
3  months  have  elapsed  since  the  first  dose.  State  and  local  health  departments  may
advise exposed persons who do not have evidence 
of  immunity  to  contact  their  health-care  providers  for  vaccination,  or  they  may  offer
vaccination through the health department 
or  school  (or  other  institutions)  vaccination  clinics.  Although  outbreak  control  efforts
optimally should be implemented as soon 
as  an  outbreak  is  identified,  vaccination  should  be  offered  even  if  the  outbreak  is
identified late. Varicella outbreaks in 
certain  settings  (e.g.,  child  care  facilities,  schools,  or  institutions)  can  last  as  long  as
4--5 months. Thus, offering vaccine during 
an  outbreak  might  provide  protection  to  persons  not  yet  exposed  and  shorten  the
duration of the outbreak 
(184). Persons receiving either their first or second dose as part of the outbreak control
program may be readmitted to school 
immediately. Those vaccinated with the first dose as part of outbreak control measures
should be scheduled for the second dose as 
age  appropriate.  Persons  who  are  unvaccinated  and  without  other  evidence  of
immunity who do not receive vaccine should 
be excluded from institutions in which the outbreak is occurring until 21 days after the
onset of rash in the last case of varicella. 
In  addition,  for  school-aged  persons  covered  by  the  2-dose  school  vaccination
requirements, exclusion during an outbreak 
is recommended for those vaccine recipients who had 
received the first dose before the outbreak but not the second as part of 
the oubtreak control program. Persons at increased risk for severe varicella who have
contraindications to vaccination 
should receive VZIG within 96 hours of exposure.
Contraindications
General
 Adequate  treatment  provisions  for  anaphylactic  reactions,  including  epinephrine
injection (1:1000), should be available 
for immediate use should an anaphylactic reaction occur. 
Before administering a vaccine, health-care providers should obtain 
the  vaccine  recipient's  vaccination  history  and  determine  whether  the  individual  had
any previous reactions to any 
vaccine  including  Varivax,  ProQuad  or  any  measles,  mumps,  or  rubella  containing
vaccines.
Allergy to Vaccine Components
 The
 administration
 of
 live
 varicella-containing
 vaccines
 rarely
 results
 in
hypersensitivity. The information in the 
package insert should be reviewed carefully before vaccine is 
administered. Vaccination is contraindicated for persons who have 
a history of anaphylactic reaction to any component of the vaccine, including gelatin.
Single-antigen varicella vaccine does 
not contain preservatives or egg protein; these substances have caused hypersensitive
reactions to other vaccines. For 
the combination MMRV vaccine, live measles and live mumps vaccines are produced in
chick embryo culture. However, 
among  persons  who  are  allergic  to  eggs,  the  risk  for  serious  allergic  reactions  after
administration of measles- or 
mumps-containing vaccines is low. Because skin testing with vaccine is not predictive
of allergic reaction to vaccination, skin testing is 
not  required  before  administering  combination  MMRV  vaccine  to  persons  who  are
allergic to eggs 
(160). The majority of anaphylactic reactions to measles- and 
mumps-containing vaccines are associated not with hypersensitivity to egg antigens 
but  with  other  vaccine  components.  Neither  single-antigen  varicella  nor  combination
MMRV vaccines should be administered 
to  persons  who  have  a  history  of  anaphylactic  reaction  to  neomycin.  However,
neomycin allergy usually is manifested as a 
contact dermatitis, which is a delayed-type immune response rather than anaphylaxis.
For persons who experience such a response, 
the  adverse  reaction,  if  any,  would  appear  as  an  erythematous,  pruritic  nodule  or
papule present 48--96 hours after vaccination. 
A  history  of  contact  dermatitis  to  neomycin  is  not  a  contraindication  to  receiving
varicella vaccines.
Altered Immunity
 Single-antigen  varicella  and  combination  MMRV  vaccines  are  not  licensed  for  use  in
persons who have any 
malignant condition, including blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or
other malignant neoplasms affecting the 
bone  marrow  or  lymphatic  systems.  Combination  MMRV  vaccine  should  not  be
administered to persons with primary or 
acquired  immunodeficiency,  including  immunosuppression  associated  with  AIDS  or
other clinical manifestations of HIV 
infections,
 cellular
 immunodeficiencies,
 hypogammaglobulinemia,
 and
dysgammaglobulinemia. Combination MMRV vaccine should 
not  be  administered  as  a  substitute  for  the  component  vaccines  when  vaccinating
HIV-infected children.
 Varicella vaccines should not be administered to persons who have a family history of
congenital or 
hereditary immunodeficiency in first-degree relatives (e.g., parents and siblings) unless
the immune competence of the potential 
vaccine recipient has been clinically substantiated or verified by a 
laboratory.
 Varicella vaccines should not be administered to persons receiving high-dose systemic
immunosuppressive 
therapy, including persons on oral steroids 
>2 mg/kg of body weight or a total of 
>20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for 
persons who weigh >10 kg, when administered for 
>2 weeks. Such persons are more susceptible to infections than healthy 
persons.  Administration  of  varicella  vaccines  can  result  in  a  more  extensive
vaccine-associated rash or disseminated disease in 
persons receiving immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids 
(185). This contraindication does not apply 
to  persons  who  are  receiving  inhaled,  nasal,  or  topical  corticosteroids  or  low-dose
corticosteroids as are used 
commonly for asthma prophylaxis or for 
corticosteroid-replacement  therapy  (see  Situations  in  Which  Some  Degree  of
Immunodeficiency Might Be Present).
Pregnancy
 Because the effects of the varicella virus vaccine on the fetus are unknown, pregnant
women should not be 
vaccinated. Nonpregnant women who are vaccinated should avoid 
becoming pregnant for 1 month after each injection. For 
persons without evidence of immunity, having a pregnant household member is not a
contraindication to vaccination. 
 If a pregnant woman is vaccinated or becomes pregnant within 1 month of vaccination,
she should be counseled 
about  potential  effects  on  the  fetus.  Wild-type  varicella  poses  a  low  risk  to  the  fetus
(see Prenatal and Perinatal 
Exposure).  Because  the  virulence  of  the  attenuated  virus  used  in  the  vaccine  is  less
than that of the wild-type virus, the risk to the fetus, 
if any, should be even lower. In 1995, Merck and Co., Inc., in collaboration with CDC,
established the VARIVAX 
Pregnancy  Registry  to  monitor  the  maternal-fetal  outcomes  of  pregnant  women  who
were inadvertently administered 
varicella  vaccine  3  months  before  or  at  any  time  during  pregnancy  (to  report,  call:
1-800-986-8999) 
(186).  During  the  first  10  years  of  the  pregnancy  registry  no  cases  of  congenital
varicella syndrome or birth defects compatible with congenital varicella 
syndrome  have  been  documented  (187,188).  Among  131  live-born  infants  of
prospectively reported seronegative women (82 of 
whom were born to mothers vaccinated during the highest risk period [i.e., the first or
second trimester of pregnancy]), no 
birth  defects  consistent  with  congenital  varicella  syndrome  have  been  documented
(prevalence 
rate = 0; CI = 0--6.7%), and three major birth defects were reported (prevalence rate =
2.3%; CI = 0.5%--6.7%). The rate of occurrence of major birth 
defects from prospective reports in the registry was similar to the rate reported in the
general U.S. population (3.2%), and the 
defects indicated no specific pattern or target organ. Although the study results do not
exclude the possibility of risk for women 
who  received  inadvertent  varicella  vaccination  before  or  during  pregnancy,  the
potential risk, if any, is low.
Precautions
Illness
 Vaccination of persons who have acute severe illness, 
including untreated, active tuberculosis, should be postponed 
until recovery. The decision to delay vaccination depends on the severity of symptoms
and on the etiology of the disease. No 
data  are  available  regarding  whether  either  single-antigen  varicella  or  combination
MMRV vaccines exacerbate tuberculosis. 
Live attenuated measles, mumps, and rubella virus vaccines administered individually
might result in a temporary depression 
of tuberculin skin sensitivity. Therefore, if a tuberculin test is to be performed, it should
be administered either any time 
before,  simultaneously  with,  or  at  least  4--6  weeks  after  combination  MMRV  vaccine.
However, tuberculin skin testing is not 
a  prerequisite  for  vaccination  with  single-antigen  varicella  or  combination  MMRV
vaccines.
 Varicella vaccines may be administered to children without evidence of immunity who
have mild illnesses, with or 
without low-grade fever (e.g., diarrhea or upper-respiratory infection) 
(189). Physicians should be alert to the 
vaccine-associated  temperature  elevations  that  might  occur  predominantly  in  the
second week after vaccination, especially with 
combination  MMRV  vaccine.  Studies  suggest  that  failure  to  vaccinate  children  with
minor illnesses can impede 
vaccination efforts (190).
Thrombocytopenia
 Thrombocytopenia is not a contraindication for 
single-antigen varicella vaccine. No clinical data are available regarding 
the  development  or  worsening  of  thrombocytopenia  in  persons  vaccinated  with
combination MMRV vaccine. Cases 
of  thrombocytopenia  have  been  reported  after  MMR  vaccine  and  after  varicella
vaccination. Postmarketing experience with 
live  MMR  vaccine  indicates  that  persons  with  thrombocytopenia  might  develop  more
severe thrombocytopenia after 
vaccination.  For  vaccination  of  thrombocytopenic  children  with  combination  MMRV
vaccine, health-care providers should refer to 
the ACIP recommendations on MMR vaccination 
(160).
Recent Administration of Blood, Plasma, or Immune Globulin
 Although passively acquired antibody is known to interfere with response to measles
and rubella vaccines 
(191), the effect of the administration of immune globulin (IG) on the 
response to varicella virus vaccine is unknown. The duration 
of  interference  with  the  response  to  measles  vaccination  is  dose-related  and  ranges
from 3--11 months. Because of the 
potential  inhibition  of  the  response  to  varicella  vaccination  by  passively  transferred
antibodies, varicella vaccines should not 
be administered for the same intervals as measles vaccine (3--11 months, depending
on the dosage) after 
administration  of  blood  (except  washed  red  blood  cells),  plasma,  or  IG.  Suggested
intervals between administration of antibody-containing 
products for different indications and varicella vaccine have been published previously 
(157). In addition, persons who received a varicella vaccine should not be administered
an antibody-containing product for 2 weeks after vaccination unless the 
benefits exceed those of vaccination. In such cases, the vaccine recipient should either
be 
revaccinated or tested for immunity at the appropriate intervals, depending on the dose
received, and then revaccinated if seronegative. 
Use of Salicylates
 No  adverse  events  associated  with  the  use  of  salicylates  after  varicella  vaccination
have been reported; however, the 
vaccine manufacturer recommends that vaccine recipients avoid 
using salicylates for 6 weeks after receiving varicella vaccines 
because  of  the  association  between  aspirin  use  and  Reye  syndrome  after  varicella.
Vaccination with subsequent close monitoring 
should  be  considered  for  children  who  have  rheumatoid  arthritis  or  other  conditions
requiring therapeutic aspirin. The risk for 
serious complications associated with aspirin is likely to be greater in children in whom
natural varicella develops than it is in 
children who receive the vaccine containing attenuated 
VZV. No association has been documented between Reye syndrome 
and analgesics or antipyretics that do not contain salicylic acid.
Postexposure Prophylaxis
Healthy Persons
 Prelicensure data from the United States and Japan on varicella exposures in children
from household, hospital, 
and  community  settings  indicate  that  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  is  effective  in
preventing illness or modifying varicella 
severity  if  administered  to  unvaccinated  children  within  3  days,  and  possibly  up  to  5
days, of exposure to rash 
(78,101,192). Vaccination within 3 days of exposure to rash was 
>90% effective in preventing varicella whereas vaccination within 5 days 
of exposure to rash was approximately 70% effective in preventing varicella and 100%
effective in modifying severe 
disease (101,192). Limited postlicensure studies also have demonstrated that varicella
vaccine is highly effective in either preventing 
or modifying disease if administered within 3 days of exposure 
(193,194). Varicella vaccine is recommended for 
postexposure  administration  for  unvaccinated  persons  without  other  evidence  of
immunity. If exposure to VZV does not cause 
infection,  postexposure  vaccination  should  induce  protection  against  subsequent
exposures. If the exposure results in infection, 
no 
evidence  indicates  that  administration  of  single-antigen  varicella  vaccine  during  the
presymptomatic or prodromal stage 
of illness increases the risk for vaccine-associated 
adverse events. No data are available regarding the potential benefit 
of administering a second dose to 1-dose vaccine recipients after exposure. However,
administration of a second dose should 
be  considered  for  persons  who  have  previously  received  1  dose  to  bring  them
up-to-date. Studies on postexposure use of 
varicella  vaccine  have  been  conducted  exclusively  in  children.  A  higher  proportion  of
adults do not respond to the first dose of 
varicella  vaccine.  Nevertheless,  postexposure  vaccination  should  be  offered  to  adults
without evidence of immunity. 
Although  postexposure  use  of  varicella  vaccine  has  potential  applications  in  hospital
settings, vaccination is recommended routinely 
for  all  HCP  without  evidence  of  immunity  and  is  the  preferred  method  for  preventing
varicella in health-care settings 
(195). Preferably, HCP should be vaccinated when they begin employment. No data are
available on the use of combination 
MMRV raccine for postexposure prophylaxis.
Persons Without Evidence of Immunity Who Have Contraindications 
for Vaccination and Who Are at Risk for Severe Disease and Complications
 Studies  conducted  in  1969  indicated  that  clinical  varicella  was  prevented  in
nonimmune, healthy children by 
the administration of zoster immune globulin (ZIG) (prepared from patients recovering
from HZ) within 72 hours of 
exposure (196). ZIG also lowered attack rates among immunocompromised persons if
administered no later than 96 hours 
after  exposure  (196).  VZIG  (prepared  from  plasma  obtained  from  healthy,  volunteer
blood donors identified by routine 
screening to have high antibody titers to VZV) became 
available in 1978. Both serologic and clinical evaluations have demonstrated 
that  the  product  is  equivalent  to  ZIG  in  preventing  or  modifying  clinical  illness  in
non-immune, immunocompromised 
persons who are exposed to varicella 
(197,198).  In  a  study  of  immunocompromised  children  who  were  administered  VZIG
within 
96 hours of exposure, approximately one in five exposures resulted in clinical varicella,
and one in 20 resulted in 
subclinical disease (198). The severity of clinical varicella (evaluated by percentage of 
patients with >100 lesions or complications) 
was lower than expected on the basis of historic controls.
 The VZIG product currently used in the United States, 
VariZIG™(Cangene Corporation, Winnipeg, Canada), is 
available under an Investigational New Drug Application 
Expanded Access protocol (available at 
http://www.fda.gov/cber/infosheets/mphvzig020806.htm).  A  request  for  licensure  in
the United States might be submitted to FDA in the 
future.  VariZIG  is  a  lyophilized  presentation  which,  when  properly  reconstituted,  is
approximately a 5% solution of IgG that can be 
administered intramuscularly (199). VariZIG can be 
obtained 24 hours a day from the sole authorized U.S. 
distributor (FFF Enterprises, Temecula, California) at 1-800-843-7477 or online at 
http://www.fffenterprises.com.
Administration of VZIG
 VZIG  provides  maximum  benefit  when  administered  as  soon  as  possible  after
exposure, but it might be effective 
if  administered  as  late  as  96  hours  after  exposure.  The  effectiveness  of  VZIG  when
administered >96 hours after 
initial  exposure  has  not  been  evaluated.  The  duration  of  protection  provided  after
administration of VZIG is unknown, 
but protection should last at least one half-life of the IG (i.e., 
approximately 3 weeks). Susceptible persons at high risk for 
whom varicella vaccination is contraindicated and who are again exposed 
>3 weeks after receiving a dose of VZIG should 
receive  another  full  dose  of  VZIG.  Patients  receiving  monthly  high-dose  immune
globulin intravenous (IGIV) 
(>400  mg/kg)  are  likely  to  be  protected  and  probably  do  not  require  VZIG  if  the  last
dose of IGIV was administered <3 weeks before 
exposure (200). VZIG has not been proven to be useful in treating clinical varicella or
HZ or in preventing disseminated zoster and 
is not recommended for such use. VZIG might extend the incubation period of the virus
from 10--21 days to 
>28  days.  This  should  be  taken  into  account  after  exposures  when  VZIG  is
administered.
Dosage
 VariZIG is supplied in 125-U vials. The recommended dose is 125 units/10 kg of body
weight, up to a maximum of 
625 units (five vials). The minimum dose is 125 U. The human IgG content is 60--200
mg per 125 units dose of VariZIG.
Indications for the Use of VZIG for Postexposure Prophylaxis
 The decision to administer VZIG depends on three factors: 1) whether the patient lacks
evidence of immunity, 2) 
whether  the  exposure  is  likely  to  result  in  infection,  and  3)  whether  the  patient  is  at
greater risk for complications than the 
general population.
 Both healthy and immunocompromised children and adults who have verified positive
histories of varicella (except 
for  bone-marrow  transplant  recipients)  may  be  considered  immune  (see  Evidence  of
Immunity). The association between 
positive  histories  of  varicella  in  bone-marrow  donors  and  susceptibility  to  varicella  in
recipients after transplants has not been 
studied  adequately.  Thus,  persons  who  receive  bone-marrow  transplants  should  be
considered nonimmune, regardless of 
previous  history  of  varicella  disease  or  varicella  vaccination  in  themselves  or  in  their
donors. Bone-marrow recipients in whom 
varicella  or  HZ  develops  after  transplantation  should  subsequently  be  considered
immune.
 VZIG  is  not  indicated  for  persons  who  received  2  doses  of  varicella  vaccine  and
became immunocompromised as a 
result of disease or treatment later in life. These persons should be monitored closely; if
disease occurs, treatment with acyclovir 
should be instituted at the earliest signs or symptoms. For patients without evidence of
immunity and on steroid therapy doses 
>2 mg/kg of body weight or a total of 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, VariZIG is
indicated.
Types of Exposure
 Certain types of exposure can place persons without evidence of immunity at risk for
varicella. Direct contact exposure 
is defined as face-to-face contact with an infectious person while indoors. The duration
of face-to-face contact that 
warrants  administration  of  VZIG  is  not  certain.  However,  the  contact  should  not  be
transient. Certain experts suggest a contact of 
>5 minutes as constituting significant exposure for this purpose, whereas others define
close contact as >1 hour 
(200). Substantial exposure for hospital contacts consists of sharing the same hospital
room with an infectious patient or direct, 
face-to-face  contact  with  an  infectious  person  (e.g.,  HCP).  Brief  contacts  with  an
infectious person (e.g., contact with x-ray technicians 
or housekeeping personnel) are less likely than more 
prolonged contacts to result in VZV transmission.
 Persons  with  continuous  exposure  to  household  members  who  have  varicella  or
disseminated HZ are at greatest risk 
for infection. Varicella occurs in approximately 85% (range: 65%--100%) of susceptible
household contacts exposed to 
VZV. Localized HZ is much less infectious than varicella or disseminated HZ 
(52). Transmission from localized HZ is more 
likely  after  close  contact,  such  as  in  household  settings.  Physicians  may  consider
recommending postexposure prophylaxis 
with  VZIG  in  such  circumstances.  After  household  exposure  to  varicella,  attack  rates
among immunocompromised children 
who were administered VZIG were up to 60% 
(197). No comparative data are available for immunocompromised 
children without evidence of immunity who were not administered VZIG. However, the
incidence of severe disease 
(defined as >100 skin lesions) was less than that predicted from the natural history of
disease in normal children (27% and 87%, 
respectively), and the incidence of pneumonia was less than that described in children
with neoplasm (6% and 25%, respectively) 
(201). The risk for varicella after close contact (e.g., contact with playmates) or hospital
exposure is estimated to be 
approximately 20% of the risk occurring from household exposure.
 The  attack  rate  in  healthy  neonates  who  were  exposed  in  utero  within  7  days  of
delivery and who received VZIG after 
birth was 62%, which does not differ substantially from rates reported for neonates who
were similarly exposed but not treated 
with  VZIG  (49).  However,  the  occurrence  of  complications  and  fatal  outcomes  was
substantially lower for neonates who 
were treated with VZIG than for those who were not.
 In a study of pregnant women without immunity to VZV who were exposed to varicella
and administered VZIG, 
the infection rate was 30%. This is substantially lower than the expected rate of >70%
in unimmunized women exposed 
to varicella (199,202).
Recommendations for the Use of VZIG
 The  following  patient  groups  are  at  risk  for  severe  disease  and  complications  from
varicella and should receive VZIG:
 Immunocompromised  patients.  VZIG  is  used  primarily  for  passive  immunization  of
immunocompromised 
persons without evidence of immunity after direct exposure to varicella or disseminated
HZ patients, including persons who 1) 
have primary and acquired immune-deficiency disorders, 2) have neoplastic diseases,
and 3) are receiving 
immunosuppressive 
treatment. Patients receiving monthly high-dose IGIV 
(>400 mg/kg) are likely to be protected and probably do not 
require VZIG if the last dose of IGIV was administered 
<3 weeks before exposure (200).
 Neonates whose mothers have signs and symptoms of varicella around the time of 
delivery.  VZIG  is  indicated  for  neonates  whose  mothers  have  signs  and  symptoms  of
varicella from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery. VZIG is 
not necessary for neonates whose mothers have signs and symptoms of varicella more
than 5 days before delivery, because 
those  infants  should  be  protected  from  severe  varicella  by  transplacentally  acquired
maternal antibody. No evidence suggests 
that infants born to mothers in whom varicella occurs >48 hours after delivery are at
increased risk for serious complications 
(e.g., pneumonia or death).
 Premature  neonates  exposed  postnatally.  Transmission  of  varicella  in  the  hospital
nursery is rare because the majority 
of neonates are protected by maternal antibody. Premature 
infants who have substantial postnatal exposure should be 
evaluated  on  an  individual  basis.  The  risk  for  complications  of  postnatally  acquired
varicella in premature infants is 
unknown.  However,  because  the  immune  system  of  premature  infants  is  not  fully
developed, administration of VZIG to premature infants born 
at  >28  weeks  of  gestation  who  are  exposed  during  the  neonatal  period  and  whose
mothers do not have evidence of immunity 
is indicated. Premature infants born at <28 weeks of gestation or who weigh 
<1,000 g at birth and were exposed during 
the neonatal period should receive VZIG regardless of maternal immunity because such
infants might not have acquired 
maternal antibody. The majority of premature infants born at 
>28 weeks of gestation to immune mothers have enough 
acquired maternal antibody to protect them from severe disease and complications. 
Although  infants  are  at  higher  risk  than  older  children  for  serious  and  fatal
complications, the risk for healthy, full-term infants who have varicella after postnatal
exposure 
is substantially less than that for infants whose mothers were infected 
5 days before to 2 days after delivery. VZIG is 
not  recommended  for  healthy,  full-term  infants  who  are  exposed  postnatally,  even  if
their mothers have no history of 
varicella infection.
 Pregnant women. Because pregnant women might be at higher risk for severe varicella
and complications 
(37,42,203), VZIG should be strongly considered for pregnant women without evidence
of immunity who have been 
exposed.  Administration  of  VZIG  to  these  women  has  not  been  found  to  prevent
viremia, fetal infection, congenital varicella 
syndrome,  or  neonatal  varicella.  Thus,  the  primary  indication  for  VZIG  in  pregnant
women is to prevent complications of 
varicella in the mother rather than to protect the fetus. 
Neonates born to mothers who have signs and symptoms of varicella from 5 
days  before  to  2  days  after  delivery  should  receive  VZIG,  regardless  of  whether  the
mother received VZIG.
Interval Between Administration of VZIG and Varicella Vaccine
 Any  patient  who  receives  VZIG  to  prevent  varicella  should  receive  varicella  vaccine
subsequently, provided the vaccine is 
not contraindicated. Varicella vaccination should be delayed until 5 months after VZIG
administration. Varicella vaccine is 
not needed if the patient has varicella after administration of VZIG.
Antiviral Therapy
 Because VZIG might prolong the incubation period by 
>1 week, any patient who receives VZIG should be observed 
closely for signs or symptoms of varicella for 28 days after exposure. Antiviral therapy
should be instituted immediately if signs 
or  symptoms  of  varicella  disease  occur.  The  route  and  duration  of  antiviral  therapy
should be determined by specific host 
factors, extent of infection, and initial response to therapy. Information regarding how
to obtain VariZIG is available at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5508a5.htm 
(204).

for evidence of varicella 
immunity is recommended. Upon completion or termination 
of  pregnancy,  women  who  do  not  have  evidence  of  varicella  immunity  should  be
vaccinated.
Vaccination of HIV-Infected Persons
 Vaccination  should  be  considered  for  HIV-infected  children  with  age-specific  CD4+
T-lymphocyte percentage 
>15% and may be considered for adolescents and adults in with CD4+ T-lymphocyte
count 
>200 cells/µL. 
Outbreak Control
 All states should require that students at all grade levels 
(including college) and those in child care centers 
receive varicella vaccine unless they have other evidence of immunity of varicella.
Evidence of Immunity to Varicella
 Evidence of immunity to varicella includes any of the 
following:
 * For children who received their first dose at age <13 years and for whom the interval
between the 2 doses was 
>28 days, the second dose is considered valid.
 † Commercial assays can be used to assess disease-induced immunity, but they lack
sensitivity to always detect vaccine-induced immunity (i.e., they might 
yield false-negative results).
 § For health-care personnel, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons, birth
before 1980 should not be considered evidence of immunity.
 ¶  Verification  of  history  or  diagnosis  of  typical  disease  can  be  provided  by  any
health-care provider (e.g., school or occupational clinic nurse, nurse 
practitioner,  physician  assistant,  or  physician).  For  persons  reporting  a  history  of,  or
reporting with, atypical or mild cases, assessment by a physician or their designee 
is recommended, and one of the following should be sought: 1) an epidemiologic link to
a typical varicella case or to a laboratory-confirmed case or 2) 
evidence  of  laboratory  confirmation  if  it  was  performed  at  the  time  of  acute  disease.
When such documentation is lacking, persons should not be considered as having 
a valid history of disease because other diseases might mimic mild atypical varicella.
