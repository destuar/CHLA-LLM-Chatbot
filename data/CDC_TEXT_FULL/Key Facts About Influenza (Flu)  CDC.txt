viruses  that  infect  the  nose,  throat,  and  sometimes  the  lungs.  It  can  cause  mild  to
severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting
a flu vaccine each year. Flu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to
death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or
all of these signs and symptoms: *It’s important to note that not everyone with flu will
have  a  fever.  More  information  is  available  at   Flu  and  COVID-19  symptoms.  Most
experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with
flu  cough,  sneeze,  or  talk.  These  droplets  can  land  in  the  mouths  or  noses  of  people
who are nearby. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that
has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes. A
2018 CDC study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases looked at the percentage of
the U.S. population who got sick with flu using two different methods and compared the
findings. Both methods had similar findings, which suggested that on average, about 8
percent of the U.S. population gets sick from flu each season, with a range of between 3
percent  and  11  percent,  depending  on  the  season.  The  same  CID  study  found  that
children are most likely to get sick from flu and that people 65 and older are least likely
to get sick from flu. Median incidence values (or attack rate) by age group were 9.3%
for children 0-17 years, 8.8% for adults 18-64 years, and 3.9% for adults 65 years and
older.  This  means  that  children  younger  than  18  are  more  than  twice  as  likely  to
develop  a  symptomatic  influenza  virus  infection  than  adults  65  and  older.  Influenza
virus  infection  is  very  common,  and  the  number  of  people  infected  each  season  can
only  be  estimated  because  not  everyone  will  seek  medical  care  or  get  tested  for  flu.
Statistical  estimations  are  based  on CDC-measured  flu  hospitalization  rates that  are
adjusted to estimate the total number of influenza virus infections in the United States
for a given flu season. The estimates for the number of influenza virus infections are
then  divided  by  the  census  population  to  estimate  how  common  influenza  virus
infections  are  in  the  population  (called  seasonal  incidence  or  attack  rate).  Yes.  The
proportion of people who get sick with flu varies. A paper published in CID found that
between 3 percent and 11 percent of the U.S. population gets infected and develops flu
symptoms each year. The 3 percent estimate is from the 2011-2012 season, which was
an  H1N1-predominant  season  classified  as  being  of  low  severity.  The  estimated
incidence of flu illness during two seasons was around 11 percent; 2012-2013 was an
H3N2-predominant  season  classified  as  being  of  moderate  severity,  while  2014-2015
was an H3N2 predominant season classified as being of high severity.   * The burden
estimate for the 2020-2021 season was not calculated due to the uncharacteristically
low  level  of  flu  activity  that  season.  You  may  be  able  to  spread  flu  to  someone  else
before you know you are sick, as well as when you are sick with symptoms. The time
from  when  a  person  is  exposed  and  infected  with  influenza  virus  to  when  symptoms
begin is about two days, but can range from about one to four days. Complications of
flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections and worsening of
chronic  medical  conditions,  such  as  congestive  heart  failure,  asthma,  or  diabetes.
Anyone can get flu (including healthy people), and serious problems related to flu can
happen at any age, but some people are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related
complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any
age  with  certain  chronic  medical  conditions  (such  as  asthma,  diabetes,  or  heart
disease), people with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher, pregnant people,
and children younger than 5 years. The first and most important step in preventing flu is
to  get  a  flu  vaccine  each  year.  Flu  vaccine  has  been  shown  to  reduce  flu  related
illnesses  and  the  risk  of  serious  flu  complications  that  can  result  in  hospitalization  or
even death. CDC also recommends everyday preventive actions (like staying away from
people who are sick (distancing), covering coughs and sneezes, frequent handwashing,
and taking steps for cleaner air) to help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory
(nose, throat, and lungs) illnesses like flu. More information is available about core and
additional prevention strategies. It is very difficult to distinguish flu from other viral or
bacterial  respiratory  illnesses  based  on  symptoms  alone.  There  are  tests  available  to
diagnose  flu.  More  information  is  available:  Diagnosing  Flu.  There  are  flu  antiviral
drugs  that  can  be  used  to  treat  flu  illness.  More  information  is  available:  “Seasonal
Influenza,  More  Information.”  To  receive  weekly  email  updates  about  Seasonal  Flu,
