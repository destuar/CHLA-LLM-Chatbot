 Q fever is a disease caused by the bacteria Coxiella burnetii. These bacteria naturally
infect some animals, such as goats, sheep, and cows. These bacteria are found in the
birth products (i.e. placenta, amniotic fluid), urine, poop, and milk of infected animals.
People can get infected by breathing in dust that has been contaminated by infected
animal  feces,  urine,  milk,  and  birth  products.  Some  people  never  get  sick;  however,
those  who  do  usually  develop  flu-like  symptoms  including  fever,  chills,  fatigue,  and
muscle pain. Some people develop chronic Q fever after they are infected. People with
certain  jobs  are  at  increased  risk  for  exposure  to  Coxiella  burnetii,  including
veterinarians,  meat  processing  plant  workers,  dairy  workers,  livestock  ranchers,  and
researchers at facilities housing sheep and goats. People working in these areas may
need  to  take  extra  precautions  (see  MMWR  R&R:  Occupational  Exposure  and
Prevention). Q fever is caused by a bacteria. Some people never get sick; those who do
