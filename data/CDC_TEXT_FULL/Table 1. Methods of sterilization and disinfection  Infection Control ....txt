healthcare  field  is  dynamic,  and  products  may  become  available  that  are  not  in
existence  when  this  guideline  was  written.  As  newer  disinfectants  become  available,
persons  or  committees  responsible  for  selecting  disinfectants  and  sterilization
processes  should  be  guided  by  products  cleared  by  the  FDA  and  the  EPA  as  well  as
information  in  the  scientific  literature.  CDC  provides  information  on  infection  control
and  clinical  safety  to  help  reduce  the  risk  of  infections  among  healthcare  workers,
