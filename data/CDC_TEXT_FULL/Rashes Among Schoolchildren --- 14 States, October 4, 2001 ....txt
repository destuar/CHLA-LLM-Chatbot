and  the  title  of  the  report  in  the  subject  line  of  e-mail.  Fourteen  states  (Arizona,
Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania,  Texas,  Virginia,  Washington,  and  West  Virginia)  have  reported
investigations of multiple schoolchildren who have 
developed rashes. This report summarizes the investigation by state and local health
departments of these rashes, which have 
occurred during October 2001 through February 2002, and provides examples for four
states. Preliminary findings indicate that 
further  investigation  is  needed  to  determine  whether  a  common  etiology  for  these
rashes exists.
UNITED STATES
The first reported incident occurred October 4, 2001, in Indiana, followed by cases in
Virginia that began November 
20.  Subsequent  cases  of  rashes  began  in  late  January  and  occurred  as  recently  as
February 21. Rashes have been reported 
primarily from elementary schools but also among students in a few middle and high
schools. The number of affected students in 
each state ranges from <10 to approximately 600. A few teachers and school staff have
been affected, but rarely parents or siblings.
Characteristics  of  the  rashes  vary,  but  onset  has  generally  been  acute,  typically  with
maculopapular erythematous 
lesions---possibly in a reticulated pattern---on the face, neck, hands, or arms; duration
of the rash varied but in most reports it 
was highly pruritic. The rashes were not attributed to a defined environmental exposure
or infectious agent. Children with 
rashes  were  afebrile  and  usually  had  no  other  associated  signs  or  symptoms.  The
rashes lasted from a few hours to 2 weeks 
and  appeared  to  be  self-limiting.  Secondary  transmission  has  not  been  reported,  but
in-school "sympathy" cases have 
reportedly occurred. Diagnoses by clinicians who have examined children have included
viral exanthem, contact or atopic 
dermatitis,  eczema,  chemical  exposure,  impetigo,  and  poison  ivy.  Approximately  40
serum samples collected in four states have been 
PCR or IgM negative for parvovirus B19 (1); 22 nasal swab samples have been negative
for enterovirus. Environmental 
assessments have not identified environmental causes.
CASE REPORTS
Indiana. During October 4--November 2, 2001, rashes appeared among 18 third-grade
students in an elementary school 
of 390 students; one substitute teacher also developed rash. No rashes among family
members were reported. The rash 
most  often  began  on  the  face,  then  spread  to  the  upper  extremities;  most  rashes
occurred on exposed skin. Clinical 
signs---including  reddish  welt-type  itchy  rash  on  face  and  upper  extremities,  swollen
eyes, and smooth pink cheeks---degrees of coloration, 
and  prominence  of  rash  varied  among  the  children.  Diagnoses  in  the  few  children
examined by family physicians varied 
and included contact dermatitis, chemical exposure, impetigo, and poison ivy. Because
parvovirus B19 infection was diagnosed 
in one third-grade student on August 30, 2001, the Indiana State Department of Health
collected serum specimens from 
four  students  with  rashes  to  assess  whether  they  had  parvovirus  B19  infection.  All
specimens tested negative for the presence 
of  IgM  antibodies.  Laboratory  data  analysis,  interviews,  a  building  survey,  and
examination of the children did not identify 
a cause for the rashes.
Pennsylvania.  The  initial  report  of  rash  occurred  on  January  31,  2002,  among  54
elementary school students who 
had  contact  dermatitis  diagnosed  by  a  local  health-care  provider.  To  date,
approximately 575 cases of rashes have been reported 
to  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Health;  58  schools  and  child-care  centers  have
reported cases (range: one--168 cases 
per  facility).  Most  cases  are  in  elementary  and  middle  school  students,  with  female
cases outnumbering males. The rash has 
been  characterized  as  bright-red,  itchy  or  burning,  and  macular,  occasionally  with  an
urticarial or papular component. The 
rash may be evanescent, or remain for as long as 2 weeks; recurrent cases have been
reported. There have been no other 
associated  symptoms.  Among  the  54  students  reported  initially,  serologies  for
parvovirus B19 were drawn on 13 cases; all were 
negative for IgM. PCR for parvovirus B19 was negative for 10 cases; results are pending
for the remainder. Another 
health-care provider reported that results of nonserological (biopsy) specimens from his
patients were consistent with viral 
exanthem.  Environmental  investigations  at  five  schools  have  not  yet  identified  an
environmental source of the rashes. 
These  investigations  have  included  sampling  for  dust  mite  and  cockroach  allergens,
solvents and cleaners, and fungal or 
bacterial culture growth. Air and surface cultures are still pending. 
Oregon. During February 2002, outbreaks of rashes of acute onset and short duration
occurred among students in 
two Oregon schools. Starting February 4, rashes were reported in 53 children and 11
adults in an elementary school of 
589 students in southwestern Oregon; 54 (84%) were female. The rash, which appeared
on cheeks and arms, was itchy and had 
a  sunburned  appearance  but  no  systemic  symptoms.  A  panel  of  dermatologists  who
examined 28 of the affected 
children reported that the rash resembled fifth disease but that several characteristics
were not compatible with that diagnosis. 
Testing  for  parvovirus  in  two  children  was  negative.  Extensive  questioning  and
environmental inspection did not uncover a source 
of  the  rash.  Beginning  February  21,  rashes  were  reported  by  84  children  and  seven
adults in a middle school of 314 students 
in  northwestern  Oregon;  67  (74%)  affected  persons  were  female.  No  known  links
existed between the two schools. Rashes 
were characterized in a variety of ways, including eczema, and as a sunburned, itchy
rash on face, arms, neck, and back; no 
other symptoms were reported. Tests for parvovirus in six persons were negative. An
environmental evaluation of the school 
found  no  explanation  for  the  rash.  In  both  schools,  rash  improved  in  several  children
when they left school but recurred when 
they returned to school. 
Connecticut. On February 20, the Connecticut Department of Public Health was notified
of nine 
elementary schoolchildren with rashes. On February 21, an additional 16 children were
identified with a similar rash. The children, 
all  fourth-graders,  represented  four  classrooms  in  a  school  of  253  students  and  12
classrooms. The acute rash appeared on 
the trunk and extremities and was characterized by erythema and pruritis. The children
were afebrile and had no other 
symptoms.  The  illness  lasted  24--72  hours.  A  dermatologist  who  examined  three
children attributed the rashes to an allergic reaction 
to an environmental exposure. Rashes were not reported among parents or siblings of
affected children. The local health 
director  and  the  state  Environmental  Epidemiology  Program  are  collaborating  to
identify potential environmental causes. The 
school  was  closed  for  1  day  to  clean  the  classrooms,  check  air-handling  units,  and
replace air filters.
PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE
CDC  is  working  with  state  and  local  health  and  education  agencies  in  these
investigations to determine if affected 
children  within  and  between  schools  have  developed  rash  as  a  result  of  a  common
etiology. CDC is systematically 
compiling information about 1) date of onset and duration of rash; 2) settings of and
circumstances surrounding the rash's 
appearance; 3) the number, age, and sex of affected persons; 4) the appearance and
characteristics of the rash; 5) additional signs 
or  symptoms,  diagnoses,  and  treatments;  and  6)  investigational  methods  used  (e.g.,
interviews or questionnaires, 
biologic  sampling,  and  environmental  sampling).  To  facilitate  the  collection  of
standardized information, CDC has developed 
and  distributed  to  health  departments  a  document  with  suggested  approaches  for
investigating reports of rashes among groups 
of schoolchildren. In addition, CDC requests that dermatologists and other health-care
providers who have examined 
affected children share their clinical observations, diagnoses, and photographs with a
CDC dermatologist
      (bdt1@cdc.gov). 
This  information  will  help  CDC  assess  whether  affected  children  within  and  between
schools developed rash caused by a 
common  etiology.  Local  health  and  school  officials  with  information  about  rashes
among groups of schoolchildren in their 
jurisdiction are asked to report this information to their state health department.

Editorial Note:
 With 53 million young people attending 117,000 schools each school day in the United
States, it is 
expected  that  rashes  from  a  wide  range  of  causes  will  be  observed.  Environmental
factors or infectious agents can cause rashes 
among groups of school-aged children. Rashes caused by infectious agents usually are
preceded or accompanied by symptoms such 
as headache or fever. However, in these reports, none of the children showed signs of
systemic illness, and the rash appeared 
to be self-limiting. 
Potential environmental causes of rashes include biologic contaminants (e.g., bacteria
and fungi), chemical agents 
(e.g.,  cleaning  products  and  pesticide  residues),  physical  agents  (e.g.,  fiberglass),
insects (e.g., biting flies and moths), and 
allergens 
(e.g., dust mites) (2--4). If one of these environmental causes is suspected, appropriate
environmental experts should 
be consulted.    
The  most  commonly  identified  viral  agent  associated  with  rashes  in  school-aged
children is parvovirus B19, which 
causes  erythema  infectiosum  (i.e.,  fifth  disease).  Fifth  disease  is  a  mild  rash  illness
characterized by a "slapped-cheek" rash on the 
face  and  a  lacy  red  rash  on  the  trunk  and  limbs,  which  may  itch;  it  usually  resolves
within 7--10 days. Low-grade fever, malaise, 
or  upper  respiratory  symptoms  usually  precede  the  rash.  Other  manifestations  of
parvovirus B19 infection include arthritis 
and arthralgia (especially in adults), transient crisis of aplastic anemia (in persons with
certain hematologic disorders such 
as  sickle-cell  anemia),  neutropenia,  and  thrombocytopenia.  In  pregnant  women,
parvovirus B19 infection may be 
associated with miscarriage or nonimmune hydrops fetalis 
(1).
Public  health  response  to  rashes  of  unknown  etiology  involves  an  epidemiologic
investigation that includes 
consultation  with  facilities  and  maintenance  staff  familiar  with  the  physical  plant,
examination of the rash by a dermatologist, and, 
when appropriate, collection and analysis of biologic specimens. To date, reports from
states do not document a common cause 
or demonstrate that all children are experiencing the same rash. State and local health
departments, in collaboration with 
CDC,  continue  to  investigate  these  and  other  reports  of  rashes  among  groups  of
schoolchildren.

 Indiana. During October 4--November 2, 2001, rashes appeared among 18 third-grade
students in an elementary school 
of 390 students; one substitute teacher also developed rash. No rashes among family
members were reported. The rash 
most  often  began  on  the  face,  then  spread  to  the  upper  extremities;  most  rashes
occurred on exposed skin. Clinical 
signs---including  reddish  welt-type  itchy  rash  on  face  and  upper  extremities,  swollen
eyes, and smooth pink cheeks---degrees of coloration, 
and  prominence  of  rash  varied  among  the  children.  Diagnoses  in  the  few  children
examined by family physicians varied 
and included contact dermatitis, chemical exposure, impetigo, and poison ivy. Because
parvovirus B19 infection was diagnosed 
in one third-grade student on August 30, 2001, the Indiana State Department of Health
collected serum specimens from 
four  students  with  rashes  to  assess  whether  they  had  parvovirus  B19  infection.  All
specimens tested negative for the presence 
of  IgM  antibodies.  Laboratory  data  analysis,  interviews,  a  building  survey,  and
examination of the children did not identify 
a cause for the rashes.
 Pennsylvania.  The  initial  report  of  rash  occurred  on  January  31,  2002,  among  54
elementary school students who 
had  contact  dermatitis  diagnosed  by  a  local  health-care  provider.  To  date,
approximately 575 cases of rashes have been reported 
to  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of  Health;  58  schools  and  child-care  centers  have
reported cases (range: one--168 cases 
per  facility).  Most  cases  are  in  elementary  and  middle  school  students,  with  female
cases outnumbering males. The rash has 
been  characterized  as  bright-red,  itchy  or  burning,  and  macular,  occasionally  with  an
urticarial or papular component. The 
rash may be evanescent, or remain for as long as 2 weeks; recurrent cases have been
reported. There have been no other 
associated  symptoms.  Among  the  54  students  reported  initially,  serologies  for
parvovirus B19 were drawn on 13 cases; all were 
negative for IgM. PCR for parvovirus B19 was negative for 10 cases; results are pending
for the remainder. Another 
health-care provider reported that results of nonserological (biopsy) specimens from his
patients were consistent with viral 
exanthem.  Environmental  investigations  at  five  schools  have  not  yet  identified  an
environmental source of the rashes. 
These  investigations  have  included  sampling  for  dust  mite  and  cockroach  allergens,
solvents and cleaners, and fungal or 
bacterial culture growth. Air and surface cultures are still pending. 
 Oregon. During February 2002, outbreaks of rashes of acute onset and short duration
occurred among students in 
two Oregon schools. Starting February 4, rashes were reported in 53 children and 11
adults in an elementary school of 
589 students in southwestern Oregon; 54 (84%) were female. The rash, which appeared
on cheeks and arms, was itchy and had 
a  sunburned  appearance  but  no  systemic  symptoms.  A  panel  of  dermatologists  who
examined 28 of the affected 
children reported that the rash resembled fifth disease but that several characteristics
were not compatible with that diagnosis. 
Testing  for  parvovirus  in  two  children  was  negative.  Extensive  questioning  and
environmental inspection did not uncover a source 
of  the  rash.  Beginning  February  21,  rashes  were  reported  by  84  children  and  seven
adults in a middle school of 314 students 
in  northwestern  Oregon;  67  (74%)  affected  persons  were  female.  No  known  links
existed between the two schools. Rashes 
were characterized in a variety of ways, including eczema, and as a sunburned, itchy
rash on face, arms, neck, and back; no 
other symptoms were reported. Tests for parvovirus in six persons were negative. An
environmental evaluation of the school 
found  no  explanation  for  the  rash.  In  both  schools,  rash  improved  in  several  children
when they left school but recurred when 
they returned to school. 
 Connecticut. On February 20, the Connecticut Department of Public Health was notified
of nine 
elementary schoolchildren with rashes. On February 21, an additional 16 children were
identified with a similar rash. The children, 
all  fourth-graders,  represented  four  classrooms  in  a  school  of  253  students  and  12
classrooms. The acute rash appeared on 
the trunk and extremities and was characterized by erythema and pruritis. The children
were afebrile and had no other 
symptoms.  The  illness  lasted  24--72  hours.  A  dermatologist  who  examined  three
children attributed the rashes to an allergic reaction 
to an environmental exposure. Rashes were not reported among parents or siblings of
affected children. The local health 
director  and  the  state  Environmental  Epidemiology  Program  are  collaborating  to
identify potential environmental causes. The 
school  was  closed  for  1  day  to  clean  the  classrooms,  check  air-handling  units,  and
replace air filters.
PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE
CDC  is  working  with  state  and  local  health  and  education  agencies  in  these
investigations to determine if affected 
children  within  and  between  schools  have  developed  rash  as  a  result  of  a  common
etiology. CDC is systematically 
compiling information about 1) date of onset and duration of rash; 2) settings of and
circumstances surrounding the rash's 
appearance; 3) the number, age, and sex of affected persons; 4) the appearance and
characteristics of the rash; 5) additional signs 
or  symptoms,  diagnoses,  and  treatments;  and  6)  investigational  methods  used  (e.g.,
interviews or questionnaires, 
biologic  sampling,  and  environmental  sampling).  To  facilitate  the  collection  of
standardized information, CDC has developed 
and  distributed  to  health  departments  a  document  with  suggested  approaches  for
investigating reports of rashes among groups 
of schoolchildren. In addition, CDC requests that dermatologists and other health-care
providers who have examined 
affected children share their clinical observations, diagnoses, and photographs with a
CDC dermatologist
      (bdt1@cdc.gov). 
This  information  will  help  CDC  assess  whether  affected  children  within  and  between
schools developed rash caused by a 
common  etiology.  Local  health  and  school  officials  with  information  about  rashes
among groups of schoolchildren in their 
jurisdiction are asked to report this information to their state health department.

Editorial Note:
 With 53 million young people attending 117,000 schools each school day in the United
States, it is 
expected  that  rashes  from  a  wide  range  of  causes  will  be  observed.  Environmental
factors or infectious agents can cause rashes 
among groups of school-aged children. Rashes caused by infectious agents usually are
preceded or accompanied by symptoms such 
as headache or fever. However, in these reports, none of the children showed signs of
systemic illness, and the rash appeared 
to be self-limiting. 
Potential environmental causes of rashes include biologic contaminants (e.g., bacteria
and fungi), chemical agents 
(e.g.,  cleaning  products  and  pesticide  residues),  physical  agents  (e.g.,  fiberglass),
insects (e.g., biting flies and moths), and 
allergens 
(e.g., dust mites) (2--4). If one of these environmental causes is suspected, appropriate
environmental experts should 
be consulted.    
The  most  commonly  identified  viral  agent  associated  with  rashes  in  school-aged
children is parvovirus B19, which 
causes  erythema  infectiosum  (i.e.,  fifth  disease).  Fifth  disease  is  a  mild  rash  illness
characterized by a "slapped-cheek" rash on the 
face  and  a  lacy  red  rash  on  the  trunk  and  limbs,  which  may  itch;  it  usually  resolves
within 7--10 days. Low-grade fever, malaise, 
or  upper  respiratory  symptoms  usually  precede  the  rash.  Other  manifestations  of
parvovirus B19 infection include arthritis 
and arthralgia (especially in adults), transient crisis of aplastic anemia (in persons with
certain hematologic disorders such 
as  sickle-cell  anemia),  neutropenia,  and  thrombocytopenia.  In  pregnant  women,
parvovirus B19 infection may be 
associated with miscarriage or nonimmune hydrops fetalis 
(1).
Public  health  response  to  rashes  of  unknown  etiology  involves  an  epidemiologic
investigation that includes 
consultation  with  facilities  and  maintenance  staff  familiar  with  the  physical  plant,
examination of the rash by a dermatologist, and, 
when appropriate, collection and analysis of biologic specimens. To date, reports from
states do not document a common cause 
or demonstrate that all children are experiencing the same rash. State and local health
departments, in collaboration with 
CDC,  continue  to  investigate  these  and  other  reports  of  rashes  among  groups  of
schoolchildren.

associated with miscarriage or nonimmune hydrops fetalis 
(1).
 Public  health  response  to  rashes  of  unknown  etiology  involves  an  epidemiologic
investigation that includes 
consultation  with  facilities  and  maintenance  staff  familiar  with  the  physical  plant,
examination of the rash by a dermatologist, and, 
when appropriate, collection and analysis of biologic specimens. To date, reports from
states do not document a common cause 
or demonstrate that all children are experiencing the same rash. State and local health
departments, in collaboration with 
CDC,  continue  to  investigate  these  and  other  reports  of  rashes  among  groups  of
schoolchildren.
