 Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that
usually  causes  mild,  cold-like  symptoms.  However,  RSV  can  cause  serious  illness  in
infants,  some  young  children,  and  older  adults.   RSV  spreads  through  coughing,
sneezing,  contact  (like  kissing  the  face  of  a  child  who  has  RSV),  and  contaminated
surfaces. Transmission occurs most often during RSV season, which generally starts in
the fall and peaks in the winter in most of the United States. RSV can also cause more
severe  infections  such  as  bronchiolitis  (an  inflammation  of  the  small  airways  in  the
lungs)  and  pneumonia  (an  infection  of  the  lungs).  It  is  the  most  common  cause  of
bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age. Healthy adults and
infants infected with RSV do not usually need to be hospitalized. But some people with
RSV infection, especially older adults and infants younger than 6 months of age, may
need to be hospitalized if they are having trouble breathing or are dehydrated.  In the
most severe cases, a person may require additional oxygen, IV fluids if they can't eat or
drink  enough,  or  intubation  (have  a  breathing  tube  inserted  through  the  mouth  and
down to the airway) with mechanical ventilation (a machine to help a person breathe).
In most of these cases, hospitalization only lasts a few days. Respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV)  usually  causes  mild,  cold-like  symptoms  in  most  people,  but  it  is  the  leading
cause of infant hospitalization in the U.S. Languages Language Assistance Languages
