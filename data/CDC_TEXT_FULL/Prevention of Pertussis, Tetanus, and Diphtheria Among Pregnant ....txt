 In 2005, two tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap)
vaccines were licensed 
and recommended for use in adults and adolescents in the United States: 
ADACEL® (sanofi pasteur, Swiftwater, 
Pennsylvania), which is licensed for use in persons aged 11--64 years, and 
BOOSTRIX® (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, 
Belgium), which is licensed for use in persons aged 10--18 years. Both Tdap vaccines
are licensed for single-dose use to add 
protection  against  pertussis  and  to  replace  the  next  dose  of  tetanus  and  diphtheria
toxoids vaccine (Td). Available evidence does 
not  address  the  safety  of  Tdap  for  pregnant  women,  their  fetuses,  or  pregnancy
outcomes sufficiently. Available data also do 
not  indicate  whether  Tdap-induced  transplacental  maternal  antibodies  provide  early
protection against pertussis to infants 
or  interfere  with  an  infant's  immune  responses  to  routinely  administered  pediatric
vaccines. Until additional information 
is  available,  CDC's  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization  Practices  recommends  that
pregnant women who were not 
vaccinated previously with Tdap: 1) receive Tdap in the immediate postpartum period
before discharge from hospital or birthing 
center, 2) may receive Tdap at an interval as short as 2 years since the most recent Td
vaccine, 3) receive Td during pregnancy 
for  tetanus  and  diphtheria  protection  when  indicated,  or  4)  defer  the  Td  vaccine
indicated during pregnancy to substitute 
Tdap  vaccine  in  the  immediate  postpartum  period  if  the  woman  is  likely  to  have
sufficient protection against tetanus 
and  diphtheria.  Although  pregnancy  is  not  a  contraindication  for  receiving  Tdap
vaccine, health-care providers should weigh 
the  theoretical  risks  and  benefits  before  choosing  to  administer  Tdap  vaccine  to  a
pregnant woman. This report 1) describes 
the  clinical  features  of  pertussis,  tetanus,  and  diphtheria  among  pregnant  and
postpartum women and their infants, 2) 
reviews available evidence of pertussis vaccination during pregnancy as a strategy to
prevent infant pertussis, 3) summarizes 
Tdap vaccination policy in the United States, and 4) presents recommendations for use
of Td and Tdap vaccines among 
pregnant and postpartum women.
 Pertussis is an acute and prolonged infectious cough illness caused by 
Bordetella pertussis, a fastidious 
gram-negative  coccobacillus.  Pertussis  results  in  substantial  morbidity  among  adults
and adolescents whose immunity to past 
childhood  vaccination  or  B.  pertussis  infection  might  have  waned  and  who  have  not
received booster immunization for pertussis 
with 
adult tetanus, reduced diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine 
(1,2). In 2004, women aged 15--39 
years accounted for 97% of all live births in the United States 
(3). During 2000--2006, a total of 103,940 cases of pertussis 
were  reported  to  CDC's  National  Notifiable  Diseases  Surveillance  System  (NNDSS);
27,759 (27%) of these cases occurred 
among  persons  aged  15--39  years  (CDC,  unpublished  data,  2007).  Parents  with
pertussis, including new mothers, are the 
identified source of B. pertussis infection in 
>25% of pertussis cases in early infancy, when rates for complications and fatalities 
are  highest  (4--8).  Infants  aged  <12  months  accounted  for  145  (93%)  of  156
pertussis-related deaths reported to CDC for 
2000--2006  (CDC,  unpublished  data,  2007).  Decennial  booster  vaccination  with  adult
tetanus toxoid and reduced diphtheria 
toxoid  (Td)  vaccine  has  been  largely  responsible  for  reducing  the  average  annual
number of tetanus and respiratory diphtheria 
cases reported during 2000--2006 to 31 and less than one, respectively. In contrast, the
average annual 
number of pertussis cases was 14,849 during the same period 
(9--15; CDC, unpublished data, 2007).
 In 2005, two Tdap vaccines were licensed in the United States: 
ADACEL® (sanofi pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) for 
use in persons aged 11--64 years (16) and 
BOOSTRIX® (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) for persons aged 
10--18 years (17) (Table 1). Both vaccines are 
licensed for single-dose administration. Acellular pertussis vaccines formulated 
with  tetanus  and  diphtheria  toxoids  also  are  available  for  adults  and  adolescents  in
other countries, including an increasing 
number  of  European  countries  (e.g.,  France,  Austria,  and  Germany),  Canada,  and
Australia 
(18--20).  No  vaccine  containing  acellular  pertussis  antigens  without  tetanus  and
diphtheria toxoids is available in the United States.
 Vaccinating adults and adolescents using Tdap reduces the burden of pertussis among
vaccine recipients and might 
prevent transmission of B. pertussis to infants 
(1,2). Statements and recommendations by CDC's Advisory Committee 
for Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding use of Tdap by adults, including health-care
personnel, and adolescents 
(Table  2)  provide  background  information  on  pertussis  and  extensive  discussion
regarding the safety and immunogenicity of Tdap 
in prelicensure trials. These recommendations encourage 
adult and adolescent women of childbearing age to receive Tdap at 
a  routine  health  assessment  before  conception  to  prevent  the  morbidity  of  pertussis
that could occur during pregnancy 
and encourage use of Tdap among adults and adolescents who anticipate contact with
an infant aged <12 months both 
for personal protection and to reduce the risk for transmitting 
B. pertussis to the infants 
(1,2).
 In 2006, ACIP recommended routine administration of Tdap for postpartum women who
were not vaccinated 
previously with Tdap to provide personal protection and reduce the risk for transmitting
pertussis to their infants 
(1,2)  .  After  careful  consideration,  in  June  2006,  ACIP  voted  to  reaffirm  its
recommendation for use of Td in pregnant women who have 
urgent  indication  for  tetanus  toxoid  or  diphtheria  toxoid  vaccination  to  prevent
maternal or neonatal tetanus, or to 
prevent diphtheria. Pregnant women not vaccinated previously with Tdap will receive a
measure of protection against pertussis 
by ensuring that children in the household are up-to-date with recommended doses of
pediatric diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP)* 
(21--23) and that adult and adolescent household contacts have received a dose 
of Tdap (Table 2) (1,2). Health-care providers can monitor pregnant women who have
not received a dose of Tdap for 
exposures to pertussis or to respiratory illness consistent with pertussis, and they can
administer antimicrobials for 
postexposure  prophylaxis  or  treatment  of  pertussis,  if  needed,  to  reduce  the  risk  for
transmitting pertussis to their infants.
 This report provides the background and rationale for routine administration of Tdap in
postpartum women who were 
not vaccinated previously with Tdap and for maintaining the previous recommendation
for use of Td in pregnant women 
if  indicated.  The  safety  and  efficacy  of  using  Tdap  in  pregnant  women  has  not  been
demonstrated, and Tdap is 
not  recommended  for  use  in  pregnant  women  in  any  country.  No  evidence  exists  of
excess morbidity or any fatality 
among  pregnant  women  ascribed  to  pertussis.  No  evidence  exists  demonstrating
whether
Tdap  in  pregnant  women  harms  the  fetus  or  increases  risk  for  adverse  pregnancy
outcomes,
transplacental  antibody  induced  by  Tdap  administered  during  pregnancy  will  protect
infants against pertussis, or
Tdap-induced  transplacental  maternal  antibody  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  an
infant's protective immune 
response  to  later-administered  routine  pediatric  DTaP  or  to  conjugate  vaccines
containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid.
This report discusses certain situations in which health-care providers might choose to
administer Tdap to a 
pregnant woman. Health-care providers should weigh the theoretical risks and benefits
before choosing to administer Tdap vaccine to 
a pregnant woman. 
Methods 
During  June  2006,  ACIP  evaluated  the  limited  evidence  available  concerning  safety,
immunogenicity, and 
pregnancy  outcomes  after  administration  of  Tdap;  evidence  from  historic  use  of
pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria vaccines in 
pregnant women; and the potential effects of transplacental maternal antibody on the
infant's immune response to active 
immunization  with  pediatric  diphtheria  and  tetanus  toxoids  and  whole-cell  pertussis
(DTP) or DTaP vaccines, or to conjugate 
vaccines  containing  tetanus  toxoid  or  diphtheria  toxoid.  The  evaluation  included  a
synthesis of information from scientific 
literature  published  in  English,  unpublished  sources  of  information,  consultations,
analyses, and extensive discussion by an 
ACIP  working  group†  during  2005--2006.  The  working  group  comprised  persons  with
expertise in pertussis, tetanus, 
and  diphtheria;  obstetrics  and  gynecology;  pediatrics,  family  practice,  internal
medicine, immunology, public health, and 
vaccine regulation; and liaison members from partner 
organizations. 
The workgroup considered multiple diverse views on the adequacy of evidence needed
to form a recommendation for use 
of Tdap in pregnant and postpartum women. A minority view held that available data
from nonpregnant women and men, 
and  experience  with  the  use  of  Td  in  pregnant  women  to  prevent  neonatal  and
maternal tetanus, were sufficient to support 
a recommendation for the safe use of Tdap in pregnant women for individual protection
from pertussis. The 
majority view, while acknowledging the desirability of preventing pertussis in pregnant
women and the substantial body of 
information  demonstrating  the  usefulness  of  Td  to  prevent  maternal  and  neonatal
tetanus, held that the evidence was 
insufficient at this time to support a recommendation for 
routine administration of Tdap in pregnant women. The specific issues for 
pertussis  differ  from  those  for  tetanus  and  diphtheria.  Important  among  these  is  the
limited understanding of immunity and 
correlates of protection for pertussis. In 
addition, data supporting the safety of vaccinating pregnant women with Tdap to 
prevent  pertussis  are  scarce  for  women,  their  fetuses,  and  pregnancy  outcomes.
Whether transplacental maternal antibody exerts 
an  inhibitory  or  other  effect  on  the  infant-protective  immune  response  to  active
immunization with pediatric DTaP or 
conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid has not been studied.
Protection against infant pertussis 
through  Tdap-induced  transplacental  maternal  antibody  has  not  been  demonstrated.
Until additional information is available, 
the majority view of the working group held that Tdap administered to women in the
immediate postpartum period, in 
addition  to  ensuring  pertussis  vaccination  of  close  contacts,  would  likely  provide  a
measure of protection for mother and infant.
Pertussis 
B. pertussis, the organism that causes 
pertussis, elaborates multiple toxins, including tracheal cytotoxin, which damages 
the respiratory epithelial tissue in vitro 
(24), and pertussis toxin, which has systemic effects (e.g., promoting lymphocytosis) 
(25). Illnesses caused by other species of Bordetella are not considered preventable by
available pertussis vaccines 
(26,27).
Clinical Features 
B.  pertussis  infections  and  reinfections  among  adults  and  adolescents  can  be
asymptomatic or range from a mild 
cough illness to the severe, prolonged cough illness of classic pertussis 
(28). The clinical presentation of pertussis can be similar 
to that for respiratory illness caused by B. parapertussis, 
B. bronchiseptica, B. holmseii, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae, Chlamydia (Chlamydophila) pneumoniae, and multiple viral agents (e.g.,
adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, 
human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus). The incubation
period for pertussis typically is 7--10 
days (range: 5--21 days) (29,30).
Classic  pertussis  is  characterized  by  three  phases:  catarrhal,  paroxysmal,  and
convalescent 
(28,29). The catarrhal phase lasts 1--2 weeks and consists of a watery nasal discharge
and frequent cough, frequent sneezing, and injection of the 
conjunctiva,  often  with  lacrimation.  The  cough  typically  suggests  tracheal  irritation
(e.g., a tickle in the throat) and is short, sharp, 
hacking,  and  isolated  (as  distinguished  from  paroxysmal).  The  cough  is  equally
persistent during day and night and rarely croupy 
or  hoarse.  Fever  is  uncommon  during  any  phase  unless  the  illness  is  complicated  by
secondary infection or coinfection 
(28).  The  paroxysmal  phase  lasts  2--6  weeks.  The  patient  has  intermittent  periods  of
intense coughing (paroxysms) alternating 
with periods of appearing relatively well with a normal respiratory rate. The paroxysms
are characterized by spasms of 
coughing, choking, posttussive vomiting, and inspiratory whoop 
(29,31). Adults experience greater severity 
of  illness  than  adolescents,  including  cough-related  incontinence  in  28%  of  cases  in
women; in up to 5% of cases, adults and adolescents experience 
one 
or more rib fracture, syncope, or pneumonia, or they require hospitalizations 
(1,2,31,32). Approximately one third of 
adults and adolescents lose weight during the illness 
(31,33). Anecdotal reports of pneumothorax, seizures, stroke, and 
other complications have been summarized previously 
(1,34). The convalescent phase of pertussis typically lasts 2--6 weeks 
(35). Symptoms can persist for >6 months 
(1,2). Factors that can lessen the severity of 
B. pertussis infection include 
residual  immunity  from  previous  infection  or  vaccination  and  use  of  macrolide
antimicrobials in the catarrhal (early) phase of 
the illness (36).
Adults and adolescents with pertussis make repeated medical visits and miss work and
school. During 1998--2000 
in Massachusetts, among 936 adults and 1,679 adolescents 
reported with confirmed pertussis, the median number of 
medical visits was two (range: 0--15) (31). Among 203 adults and 314 adolescents with
confirmed pertussis who 
were interviewed during 2001--2003, 158 (78%) adults were 
employed. Of these employed adults, 123 (78%) missed work 
(mean:  9.8  days;  range:  0.1--180  days);  261  of  the  314  (83%)  adolescents  missed
school (mean: 5.5 days; range: 0.4--32 
days). Among primary caregivers for adolescents, 136 of 
314 (43%) missed work (mean: 2.4 days; range: 0.1--25 days); a 
second caregiver in 53 families also missed work (mean: 1.8 days; range: 0.1--11 days) 
(31).
Pertussis is transmitted from person to person via large respiratory droplets generated
by coughing or sneezing; 
early reports suggested that B. pertussis can be recovered from dried mucus for up to 3
days 
(28,30). Pertussis is highly 
infectious, with attack rates among exposed, nonimmune household contacts as high as
80%--90% 
(29,37,38). The most infectious periods are the catarrhal and early paroxysmal phases 
(28). Untreated patients, particularly infants, remain infectious for 
6 weeks or longer (29). Among older children and adults with previous vaccination or
infection, the infectious period typically 
is <21 days (29).
In a Canadian study conducted in 1999, a source was identified in 60%--70% of adults
and adolescents with 
pertussis. Among adults aged 18--39 years, the source was a person in the household in
25%--44% of cases or at work or school 
in 17%--25% of cases. Among adolescents aged 12--17 years, the source was a person
in the household in 9% of cases and 
a friend or person at school or work in 51% of cases 
(39).
Pertussis During Pregnancy 
Case reports suggest that the morbidity of pertussis is not increased among pregnant
women compared with 
nonpregnant  women.  In  a  general  medical  practice  during  1979--1980,  four  pregnant
women had onset of cough during the 12th, 
14th, 14th, and 36th week of gestation and cough that lasted 36, 6, 8, and 6 weeks,
respectively; two women had vomiting 
after  coughing  and  worsening  cough  paroxysms  at  night;  and  one  woman  developed
hemoptysis and subconjunctival 
hemorrhage after repeated and forceful coughing paroxysms 
(40). A 1993 case report described a pregnant woman who was hospitalized 
6 days before delivery for severe paroxysms and posttussive emesis 
(41). In a series of 32 women who had pertussis 
during pregnancy or at term, the illness was characterized as "a very tiresome disease";
no obstetric complication was reported, and 
no  infant  was  premature  (42).  No  pertussis-related  deaths  have  been  reported  in
pregnant women. The source of pertussis 
in infected pregnant women has not been examined systematically. 
Reports  of  fetal  morbidity  among  pregnant  women  with  pertussis  are  rare,  and  no
causal relationship with abnormal 
fetal  development,  fetal  morbidity,  or  adverse  outcome  of  pregnancy  has  been
confirmed. One fetus of a mother who had 
severe paroxysmal coughing early in pregnancy had an extradural hematoma that was
identified by ultrasonography and 
magnetic  resonance  at  31  weeks'  gestation;  studies  had  been  normal  at  12  and  22
weeks' gestation 
(43).  Another  fetus  of  a  mother  who  had  pertussis  during  the  first  trimester  had
prenatal diagnosis of laryngotracheal obstruction 
(44).
Infantile Pertussis 
Infants  aged  <12  months  typically  have  the  most  severe  pertussis,  often  requiring
hospitalization for respiratory or 
other complications (Table 3) (8,45--49). The risk for pertussis death or severe pertussis
is highest among infants in the first 
6 months of life and remains elevated until infants have received 
1--2 doses of pediatric DTaP 
(8,50,51). During 2000--2006, the average annual incidence of pertussis among infants
aged 
<6 months was 111 cases per 100,000 population; for 
infants  aged  6--11  months,  incidence  was  19  cases  per  100,000  population  (CDC,
unpublished data, 2007).
Complications and deaths from infant pertussis have been characterized by necrotizing
bronchiolitis 
(52)  and  high  rates  of  primary  or  secondary  pneumonia  and/or  coinfection  with
bacterial and viral pathogens 
(8,28,47,53). Since 1993, pulmonary 
hypertension has been increasingly recognized among fatal infant cases 
(47,52,54--58). The majority of all infant deaths 
have occurred among unvaccinated infants 
(47,53,58; CDC, unpublished data, 2007). Hispanic infants and infants born 
at  estimated  gestational  age  <37  weeks  or  with  low  birth  weight  have  comprised  a
larger proportion of pertussis deaths 
than would have been expected on the basis of population estimates 
(47,53,58). Compared with the prevaccine era, during 
2000--2006, the proportion of reported pertussis deaths among infants aged <3 months
increased from 37% to 83% 
(Figure 1) (38,47; CDC, unpublished data, 2007).
Since  the  1970s,  parents,  especially  mothers,  have  been  identified  as  the  most
important source of infant pertussis; 
however, a source has been identified in only 30%--60% of cases investigated 
(5--7,34,38,42,48,59--68). One or more 
household contact with pertussis is the source of pertussis in 
approximately  75%  of  cases  among  infants  aged  <6  months  for  whom  the  source  is
identified. A parent is implicated in approximately 25% of cases in infants, including the
mother in 16%--19% 
of cases. A sibling is implicated as the source of transmission in <10% of cases 
(5,7,34).
Mathematical modeling evaluating different vaccine strategies for the United States has
suggested that pertussis 
vaccination  of  90%  of  household  contacts  (children,  adolescents,  and  adults)  of
newborns, in addition to pertussis vaccination of 75% 
of  adolescents  generally  in  the  population,  might  prevent  approximately  75%  of
pertussis cases among infants aged 0--23 
months (69). Another model estimated vaccination of 
both parents of an infant before discharge from the hospital could prevent 38% 
of  infant  cases  and  deaths  (70).  However,  the  efficacy  of  these  strategies  in  practice
has not been evaluated.
Disease Burden 
Although pertussis is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States 
(71), data on the pregnancy status of women 
with  pertussis  have  not  been  collected.  However,  the  burden  of  pertussis  among
pregnant women is likely to be similar to 
the  burden  among  other  adults  in  the  population.  Pertussis  reports  typically
demonstrate increases in 
activity  every  3--4  years  (72);  aside  from  these  cycles  of  activity,  the  number  of
reported cases of pertussis in the United States has increased gradually 
since 1976. During 2004--2005, more than 25,000 cases were reported per year 
(Figure  2).  During  2006,  a  total  of  15,632  pertussis  cases  were  reported,  including
2,029 (13%) cases among infants, 5,045 (32%) cases among children aged 
1--14  years,  5,148  (33%)  cases  among  persons  aged  15--39  years,  and  3,331  (21%)
cases among adults aged
>40  years.  A  total  of  40  pertussis-related  deaths  were  reported  in  2005  and  16  in
2006; 39 (98%) of these deaths occurred among infants in 2005 
and 14 (88%) in 2006 (CDC unpublished data, 2007). Prospective and serologic studies
suggest that pertussis infection 
and reinfection are underrecognized among adults and adolescents 
(29,73--75). The pertussis burden is believed to be 
substantially  more  than  the  number  of  reported  cases;  approximately  600,000  cases
are estimated to occur annually just among 
adults (1,34,76).
Transmission in Obstetric and Neonatal Health-Care Settings
Health-care personnel can transmit B. 
pertussis in health-care settings if pertussis has not been considered by hospital 
staff (1,77,78). Outbreaks have been documented in prenatal and postnatal clinics 
(79,80), maternity wards 
(51,62,81--83), neonatal nurseries, and neonatal intensive-care services 
(62,81,84--90). Ongoing transmission is facilitated by delay 
in isolation and treatment of patients and in prophylaxis of contacts and by inconsistent
use of face or nose and 
mouth  protection  (1,85,87,91).  Unprotected  exposures  to  pertussis  in  health-care
settings can result in labor-intensive, 
disruptive,  and  costly  investigations  and  control  measures,  particularly  when  the
number of contacts is substantial 
(80,92).  Pertussis  transmitted  to  health-care  personnel  or  patients  can  result  in
substantial morbidity (and on rare occasions in fatal 
disease) among hospitalized infants 
(79,80,85--88,93,94).
Health-care  personnel  who  have  not  been  vaccinated  with  Tdap  (Table  2)  can  be  an
important source of pertussis 
and pertussis outbreaks in obstetric and neonatal settings. A wide range of health-care
disciplines have been implicated, 
including physicians, resident physicians, and students 
(80,82, 85,95); nurses and nurse midwives 
(51,81,85,87,96--98); and aides, medical assistants, and educators 
(1,51,78,79,81,82, 85,87). Pregnant and postpartum women with unrecognized 
pertussis and visitors to prenatal, obstetric, and neonatal units, including fathers and
other close relatives, pose a substantial risk 
for transmission to infants, pregnant women, and health-care personnel and have been
associated with outbreaks in these 
settings  (6,41,62,80,81,84--86,93,98).  Early  recognition  and  treatment  of  pertussis  in
pregnant and postpartum women 
and  prophylaxis  of  household  contacts  who  visit  health-care  settings  is  critical  to
prevent continuing transmission. 
Antimicrobial 
treatment for women who have pertussis near term or at delivery and prophylaxis for
their newborns and household contacts 
are effective in preventing further transmission 
(42,99).
Diagnosis 
The  diagnosis  of  pertussis  is  complicated  by  the  limitations  of  currently  available
diagnostic tests. The only 
pertussis diagnostic tests that are accepted to confirm a case for purposes of national
reporting are culture and polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) (when the clinical case definition also is met) 
(100; Box 1). Multiple factors affect the sensitivity, 
specificity, and interpretation of diagnostic tests for pertussis 
(101,102).
Culture 
Culture  to  isolate  B.  pertussis  is  essential  for  identifying  the  organism  early  in  the
course of disease 
(103) and for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, if indicated. Isolation of 
B. pertussis by culture is 100% specific; for optimal yield, 
culture requires specimens that contain nasopharyngeal cells obtained by aspirate or
nasopharyngeal swab and special medium 
for growth. The sensitivity of culture early in pertussis varies (range: 30%--60%) 
(103--105). Outside of infancy, the yield 
of B. pertussis declines to 1%--3% in specimens taken in the third week of cough illness
or later, after starting 
antimicrobial treatment, or in a patient who was vaccinated previously 
(106,107). B. pertussis can be isolated in culture as early as 72 hours 
after plating but requires 1--2 weeks before a result can 
definitively be called negative (108).
Polymerase Chain Reaction 
DNA amplification (e.g., PCR) to detect B. pertussis has increased sensitivity and more
rapid turnaround time 
(109--111).  When  symptoms  of  classic  pertussis  are  present  (e.g.,  >2  weeks  of
paroxysmal cough), PCR can be two to three times 
more likely than culture to detect B. pertussis in a known positive sample 
(101,103,112,113). As with culture, the PCR result 
is  affected  by  the  technique  used  to  collect  the  specimen;  a  poorly  taken
nasopharyngeal swab is more likely to be negative 
by  both  culture  and  PCR.  PCR  is  less  affected  than  culture  by  antimicrobial  therapy
because the organism does not need to 
be viable for the test to be positive. Adults and adolescents who have specimens taken
later in the course of illness, who 
have  started  antibiotic  treatment,  or  who  were  vaccinated  previously  tend  to  have
PCR-positive, culture-negative test 
results (103,114).
Although PCR testing for pertussis has been available for nearly 20 years 
(115), no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--licensed PCR test kit is available.
The analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and quality control of PCR-based
B. pertussis tests vary widely among laboratories. PCR assays used by the majority of
laboratories amplify a single gene 
sequence,  typically  within  the  insertion  sequence  IS481.  Both  false-positive  and
false-negative results have been reported with these 
assays; reported outbreaks of respiratory illness mistakenly attributed to pertussis have
resulted in unnecessary 
investigation and treatment, and unnecessary chemoprophylaxis of contacts 
(112,116--119). Using more than one genetic 
target and consensus interpretation criteria for PCR diagnosis of pertussis 
(120,121) has been suggested as a way to provide increased assurance 
of specificity (122) and to allow discrimination between Bordetella species.
Other Diagnostic Tests 
Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests provide rapid 
results (within hours), but sensitivity (10%--50%) is less than 
with culture (123). With use of monoclonal reagents, the specificity of DFA should be
>90%. However, interpretation of the test 
is subjective, and, when interpreted by an inexperienced microbiologist, the specificity
can be lower 
(110).  Diagnosis  of  pertussis  by  serology  requires  a  substantial  change  in  titer  for
pertussis antigens (typically fourfold) from acute (<2 weeks after 
cough  onset)  to  convalescent  sera  (>4  weeks  after  the  acute  sample).  The  results
typically become available too late in the course 
of the illness to be useful clinically. Single-sample serologic tests for antipertussis toxin
(anti-PT) IgG have been developed 
for  research  purposes;  sera  must  be  collected  at  least  2  weeks  after  the  onset  of
symptoms 
(124).  Pertussis  serology  assays  using  commercial  reagents  are  available,  but  these
assays are not validated clinically and do not differentiate between recent 
and remote infection and vaccination 
(125,126). No serologic assay is licensed by FDA for routine diagnostic use in the 
United States.
Postexposure Prophylaxis and Treatment 
A macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin) 
is the preferred antimicrobial for postexposure prophylaxis 
and  treatment  of  pertussis  (127).  Antimicrobial  treatment  administered  in  the  early
(catarrhal) phase of the illness can modify 
the severity of the symptoms (36,128,129). An antimicrobial generally does not modify
the severity or the course of the 
illness after paroxysmal cough is established but is used to eliminate 
B. pertussis and halt transmission 
(36,127--129). Without use of an effective antimicrobial, 
B. pertussis can be recovered for 6 weeks or longer from infant patients and for 21 days
or 
longer from adult and adolescent patients. Detailed 
recommendations, indications, and schedules for postexposure 
antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment of pertussis have been published previously 
(127).
Pregnant women with pertussis near term and other household contacts with pertussis
are an important source of 
pertussis for newborn infants 
(6,41,42,62,64,99). Antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis are effective in preventing
transmission 
of pertussis to neonates. A macrolide is administered to a woman with pertussis that is
acquired late in pregnancy or 
shortly before delivery, her household contacts, and the neonate. Early recognition of
pertussis in a pregnant woman is necessary 
to ensure the effectiveness of this approach 
(42,99).
Pregnancy  is  not  a  contraindication  for  use  of  erythromycin,  azithromycin,  or
clarithromycin. Erythromycin 
and azithromycin are listed as FDA Category B drugs, and clarithromycin is listed as a
Category C drug 
(130--132).  Macrolides  can  interact  with  a  variety  of  other  therapeutic  agents,
precluding concurrent use. Although macrolides can 
have gastrointestional side effects (e.g., nausea and vomiting), 
serious side effects (e.g., hepatic dysfunction or 
pseudomembranous  colitis)  are  rare  (127).  Infants  aged  <1  month  who  receive
erythromycin are at increased risk for infantile hypertrophic 
pyloric stenosis (83,133--136). For this reason, and because azithromycin is associated
with fewer adverse effects than 
erythromycin,  azithromycin  is  the  preferred  antimicrobial  for  prophylaxis  of  neonates
exposed to pertussis 
(127). Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has been reported in two preterm infants
who received azithromycin for postexposure prophylaxis 
(137); however, a causal association between infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and
azithromycin has not been established.
Immunity to Pertussis 
The  mechanisms  of  protection  against  pertussis  are  incompletely  understood.  On  the
basis of studies in animals 
and humans, both humoral and cellular immunity are believed to play a complementary
role 
(138--143). The protection that results from 
B.  pertussis  infection  or  pertussis  vaccines  persists  for  an  estimated  5--10  years  or
more. Protection wanes 
over time, leaving persons susceptible to infection or reinfection 
(4,75,144--150).
Humoral Immunity to Pertussis Vaccine Antigens 
Immune responses to B. pertussis can be directed variably against a range of pertussis
toxins and antigens. No level 
of  antibody,  presence  of  specific  antibodies,  or  antibody  profile  has  been  accepted
universally as a quantifiable serologic 
measure  of  protection  (139,141,151--158).  Studies  of  parenterally  administered
immune globulins for postexposure 
prophylaxis (159,160) or for treatment of pertussis 
(28,161--165) report mixed results and do not clarify the role of passive antibodies 
in  prevention  or  treatment  of  pertussis.  By  extrapolation,  these  results  do  not  help
predict the role of transplacental 
maternal antibodies in infant protection. 
Pertussis  toxin  (PT),  previously  called  lymphocytosis  promoting  factor  (LPF),  is
considered one of the most important of 
a  range  of  clinically  relevant  toxins  and  virulence  factors  of  B.  pertussis  (including
pertactin or 69-kDa protein [PRN], 
fimbriae types 2 and 3 [FIM], filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA]) 
(140,142,152,157,166--169). Detoxified PT is a component of 
all  pertussis  vaccines.  The  preventive  efficacy  of  a  pediatric  DTaP  vaccine  containing
detoxified PT as the only 
immunizing  antigen  was  71%  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI]  =  63%--78%)  against
classical pertussis 
(170).  However,  the  contribution  to  protection  by  anti-PT  varied  in  analyses  of  the
humoral immune responses to specific vaccine antigens when evaluated in 
two  household  studies.  Elevated  concentrations  of  anti-PRN  and  anti-FIM  were
associated most closely with protection in 
these (152,157) and other studies 
(171). Evidence of added protection from anti-FHA has been mixed 
(152,156,157,172,173).
Cellular Immunity to Pertussis Vaccine Antigens 
Cell-mediated immune mechanisms clear 
B. pertussis from within macrophages and other cells 
(52,139,174--177). In addition to humoral immune responses, B. pertussis antigens in
acellular pertussis vaccines induce cell-mediated 
immune responses (178) after primary immunization with pediatric DTaP among infants
(158,179), after booster vaccination among 
children  (140,141,149),  and  after  booster  vaccination  with  reduced  pertussis  antigen
content vaccines among 
adolescents (178,180--183) and adults 
(183,184). Protection is maintained among children whose antibody levels drop 
below the level of detection over time (185) suggesting that cell-mediated immunity is
an important component of protection. 
Cell-mediated  immune  responses  remain  measurable  substantially  longer  than
antibodies to the same antigens, particularly PT, and the 
cell-mediated immune responses to initial doses of pertussis vaccines are believed to
correlate better with long-term immunity 
than antibody responses 
(140,141,149,158,178,180,181,183,185).
Prevalence of Pertussis-Specific Antibodies: Pregnant Women and their Infants
Although the importance of antipertussis activity in sera relative to protection remains
uncertain, studies conducted 
since the 1930s have determined the prevalence of antipertussis activity in sera from
mothers and infants using 
multiple assays (Tables 4--8) 
(37,154,186--199).  Detectable  pertussis-specific  antibodies  have  been  identified  in
unvaccinated 
women without a history of pertussis 
(28,187,190,192), women with a past history of pertussis 
(28,187,190,192),  women  who  likely  received  whole-cell  pertussis  vaccine  during
childhood 
(195,196,198--200), and women with a recent history of 
pertussis  (99).  With  the  exception  of  women  with  recent  pertussis,  the  majority  of
pregnant women have low geometric 
mean  concentrations  (GMCs)  of  anti-PT  and  antibodies  to  other  pertussis  antigens
(Tables 4--8) 
(159),  consistent  with  generally  low  concentrations  of  antipertussis  antibodies  among
adults surveyed in the general population 
(147,201--205). GMCs of pertussis-specific antibodies among pregnant women typically
have been low regardless of age, as demonstrated in 
a predominantly (80%) African-American population reported in 2005 
(199). A 2006 study of pregnant Hispanics found 
lower GMCs among adolescents than among women aged >20 years (198).
The efficiency of maternal-fetal transfer of IgG antibodies to pertussis-specific antigens
varies; the majority of 
investigators  report  similar  antigen-specific  concentrations  in  cord  or  neonatal  infant
sera and in maternal sera measured late in 
pregnancy or at delivery (195--200), but higher concentrations in cord or neonatal sera
than in maternal sera have been reported, 
which might indicate active transport in certain settings (Tables 7 and 
8) 
(195,197,199). In a 2005 survey of mothers and 
their infants, anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN were detected in maternal sera from 35%,
95%, and 80% of women, 
respectively, and in cord sera from 45%, 93%, and 81% of infants, respectively 
(199). Among 17 infants studied in 1990, the half-life 
of transplacental maternal antibody was 36.3 days for anti-PT, 40.3 days for anti-FHA,
and 55.0 days for pertussis 
agglutinins  (195).  Transplacental  maternal  antibody  was  not  detectable  or  was
negligible in the majority of infants by age 6--8 
weeks (195,197) or by age 4 months 
(195), consistent with the results of early studies 
(186). By contrast, in a study of 23 unvaccinated Swedish infants whose mothers had
pertussis late in pregnancy, five infants had neutralizing antibody 
detectable as long as 14 months and detectable anti-PT for 5 months or longer 
(99).
Kinetics of Pertussis Booster Vaccination in Nonpregnant 
Adults and Adolescents 
The majority of adults and adolescents have had exposure to 
B. pertussis, pertussis antigen--containing vaccines, or both, 
and they will have a booster response to vaccination with pertussis antigens 
(184,206). A rise in antibodies is measurable by 7 
days after vaccination (207), and GMCs reach near-peak levels by 2 weeks after booster
vaccination 
(207--210).  Antibody  concentrations  decline  rapidly  in  the  first  few  months  following
vaccination, after which the rate of decline 
slows (157,181,209,211). Anti-PT levels decline more rapidly than anti-PRN or anti-FHA
levels. Among adults who received 
a booster dose of an acellular pertussis vaccine without tetanus or diphtheria toxoids,
concentrations of IgG anti-PT and 
anti-PRN  declined  58%  and  39%,  respectively,  after  6  months.  By  18  months  after
vaccination, concentrations declined 73% 
and 56%, respectively (209).
Vaccinating Pregnant Women against Pertussis 
Tdap 
No  prelicensure  studies  were  conducted  with  Tdap  in  pregnant  women.  In  2005,  to
increase understanding of the safety 
of Tdap in relationship to pregnancy, both Tdap manufacturers established registries to
solicit voluntary reports of 
pregnant women who received Tdap during pregnancy or who received Tdap and were
determined subsequently to be 
pregnant  (212,213).  The  main  utility  of  the  registries  is  to  signal  the  possibility  and
nature of any risk 
(214). All women who are vaccinated with Tdap at any time during pregnancy should be
reported to the registry as early as possible during 
the pregnancy. Information from pregnancy registries differs from surveillance reports,
which are used to evaluate 
outcomes 
among women when an adverse outcome of pregnancy already might have occurred
(e.g., an infant born with a birth 
defect) (214).
As  of  December  31,  2007,  GlaxoSmithKline  had  received  five  reports  of  pregnancy
exposure to 
BOOSTRIX®  within  28  days  before  conception  or  during  any  trimester  of  pregnancy,
including two in the first trimester, one in the second 
trimester,  and  two  during  an  unknown  trimester.  Among  the  two  first-trimester
exposures, one subject delivered a normal infant at 
33 weeks' gestation, and one subject was lost to 
follow-up. Of the remaining exposures, information on the outcome of 
two  pregnancies  was  not  yet  available,  and  one  subject  was  lost  to  follow-up
(GlaxoSmithKline, unreported data, 2008).
As of November 23, 2007, sanofi pasteur had received 107 spontaneous reports and 47
reports from 
postlicensing surveillance studies of exposure to 
ADACEL® during pregnancy. For these 154 reports, pregnancy outcomes were 68 
live  infants  (including  64  term  deliveries  [one  with  a  congenital  anomaly]  and  four
preterm deliveries [one at 28 weeks 
after  complications  of  pregnancy,  labor,  and  delivery;  two  at  35  weeks  for
preeclampsia; and one at 35 weeks for 
breech  presentation]);  three  spontaneous  abortions  (at  9,  51,  and  99  days
postvaccination); three induced abortions; and one 
fetal  demise  (at  35  days  postvaccination).  For  32  reports,  either  the  outcome  of
pregnancy was unknown or the patient was lost 
to  follow-up,  and  for  47  reports,  information  on  outcome  of  pregnancy  was  not  yet
available (sanofi pasteur, 
unreported data, 2008). 
A retrospective survey of 4,524 health-care personnel vaccinated in a mass vaccination
campaign conducted in 
2006 provides additional information regarding adverse reactions in pregnant women
within 14 days of receiving 
Tdap  (ADACEL®)  (215,216).  Pregnancy  was  not  an  exclusion  criterion  for  Tdap;  24
health-care personnel who received 
Tdap identified themselves as pregnant at the time of vaccination. Among 2,676 (59%)
survey respondents, 1,792 
(67%) received Tdap at an interval of >2 years after their most recent dose of Td; 17 of
these respondents identified themselves 
as  pregnant.  Adverse  reactions  reported  by  the  17  pregnant  women  were  compared
with reactions reported by 472 
nonpregnant  female  personnel  aged  18--44  years.  The  frequencies  of  injection-site
pain, redness, and swelling of moderate to 
severe  intensity  were  not  greater  among  the  pregnant  women  than  among  the
nonpregnant women. Three of the 
pregnant  women  reported  feeling  "feverish"  after  receiving  Tdap.  None  of  the  17
pregnant women reported seeking nonroutine medical 
attention for the adverse reaction (215,216). Among the pregnant women vaccinated
with Tdap, results of the outcome of pregnancy 
were known for 10 women; no pregnancy resulted in premature birth or abnormality in
the infant when assessed shortly after 
birth  (Elizabeth  A.  Talbot,  Dartmouth  College,  Lebanon,  New  Hampshire,  personal
communication, 2007).
Whole-Cell Pertussis Vaccine 
Five  clinical  trials  conducted  during  the  1930s  and  1940s  evaluated  vaccinating
pregnant women with whole-cell 
pertussis  vaccine  as  a  strategy  to  increase  the  levels  of  maternal  pertussis-specific
antibodies transferred to their infants via the 
placenta  (Table  9)  (186,189,190,192,193,217).  The  protective  efficacy  of  the  vaccine
against pertussis in the women was not 
a  consideration.  Whole-cell  pertussis  vaccine  was  prepared  from  sterile  extracts  of
killed
B.  pertussis.  To  maximize  the  passive  transfer  of  maternal  antibody,  pregnant
women were vaccinated with 2--6 doses at 1- to 2-week intervals during the 
third trimester.
Local  reactions  to  vaccination  in  the  pregnant  women  were  common,  some  of  which
were severe. Systemic reactions 
were uncommon, adverse pregnancy outcomes were not reported (Table 9) 
(190,192,193,217).
The majority of women had substantial rise in titer to 
B. pertussis antigens in postvaccination sera compared with 
prevaccine titers (Tables 4--6) 
(186,189,190,192,193,217). Neither history of pertussis 
(190,192) nor preexisting titers of antibodies 
in the women correlated with maternal titers after vaccination 
(193). The majority of infant antibody titers were lower 
than (186) or similar to maternal titers 
(37,150,186,187,189--193). Infant titers exceeded maternal titers in certain cases 
although higher titers might have been within the range of assay variation 
(37,186--191,193).
In subsets of infants in two studies, the duration of detectable transplacental pertussis
antibodies was followed 
among  unvaccinated  infants  (186,217).  The  mothers  in  both  studies  had  received  3
doses of whole-cell pertussis vaccine during 
the  third  trimester.  The  mean  of  the  agglutinin  titers  among  13  infants  in  one  study
dropped 
from 1:160§ at birth to 1:80 at age 
2 months; titers no longer were measurable at "a few months of age" 
(186). Of 36 infants with high agglutinin titers 
at birth in the other study, 16 (44%) had titers of 
>1:300 at age 3 months. None of 9 infants followed to age 6 months had a titer 
of 1:300 (217).
Infant Protection by Transplacental Maternal Antibody 
The  role  of  transplacental  maternal  antibody  in  infant  protection  against  pertussis
remains uncertain. Prevaccine 
era observations concluded that infants have no "congenital 
immunity" and are susceptible to pertussis from the "day of 
birth,"  with  the  possible  exception  of  an  infant  whose  mother  had  pertussis  during
pregnancy 
(35,189,190,192,193,219
).  Transplacental  maternal  antibodies  might  explain  the  smaller  proportion  of  infant
pertussis deaths observed in the first 
month of life compared with the second and third months of life (Figure 1) 
(35,45). An alternative explanation might be that 
parents avoid exposing newborn infants to ill contacts 
(99,219).
Two retrospective surveys were conducted after early vaccine trials in pregnant women
to assess infant protection 
(217,220).  In  one  survey  conducted  during  the  1940s,  a  subset  of  100  (59%)  of  170
women who received 6 doses of whole-cell 
pertussis vaccine during the third trimester and 100 women who were not vaccinated
were questioned regarding pertussis in 
their  infants  during  the  first  year  of  life.  During  the  first  6  months  of  life,  eight
exposures (three of which were "close 
exposures") and no cases of pertussis were reported among 
infants whose mothers had been vaccinated, and six exposures and three 
cases  of  infant  pertussis  were  reported  among  infants  whose  mothers  had  not  been
vaccinated. From age 
6--11 months, two cases of infant pertussis were reported in each group 
(220). In a second survey by the same investigators, a subset of 66 (62%) of 
106  women  who  received  3  doses  of  whole-cell  pertussis  vaccine  during  the  third
trimester 
reported two exposures and no case of pertussis among their infants during the first 6
months of life 
(217). The results of these surveys suggested that 
high  concentration  of  transplacental  pertussis  antibodies  might  provide  a  degree  of
infant protection against pertussis in the first 
6 months of life (217,220).
Inhibitory Effect of Transplacental Maternal Antibody on Infant Immunization
Transplacental maternal antibodies to pertussis antigens can interfere with the infant's
response to active immunization 
with the pertussis components of pediatric DTP and pediatric DTaP 
(221). A proposed mechanism for the interference 
with  pertussis  and  other  vaccine  antigens  is  maternal  antibody  binding  to  vaccine
antigens, masking the vaccine antigens from 
the  infant's  B  cells.  Infant  antigen-presenting  cells  also  might  take  up  maternal
antibody-vaccine antigen complexes 
stimulating  selective  T-cell  responses  without  humoral  immune  responses  to  the
vaccine antigens 
(221--223).  The  concentrations  and  specificities  of  the  maternal  antibodies  for
vaccine-antigen epitopes contributes to the degree of interference 
(221,223--225).  The  inhibitory  effect  of  transplacental  maternal  antibody  can  be
detectable for a few weeks or for more 
than 1 year (221,222,224--228). As transplacental 
maternal antibody declines over time, a threshold is reached when the 
infant's immune system responds to vaccine antigens in subsequent doses. In theory,
the threshold concentration of 
residual maternal antibody could be lower than the concentration of antibody needed
for infant protection, but this concentration 
is not known for pertussis. In this setting, a theoretical window of "relative 
susceptibility" exists for the infant until the 
infant mounts a humoral immune response to a subsequent dose of vaccine 
(222,229).
Interference with Pertussis Responses to Pediatric DTP 
Substantially lower concentrations of infant IgG anti-PT result after 3 doses of pediatric
DTP among infants with 
"high"  (variably  defined)  prevaccination  levels  of  maternal  IgG  anti-PT,  than  among
infants with "low" or no 
measurable prevaccination level of maternal IgG anti-PT 
(195, 230--233). The post-dose 3 concentrations of infant anti-PT in one 
study were 28% or 56% lower with each doubling of the concentration of transplacental
maternal anti-PT, respectively, for the 
two DTP products studied (p <0.05) 
(233). The reductions in post--dose 3 concentrations also were significant for 
anti-FIM (18% lower) and agglutinins (15% lower) for one DTP product, and for anti-FHA
(16% lower) for the other DTP 
product, with each doubling of the concentration of the specific transplacental maternal
antibodies (p
<0.05) (233).
Interference with Pertussis Responses to Pediatric DTaP 
Transplacental maternal IgG anti-PT might interfere less with infant responses after 3
doses of pediatric DTaP than 
after pediatric DTP (195,196,230,233). The percentage 
decrease in post--dose 3 infant antibody response with each doubling 
of  the  concentration  of  maternal  antibodies  was  3%  for  anti-PT  (not  statistically
significant), but was 13% for anti-PRN, 
17% for anti-FIM, 10% for agglutinins, and 8% for anti-FHA (all statistically significant; p
<0.05) when results from several DTaP products were combined in one study 
(233). The difference between interference by maternal antibody with infant 
responses to DTP and DTaP might result from the higher content of pertussis-specific
antigens in pediatric DTaP than in 
pediatric 
DTP relative to the concentration of transplacental maternal antibody 
(159,222). In addition, the maternal 
antibodies  induced  by  the  mothers'  childhood  DTP  vaccinations  might  have  less
specificity for the pertussis vaccine antigens in 
acellular pertussis vaccines (222,234--236).
Noninterference with Pertussis Cellular Immune Responses to Pediatric DTP or DTaP
Infants  who  have  relatively  poor  humoral  immune  responses  to  active  immunization
with whole-cell or acellular 
pertussis  vaccine  in  the  presence  of  inhibitory  concentrations  of  transplacental
maternal antibody have evidence of T-cell priming 
for  booster  (anamestic)  responses  (158,237).  Protection  against  pertussis  in  T-cell
primed infants in the absence of 
specific humoral antibodies has not been established 
(158,238--241).
Lactation 
Existing  data  do  not  provide  evidence  that  human  colostral  pertussis  antibodies
contribute to infant protection, 
although pertussis-specific antibodies present in the mother are found in colostral milk 
(186,190,242).  Protection  studies  in  animal  models  suggest  human  and  animal
colostral-derived pertussis antibodies can protect animals when the antibodies 
are absorbed or injected parenterally 
(243--245); however, the relevance of these studies for human infants is 
uncertain  (190,246,247).  Human  breast  milk  antibodies  do  not  enter  the  human
neonatal circulation from the intestine in 
substantial amounts. In contrast, infant pigs, horses, ruminants, dogs, and cats acquire
the majority of neonatal protection 
through intestinal uptake of colostral antibodies 
(245,248--250). Maternal antibodies in human milk do not interfere with the 
infant immune response to pediatric vaccines 
(23).
Tetanus 
Tetanus  is  caused  by  Clostridium  tetani  spores,  which  are  ubiquitous  in  the
environment. Spores enter the body 
through disrupted skin or mucus membranes. When inoculated into oxygen-poor sites
(e.g., necrotic tissue or wounds), 
C.  tetani  spores  germinate  to  vegetative  bacilli  that  elaborate  tetanospasmin,  a
potent neurotoxin. More than 80% of cases of tetanus 
are of the generalized syndrome; the remaining cases are localized or cephalic. Persons
with generalized cases typically have 
trismus (lockjaw), followed by rigidity and painful contractions of the skeletal muscles
that can impair respiratory function. 
Glottic  spasm,  respiratory  failure,  and  autonomic  instability  can  result  in  death.  The
onset of tetanus typically is within 7 days of 
the  injury  (range:  0--112  days)  The  course  of  tetanus  is  up  to  4  weeks  or  longer,
followed by a prolonged period of 
convalescence (251,252).
Obstetric and Neonatal Tetanus 
Obstetric tetanus is defined as tetanus during pregnancy or with onset within 6 weeks
after the termination of 
pregnancy (253). Obstetric tetanus occurs after contamination of wounds or abrasions
during pregnancy or after unclean deliveries 
or  abortions.  In  a  review  covering  1941--1990,  an  estimated  65%--80%  of  cases  of
obstetric tetanus occurred in the puerperal 
or  postpartum  period;  the  majority  of  the  other  cases  occurred  after  surgical  or
spontaneous abortions 
(254).
Obstetric  tetanus  has  the  highest  mortality  when  the  incubation  period  is  short  and
respiratory complications are 
present (255). Cases can be complicated by gram-negative sepsis 
(256). Case-fatality rates vary (range: 16%-->50%); higher 
fatality rates are reported from places where access to medical intensive care is limited
(255,257,258). Case-fatality rates 
historically have been higher for postabortal than for postpartum obstetric tetanus 
(254).
Neonatal  tetanus  (tetanus  neonatorum)  is  associated  with  contamination  of  the
umbilical stump. In nearly all cases of 
infant  tetanus,  onset  occurs  in  the  first  month  of  life.  Symptoms  commonly  begin  at
3--14 days of life and are characterized 
by increasing irritability and difficulty feeding. Signs of neonatal tetanus are similar to
tetanus in older age groups. 
Case-fatality rates vary (range: 10%--100%) 
(252,259). Infants who survive can have residual neurologic injury (e.g., cerebral palsy 
and psychomotor retardation) (252).
Burden 
Tetanus is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States 
(260). In 2006, a total of 41 cases were reported. No 
cases occurred among women aged 15--19 years or those aged 
30--39 years. One case occurred among women aged 20--29 
years, and three cases occurred among women aged 40--49 years. None of the women
died. During 1972--2006, 
case reporting forms did not collect information regarding pregnancy; however, no case
of obstetric tetanus was identified 
among  more  than  1,000  reports  to  NNDSS  (CDC,  unpublished  data,  2006).  In  1999,
tetanus-specific coding became available 
in CDC's mortality database; no case of tetanus-associated 
obstetric death was reported through 2005, the most recent year 
for which data are available (CDC, unpublished data, 2008). 
During the 1950s, approximately 100 neonatal tetanus deaths were reported annually
in the United States, and 
neonates comprised more than one third of tetanus deaths in all age groups 
(261,262). During 1972--2006, the cumulative number 
of  reported  neonatal  tetanus  cases  decreased  to  32;  the  most  recent  cases  were
reported in 1989, 1995, 1998, and 2001 
(263).  Among  these  32  neonatal  cases,  27  (84%)  births  occurred  in  a  nonhospital
setting; 30 of 31 mothers with available 
history reported never having received a dose of tetanus toxoid vaccine 
(264--266; CDC, unpublished data, 2006).
Diagnosis and Treatment 
The  diagnosis  of  tetanus  is  clinical  and  is  supported  by  a  compatible  setting,
immunization history, and exclusion of 
other possible diseases. Anaerobic cultures of tissues or aspirates for 
C. tetani typically are not positive. Low or undetectable levels 
of serum antitoxin at the time of onset are compatible with the diagnosis of tetanus,
but higher levels of antitoxin do not 
exclude the diagnosis (252,267). Electromyography might aid in the diagnosis of certain
cases 
(268).  Postpartum  eclampsia,  which  typically  occurs  within  the  first  few  days  after
delivery, was the most important disease in the differential diagnosis 
in community-based studies (254).
Treatment  of  tetanus  is  directed  at  neutralizing  unbound  toxin  with  administration  of
human tetanus immune 
globulin,  removing  the  source  of  infection  through  debridement,  and  use  of  an
antimicrobial (e.g., metronidazole). The control 
of  rigidity  and  spasms,  attendant  respiratory  and  autonomic  dysfunction  and  their
complications, and maintaining 
nutrition require careful and sustained attention that is best provided in intensive-care
settings with specialty 
consultation (251,252,269).
Immunity to Tetanus 
The level of antitoxin that protects against obstetric and neonatal tetanus can vary with
the wound characteristics, the 
degree  of  contamination,  the  specificity  of  the  antitoxin,  and  the  type  of  assay
employed to measure the antitoxin level 
(270).  The  minimum  level  of  antitoxin  correlating  with  protection  is  0.01  IU/mL  as
measured by in vivo neutralization assay. 
An antitoxin concentration at >0.1 IU/mL is the preferred correlate of protection based
on the results of other assays 
(e.g., enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay [ELISA]), and 
because higher concentrations of antitoxin might be necessary 
to protect in certain circumstances 
(252,270). The serum level of tetanus antitoxin achieved in response to vaccination 
is  determined  by  the  number  of  doses  of  tetanus  toxoid,  the  type  of  tetanus  toxoid
administered (adjuvanted toxoid, which 
is  more  immunogenic,  has  replaced  fluid  toxoid),  the  interval  since  the  most  recent
dose, and individual variation in 
the response to vaccination (270).
Deferring Td During Pregnancy to Substitute Tdap in the Immediate 
Postpartum Period 
Ensuring maternal and neonatal tetanus protection as part of prenatal care is a priority
for women who are due for 
a  recommended  decennial  tetanus  and  diphtheria  toxoids  booster  dose.  For  women
who have not received a dose of 
Tdap previously, administering Td during pregnancy, followed in a few months by Tdap
postpartum, theoretically 
could increase the risk or severity of adverse reaction, which typically is local. Moderate
to severe local reactions have 
been  associated  with  high  levels  of  tetanus  and  diphtheria  antitoxin  (see  Interval
Between Td and Tdap). In these women, 
deferring  the  Td  booster  during  pregnancy  to  substitute  Tdap  in  the  immediate
postpartum period may be considered to 
boost  protection  against  pertussis  as  well  as  tetanus  and  diphtheria.  The  majority  of
women of childbearing age who have lived 
in 
the United States since infancy or childhood have received 
4--5 infant and childhood doses of tetanus toxoid with 
pediatric DTP or DTaP and >1 booster dose of Td (or tetanus toxoid without diphtheria
toxoid [TT]) in accordance with 
national  recommendations  (1,2,271).  The  recommended  schedule  of  vaccination  to
prevent tetanus is intended to maintain levels 
of antitoxin considerably higher than the minimum level required for protection against
the majority of cases of 
tetanus,  including  protection  among  persons  with  intrinsically  lower  responses  to
vaccination 
(1,2,252,271--273).
In 2004, women aged 15--39 years accounted for 97% of all births in the United States 
(3).  Data  from  a  population-based  serosurvey  conducted  nationwide  in  the  United
States during 1988--1994 documented tetanus antitoxin concentrations 
at >0.15 IU/mL among >80% of women aged 12--39 years 
(274,275). The proportion of women with antitoxin at 
>0.15 IU/mL declined with increasing age to 62% among women aged 40--49 years 
(274,275). Slightly lower prevalence of this 
titer  was  found  among  women  aged  20--59  years  who  were  not  born  in  the  United
States 
(276). A 1999--2000 study evaluated 2,134 adult patients in an emergency department
for wound management and measurement of their antitoxin titer 
(277). Antitoxin concentrations of 
>0.15  IU/mL  were  present  among  1,051  (95%)  of  1,106  adults  aged  18--39  years.
Among 
adults  of  all  ages  studied,  approximately  95%  of  those  with  up-to-date  vaccination
histories and approximately 86% of those 
whose vaccinations were not up-to-date had antitoxin titers >0.15 IU/mL. The rates of a
protective titer were lower for 
immigrants, persons with less education, and persons aged >70 years 
(277). Limitations of these studies are that one study did not 
report any connection between vaccination histories and antitoxin concentrations 
(274--276), and the other study included 
subjects who might not be representative of the U.S. population 
(277). However, when combined with the small number of 
tetanus  cases  among  women  of  childbearing  age  in  the  United  States,  these  studies
suggest that when pregnant women have 
previously  received  the  recommended  schedule  of  tetanus  and  diphtheria  toxoids
vaccinations, a routine decennial Td booster 
during pregnancy typically can be deferred so Tdap can be substituted at delivery or
before discharge from the hospital or 
birthing center. 
Vaccinating to Prevent Obstetric and Neonatal 
Tetanus 
Success in preventing obstetric and neonatal tetanus relies on antitoxin being present
at delivery 
(254).  In  countries  where  access  to  childhood  vaccines  is  limited,  neonatal  tetanus
constitutes a major cause of infant mortality; during 1978--1985, 
an estimated 800,000 neonatal tetanus deaths occurred 
annually worldwide (278). In 1974, worldwide elimination of 
neonatal tetanus (less than one case per 1,000 live births) through vaccine initiatives
became a major focus of the 
Expanded Program of Immunization of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) (259,279). The initiative promoted clean deliveries and 
tetanus  toxoid  vaccination  for  pregnant  women.  Nonpregnant  women  of  childbearing
age also were targeted for at least 3 doses 
of tetanus toxoid vaccine in supplemental immunization activities. 
The strategy of targeting pregnant women for vaccination to prevent neonatal tetanus
was based on reports published in 
the 1960s concerning two vaccine trials that demonstrated that 
>2 doses of tetanus toxoid administered during pregnancy 
were >95% effective in preventing neonatal tetanus 
(Table 10) (280,281). Subsequent studies confirmed that 3 doses of 
aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted tetanus toxoid (rather than fluid toxoid) administered
during pregnancy induced antitoxin levels 
that would protect the mother and prevent neonatal tetanus for >10 years. Adjuvanted
vaccine also lowered the rates of 
local reactions in pregnant women (282--284).
Although  the  burden  of  obstetric  tetanus  has  not  been  characterized  as  well  as  the
burden of neonatal tetanus, the 
annual  worldwide  burden  of  obstetric  tetanus  deaths  has  been  estimated  at
15,000--30,000, accounting for approximately 5% of 
all maternal deaths in the 1990s 
(254,259). In April 2006, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) reported on
the success of the maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination initiatives and the plan to
transition from vaccination goals 
for  women  of  childbearing  age  to  universal  tetanus  control,  to  be  achieved  through
sustained high coverage with 
pediatric DTP starting in infancy and childhood and booster doses to prevent tetanus
throughout life 
(259,285,286).
Safety of Tetanus Vaccination During Pregnancy 
No  evidence  suggests  that  adverse  outcomes  for  a  mother  or  fetus  increase  after
tetanus toxoid is administered to a 
pregnant  woman  (1,2,23).  Tetanus  toxoid  administered  during  any  trimester  of
pregnancy was evaluated for association with 
congenital abnormalities at birth during 1980--1994 in Budapest, Hungary. The rate of
tetanus toxoid vaccination among 
21,563 mothers of infants with congenital abnormalities was not significantly different
than the rate of tetanus toxoid 
vaccination  among  35,727  mothers  of  infants  who  were  normal  (0.12%  and  0.09%,
respectively; p = 0.39) 
(287). In a similar study 
conducted in nine countries in South America starting in 1977, approximately one half
of the women had received 
tetanus toxoid during the first trimester of pregnancy. The rate of early tetanus toxoid
vaccination among the mothers of 
34,293  newborns  with  congenital  malformations  (9.2  [CI  =  8.2--10.3]  per  1,000
mothers) was not substantially different than the 
rate among the mothers of 34,477 newborns who were normal (7.6 [CI = 6.6--8.5] per
1,000 mothers) 
(288).
Infant Protection by Transplacental Maternal Antibody 
Tetanus  toxoid  is  one  of  the  most  immunogenic  protein  antigens  in  any  vaccine.
Administration of 2 doses of tetanus 
toxoid to pregnant women at least 4--6 weeks before delivery stimulates antitoxin that
protects the mother and readily crosses 
the placenta, thereby protecting the newborn against tetanus when the risk is highest 
(289).  Pregnant  women  who  receive  a  booster  dose  of  tetanus  toxoid  have  a
measurable immune response within 5 days and a peak response in <2 weeks. 
The response to vaccination might be slower after a first (primary) dose or when the
interval after the most recent booster dose 
is long (252,272). Placental transport of maternal IgG antitoxin is efficient; cord blood
levels generally are similar to 
maternal  levels  (290,291).  After  the  neonatal  period,  the  infant  is  at  little  risk  for
tetanus until becoming self-mobile, typically at an 
age when sustained protection has been induced by 3 
infant doses of pediatric DTP or DTaP (252).
Inhibitory Effect of Transplacental Maternal Antibody on Infant Immunization
Transplacental  maternal  tetanus  antitoxin  can  interfere  with  the  infant  response  to
active immunization after up to 3 
doses of tetanus toxoid (e.g., in pediatric DTP, DTaP, or DT) 
(222,230,292--297). Certain studies 
(296,297),  but  not  all  (298),  indicate  that  antitoxin  inhibits  the  response  to  tetanus
toxoid after vaccination with
Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid. An 
age-accelerated schedule results in further decrease in infant 
responses in the presence of maternal antitoxin 
(295).  When  levels  of  transplacental  maternal  antitoxin  wane  sufficiently,  infants
respond 
to subsequent doses of vaccine 
(229,293,294,299--301).  T-cell  priming  for  a  booster  response  is  not  substantially
affected 
by maternal antitoxin (222,302, 303). Typically, infants respond to the second dose of
tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine with 
a  protective  level  of  antitoxin,  even  when  the  initial  levels  of  maternal  antitoxin  are
high; 
3 doses of tetanus toxoid are required to achieve antitoxin concentrations that persist
above protective levels 
(292,304).
Lactation 
No substantial difference in the infant immune response to tetanus toxoid (in DTP) has
been identified with consumption 
of human milk compared with consumption of cow milk 
(305).
Diphtheria 
Respiratory diphtheria is an acute, severe infection caused by strains of 
Corynebacterium diphtheriae that produce 
diphtheria toxin. Rarely, toxin-producing strains of 
C. ulcerans cause a diphtheria-like illness 
(306). Respiratory diphtheria is characterized by a grayish-colored adherent membrane
on the pharynx, palate, or nasal mucosa that can obstruct the 
airway with fatal outcome. The disease can be complicated by toxin-mediated cardiac,
neurologic, or renal dysfunction. 
Case-fatality rates are >10% 
(307,308).
Obstetric and Neonatal Diphtheria 
Respiratory diphtheria (309--312) or vulvovaginal infection 
(313,314) can occur during any trimester of pregnancy, at 
term, or in the postpartum period. The mortality rate of 
obstetric respiratory diphtheria is high (estimated at 50%) without 
infusion  of  diphtheria  antitoxin,  even  with  tracheostomy  or  intubation,  and  is
accompanied by fetal loss or premature birth 
in approximately one third of survivors. Early treatment with serum diphtheria antitoxin
improves survival and 
pregnancy  outcomes,  although  complications  of  the  disease  might  require  prolonged
supportive care 
(309--312). Postpartum women with respiratory diphtheria can transmit 
C. diphtheriae to their neonates 
(310).
Burden 
Respiratory diphtheria is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States. Rare cases
occur in the United States 
after  infection  with  diphtheria  toxin--producing  strains  of  C.  diphtheriae  or  other
corynebacteria 
(315,316). During 1998--2006, seven cases of respiratory diphtheria were reported to
CDC. The most recent culture-confirmed adult case of 
respiratory diphtheria caused by C. 
diphtheriae was reported in 2000, and an adult case of respiratory diphtheria caused by
C. ulcerans was reported in 2005 
(306). The risk for diphtheria can be increased during travel to areas in which diphtheria
is endemic; a list 
of  these  areas  is  available  at  http://www.cdc.gov/travel/default.aspx.  Diphtheria  also
can be acquired from persons with 
imported  cases  or  from  carriers  (i.e.,  asymptomatic  persons  who  are  colonized  with
toxin-producing
C. diphtheriae) (315,316).
Diagnosis and Treatment 
The diagnosis of diphtheria is confirmed by isolation of 
C. diphtheriae in culture of the adherent membrane and by 
testing the isolate for toxin production 
(317). The mainstay of treatment in respiratory diphtheria is early administration 
of  diphtheria  antitoxin  (equine),  which  is  available  to  physicians  in  the  United  States
from CDC through an 
FDA-Investigational  New  Drug  protocol  (24-hour  telephone,  770-488-7100).  Additional
information is available 
at
 http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/diphtheria/dat/dat-main.htm.
 No
human-derived serum diphtheria antitoxin is 
available. Antibiotics are administered to limit transmission and to prevent continuing
production of diphtheria toxin 
(318).  Prompt  reporting  of  suspect  cases,  investigation,  culture,  and  antimicrobial
prophylaxis of contacts and immunization of the 
affected community (317,318) is of critical importance. 
Because respiratory diphtheria does not always confer protection against 
future illness, patients should complete active immunization 
with diphtheria toxoid after recovery (286).
Diphtheria Immunity 
Protection  against  respiratory  diphtheria  is  predominantly  from  IgG  antibody  to
diphtheria toxin (antitoxin) induced 
after infection with toxin-producing C. 
diphtheriae or after vaccination with diphtheria toxoid. In areas with little or no 
endemic exposure to toxin-producing C. 
diphtheriae, periodic vaccination is required to maintain immunity 
(237,286,307, 319--321). Although the immune responses to infection and vaccination
vary, antitoxin concentrations of 
>0.1  IU/mL  typically  are  considered  protective.  Concentrations  of  0.01  IU/mL--0.1
IU/mL might provide protection against severe 
disease; concentrations <0.01 IU/mL do not protect against diphtheria 
(286,307,322).
Td Booster During Pregnancy for Diphtheria Protection 
Data  from  a  national  population-based  serosurvey  conducted  during  1988--1994  that
evaluated the prevalence of 
immunity to diphtheria (defined as a diphtheria antitoxin concentration of >0.1 IU/mL)
among women in the United States 
determined immunity to diphtheria to be lower than immunity to tetanus (see Tetanus:
Deferring Td During Pregnancy to 
Substitute Tdap in the Immediate Postpartum Period). The prevalence of immunity to
diphtheria decreased with increasing age 
(77% among women aged 12--19 years, 74% among women aged 20--29 years, 65%
among women aged 30--39 years, and
<45%  among  women  aged  >40  years)  and  with  birth  outside  the  United  States  or
less formal education 
(274,276).
Vaccinating Pregnant Women, Infant Protection by Transplacental Antibody
Diphtheria  toxoid  vaccine  trials  conducted  among  pregnant  women  in  the  1940s
demonstrated quantitative increases 
in diphtheria antitoxin after the women were vaccinated. 
Maternal antitoxin was transferred efficiently to the 
fetus (217,226,320,323,324). Several studies indicate transplacental maternal antitoxin
provides newborn infants with 
protection against diphtheria at birth if their mother 
is immune (226,250,321,325).
Safety 
The safety of diphtheria toxoid (without tetanus toxoid) vaccination in pregnant women
was examined during the 
1970s  (326).  After  diphtheria  toxoid  was  administered  during  the  first  4  months  of
pregnancy, 75 mother-child pairs were 
followed for malformations until the child reached age 7 years. Although the number of
vaccinated pregnant women studied was 
small,  the  risk  for  malformations  in  their  children  was  lower  than  the  risk  among
children in a much larger group of 
mother-child 
pairs in which the women were not vaccinated with diphtheria toxoid during pregnancy
(survival- and 
race-standardized relative risk: 0.88) (327).
Inhibitory Effect of Transplacental Maternal Antibody on Infant Immunization
Transplacental maternal diphtheria antitoxin concentrations of <0.1 IU/mL can interfere
with primary diphtheria 
toxoid immunization in infancy 
(237,292,321,328--331). The duration of interference is affected by the concentration of
maternal antitoxin, the formulation and toxoid content of the infant vaccine (e.g., the
limit of flocculation [Lf] units of 
diphtheria toxoid, aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed, or fluid preparation), and the length
of the interval between 
doses 
(229,237,292,293,295,
299,321,328--331). Infants typically respond with increases in antitoxin after 2 doses of 
high-content diphtheria toxoid vaccine when maternal antitoxin concentrations are 0.1
IU/mL in cord sera but not until after
>3  infant  doses  of  high-content  diphtheria  toxoid  vaccine  when  maternal  antitoxin
concentrations are
>1.0 IU/mL in cord sera 
(225,229,292,299,321,329,331,332). When infants 
receive subsequent doses of diphtheria toxoid, the responses are 
rapid, often within 2 weeks (330), suggesting that T-cell priming occurs in the absence
of an infant antibody response to 
previous doses of vaccine 
(229,237,324,329,330).
Lactation 
Consumption of human milk does not affect the infant 
immune response to diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccines (292,332). Ingestion of colostrum from an immune mother does not result in
an increase in the concentration of 
diphtheria antitoxin in infant sera (250).
Adult and Adolescent Acellular Pertussis Combined with Tetanus 
and Reduced Diphtheria Toxoids (Tdap) Vaccines and Tetanus and 
Reduced Diphtheria Toxoids (Td) Vaccines 
Both Tdap vaccines used in the United States 
(ADACEL® and 
BOOSTRIX®) were licensed on the basis of clinical trials 
in the United States demonstrating immunogenicity not inferior to that of U.S.-licensed
Td 
(333,334)  and  the  pertussis  components  of  pediatric  DTaP  made  by  the  same
manufacturer and an acceptable safety profile 
(212,213). Adsorbed Td products for adults and adolescents have been licensed in the
United States since the 1950s 
(335). Components of these and other diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids--containing vaccines have been listed (Table 1) and are available at 
http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccines.htm . 
In prelicensure trials, data on local and systemic adverse events were collected using
standard diaries for the day 
of vaccination and the next 14 consecutive days 
(212,213,336--338). The efficacies of the tetanus toxoid and the 
diphtheria  toxoid  components  of  Tdap  were  inferred  from  the  immunogenicity  of  the
antigens in Tdap compared with Td 
using  established  serologic  correlates  of  protection  in  sera  obtained  before  and
approximately 1 month after vaccination. Because 
no  well-accepted  serologic  or  laboratory  correlate  of  protection  is  available  for
pertussis, the efficacy of the pertussis 
components of Tdap was inferred using a serologic bridge (comparison) to the immune
response to vaccine antigens among infants 
who  received  3  doses  of  pediatric  DTaP  (made  by  the  same  manufacturer)  during
clinical efficacy trials for pertussis during 
the 1990s (339). The efficacy against pertussis of an acellular pertussis vaccine without
tetanus and diphtheria toxoids was 
92% (CI = 32%--99%) for adults and adolescents in a randomized, controlled trial 
(340); these results were not considered in 
the evaluation of Tdap for licensure in the United States. 
Selected  results  from  the  prelicensure  trials  are  summarized  below.  Additional
information can be found in previous 
ACIP  statements  discussing  use  of  Tdap  among  adults  and  adolescents  and  in  the
package labels of the specific products 
(1,2,212,213).
ADACEL® 
ADACEL®  contains  the  same  tetanus  toxoid,  diphtheria  toxoid,  and  five  pertussis
antigens as those in 
DAPTACEL® (pediatric DTaP, also made by sanofi pasteur), but 
ADACEL® is formulated with reduced quantities of diphtheria toxoid 
and detoxified PT. Prelicensure trials in the United States evaluated the immunogenicity
and the safety of 
ADACEL® among 
adults  aged  18--64  years  and  among  adolescents  aged  11--17  years,  randomized  to
receive a single dose of 
ADACEL® or a single dose of Td made by the same manufacturer (Table 1) 
(1,2,212,333). Pregnant women were excluded.
Immunogenicity 
Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids. The rates of seroprotection and booster response for
both antitetanus and 
antidiphtheria among adults and adolescents who received a single dose of 
ADACEL® were noninferior to rates among those who 
received Td. Nearly all (>99%) subjects in the 
ADACEL® and Td groups achieved seroprotective antitetanus levels 
(>0.1 IU/mL), and >94% of adults and >99% of 
adolescents achieved seroprotective antidiphtheria levels 
(>0.1 IU/mL) in ADACEL® and 
Td groups (212,341).
Pertussis Antigens. The efficacy of the pertussis components was inferred by comparing
the immune responses (GMCs) 
of adults and adolescents vaccinated with a single dose of 
ADACEL® to those of infants vaccinated with 3 doses 
of DAPTACEL® in a Swedish vaccine efficacy trial 
(338,342). The efficacy of 3 doses of pediatric 
DAPTACEL® against WHO-defined pertussis 
(>21 days of paroxysmal cough with confirmation of 
B. pertussis infection by culture or serologic testing, 
or an epidemiologic link to a household member with culture-confirmed pertussis) was
85% (CI = 80%--89%) 
(338,342).  The  GMCs  of  anti-PT,  anti-FHA,  anti-PRN,  and  anti-FIM  among  adults  and
adolescents after a single dose of 
ADACEL® were noninferior to those of infants after 3 doses of 
DAPTACEL.® The prespecified criteria 
for booster responses also were met 
(1,2,212,336,341).
Safety 
The  safety  of  ADACEL®  was  evaluated  in  four  clinical  studies  with  data  from  2,448
adults aged 18--64 years and 
3,393 adolescents aged 11--17 years (212).
Immediate  Events.  No  anaphylaxis  was  reported.  Five  adults  reported  an  immediate
event within 30 minutes of 
vaccination (four persons [0.2%] for ADACEL® and one person [0.2%] for Td); three of
these five events were classified as 
nervous system disorders (hypoesthesia/paresthesia). Eleven adolescents reported an
immediate event (six persons [0.5%] 
for ADACEL® and five persons [0.6%] for Td); these events included dizziness, syncope,
or vasovagal reactions in addition 
to pain and erythema at the injection site. All events 
resolved without sequelae (338,341,343).
Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events. Rates of erythema and swelling 
(Figures 3 and 4), or systemic (headache, generalized body aches, and tiredness [data
not presented]) adverse events reported to occur during 0--14 days 
following vaccination with Td or Tdap were similar 
(1,2,212,338,341). Fever 
>100.4°F 
(>38°C) was reported with the same 
frequency by adults vaccinated with Td and with Tdap (Figure 3) 
(212); the rate of any fever reported by adolescents vaccinated 
with Tdap (5%) was higher than the rate for those vaccinated with Td (3%) but met the
noninferiority  criterion  (Figure  4)  (212,341).  No  case  of  whole-arm  swelling  was
reported 
(341).
Serious  Adverse  Events.  Among  adults,  serious  adverse  events  (e.g.,  appendicitis)
within 6 months after vaccination 
were reported for 33 (2%) of 1,752 persons in the ADACEL® group and for 11 (2%) of
573 persons in the Td group 
(338,341). Two serious adverse events in 
ADACEL®  recipients  were  neuropathic  and  were  assessed  by  the  investigators  as
possibly 
related to vaccination. In both cases, the symptoms resolved completely over several
days 
(1,212,338,  341,343).  Among  adolescents,  serious  adverse  events  within  6  months
after vaccination were reported for 11 (1%) of 1,184 persons in the 
ADACEL®  group  and  for  eight  (1%)  of  792  persons  in  the  Td  group.  All  events  were
reported by investigators to be unrelated to the 
study  vaccine  (341).  No  physician-diagnosed  Arthus  reaction  (see  Important  Local
Reactions) or case of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome (see Neurologic and Systemic Events) was reported 
(1).
Simultaneous Administration of Tdap with Other 
Vaccines 
Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine. The safety and immunogenicity of 
ADACEL® co-administered with 
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine ([TIV] 
Fluzone,® sanofi pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) were evaluated in nonpregnant 
adults aged 19--64 years randomized to simultaneous administration in different arms
(n = 359), or to TIV administered 
first, followed by ADACEL® 4--6 weeks later (n = 361). Rates of fever and injection site
erythema and swelling were 
similar following ADACEL® administered concurrently with TIV or separately. Pain at the
ADACEL® injection site occurred 
more  frequently  after  simultaneous  administration  than  after  separate  administration
(67% and 61%, respectively) 
(338).  Immunogenicity  criteria  were  met  with  the  following  exceptions:  the  GMC  of
anti-PRN was lower in the simultaneous 
group than in the sequential group (338,344), and the tetanus booster response rates
were lower after simultaneous 
administration 
than after sequential administration (79% and 83%, respectively). However, more than
98% of subjects in both 
groups achieved seroprotective levels (>0.1 IU/mL) of tetanus antitoxin 
(338,344).
Hepatitis B Vaccine. The safety and immunogenicity of 
ADACEL® administered with hepatitis B (Hep B) 
vaccine  (Recombivax  HB,®  Merck  and  Co.,  White  House  Station,  New  Jersey)  were
evaluated among nonpregnant adolescents 
aged 11--14 years randomized to simultaneous administration (n = 206) or to 
ADACEL® administered first, followed by 
hepatitis B vaccine 4--6 weeks later (n = 204). Rates of solicited erythema and swelling
at the 
ADACEL® injection site were higher 
in  the  simultaneous  group  than  in  the  sequential  group,  and  noninferiority  was  not
achieved 
(1,338). No interference was observed in the immune responses to any of the vaccine
antigens when 
ADACEL® and hepatitis B vaccine were 
administered concurrently or separately 
(212).
BOOSTRIX® 
BOOSTRIX®  contains  the  same  tetanus  toxoid,  diphtheria  toxoid,  and  three  pertussis
antigens as those in 
INFANRIX® (pediatric DTaP, also made by 
GlaxoSmithKline), but BOOSTRIX® is formulated with reduced quantities of 
antigens.
 Prelicensure
 trials
 conducted
 in
 the
 United
 States
 evaluated
 the
immunogenicity and safety of 
BOOSTRIX® among adolescents aged 10--18 years 
(213,337), randomized to receive a single dose of 
BOOSTRIX®  or  a  single  dose  of  Td  (Massachusetts  Public  Health  Biologic  Laboratory,
Mattapan, Massachusetts) (Table 1) 
(213,334,337). Pregnant adolescents were excluded.
Immunogenicity 
Tetanus and Diphtheria Toxoids. The rates of seroprotection and booster response for
both antitetanus and 
antidiphtheria among adolescents who received a single dose of 
BOOSTRIX® were noninferior to those who received 
Td. All adolescents had seroprotective antitetanus levels 
(>0.1 IU/mL); >99% of adolescents had seroprotective antidiphtheria levels 
(>0.1 IU/mL) (1,213,336).
Pertussis Antigens. The efficacy of the pertussis components was inferred by comparing
the immune responses 
of adolescents vaccinated with a single dose of 
BOOSTRIX® with the immune responses of infants vaccinated with 3 doses 
of INFANRIX® in a German vaccine efficacy trial 
(213,336, 345). The efficacy of 3 doses of pediatric 
INFANRIX® against WHO-defined pertussis was 89% (CI = 77%--95%) 
(213,345). The GMCs of anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN after 
a single dose of BOOSTRIX® were noninferior to those of infants after 3 doses of 
INFANRIX.® The prespecified criteria 
for booster responses also were met 
(1,213,336,337).
Safety 
A total of 3,080 adolescents aged 10--18 years received 
BOOSTRIX® in the primary safety study 
(213).  No  immediate  events  (i.e.,  those  occurring  within  30  minutes  of  vaccination)
were reported 
(1,213,336,337).
Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events. No substantial differences were observed
between  the  BOOSTRIX®  and  Td  recipients  in  the  rates  of  solicited  local  (redness,
swelling, and increase in arm circumference above baseline) 
(Figure 5) or systemic (headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal systemic events, fever 
>100.4°F 
[>38.0°C] [data not presented]) adverse 
events (1,213,336,337). No case of whole-arm swelling was reported 
(1).
Serious Adverse Events. Serious adverse events within 
6 months after vaccination were reported among 14 (0.4%) of 
3,005  adolescents  vaccinated  with  BOOSTRIX®  and  two  (0.2%)  of  1,003  adolescents
vaccinated with Td. All events were 
reported by the investigators to be unrelated to the study vaccine 
(213,336,337,346). No physician-diagnosed Arthus reaction or 
case of Guillain-Barré syndrome was reported 
(1,213,337,346).
Pregnant Women Vaccinated with Tdap 
Pregnant  women  were  excluded  from  prelicensure  trials  of  Tdap.  The  outcome  of
pregnancy among six women who 
were administered ADACEL® inadvertently during or within 1 month of conception was
a healthy full-term infant (n = 3), 
a preterm infant (n = 1), or a miscarriage (n = 2). No infant was born with a congenital
anomaly (sanofi-pasteur, 
unreported data, 2007). Two pregnancies occurred in 
BOOSTRIX® recipients >4 months postvaccination; one subject experienced 
a  spontaneous  abortion  within  the  first  trimester,  and  the  other  subject  delivered  a
healthy infant 
(337).
Regulatory Considerations for Tdap in Pregnant 
Women 
As  with  the  majority  of  vaccines,  Tdap  is  labeled  pregnancy  category  C.  This
designation indicates that no adequate 
and well-controlled studies have been conducted with the vaccine in pregnant women
to determine the product's safety 
(347,348).
Safety Considerations for Adult and Adolescent Use of Td or Tdap
Prelicensure  studies  in  nonpregnant  adults  and  adolescents  evaluated  the  safety  of
Tdap with respect to local and 
systemic  adverse  events  (212,213).  The  sample  sizes  were  insufficient  to  detect  rare
adverse events. Enrollment criteria excluded 
persons  who  were  pregnant;  had  received  vaccines  containing  tetanus  toxoid,
diphtheria toxoid, or pertussis components more 
recently than either the preceding 5 years for 
ADACEL® (212) or the preceding 10 years for 
BOOSTRIX® (213); or had 
certain neurologic conditions or events 
(336--338,341,346). Safety data are being collected by the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting System (VAERS), and postlicensure studies continue to monitor for potential
adverse reactions following widespread use 
of  Tdap  in  adults  and  adolescents  (16,17).  Registries  have  been  established  by  both
Tdap manufacturers for reporting 
women vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy. 
Interval between Td and Tdap 
ACIP has made several recommendations for intervals 
between tetanus toxoid-- and diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccines  that  balance  the  benefits  of  protection  against  the  risks  of  moderate  and
severe local reactions. Moderate and severe 
local reactions, including Arthus reaction, are associated with frequent dosing at short
intervals and larger doses of toxoid. 
High antitoxin levels are more likely to result when the interval between doses is short
and the number of doses increases 
(349--354).  High  preexisting  antibody  titers  to  tetanus  or  diphtheria  toxoids  also  are
associated with increased rates and severity 
of local reactions to booster doses in adults 
(349,354--356).
ACIP recommends a 10-year interval for routine administration of Td (e.g., decennial Td
booster), and a 5-year interval 
for Td when indicated for wounds management 
(1,2,357). Administering Td more often than every 10 years (5 years for 
certain  nonclean,  nonminor  wounds)  is  not  necessary  to  provide  protection  against
tetanus or diphtheria; however, 
administering a single dose of Tdap at an interval shorter than 5 years after Td could
provide a health benefit by adding protection 
against pertussis (Table 2) (1,2). When Tdap is 
administered to add protection against pertussis, ACIP encourages an interval of
>5  years  between  the  most  recent  Td  and  the  Tdap  dose  for  adolescents  because
they might receive other recommended 
vaccines
 containing
 tetanus
 or
 diphtheria
 toxoids
 (including
 quadrivalent
meningococcal conjugate vaccine [MCV4] 
[Menactra,® sanofi pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania]) 
(2). An interval as short as 2 years is recommended between the most recent Td 
and the single dose of Tdap for health-care personnel with direct patient contact, and a 
2-year interval between the most recent Td and Tdap is suggested for adults in close
contact with infants 
(1). ACIP allows for a shorter interval between the most 
recent Td and administration of Tdap in certain circumstances that might require urgent
protection 
(1,2).
Several studies have suggested that an interval as short as 
2 years between Td and a single dose of Tdap is acceptably safe. 
Three  studies  conducted  among  Canadian  children  and  adolescents  evaluated  the
safety of Tdap 
(ADACEL®) at an interval shorter than 5 years after Td or after pediatric DTP or DTaP 
(358--360). The largest was an open-label study of 7,001 students aged 
7--19 years. Rates of local reactions were not increased 
among students who had received the most recent of 5 pediatric DTP 
or DTaP doses, or a Td dose, >2 years before Tdap, compared with >10 years before
Tdap (358). The other Canadian 
studies demonstrated similar safety when Tdap was administered at an interval of <5
years after the previous 
tetanus toxoid-- and diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccine (359,360).
Adverse reactions after Tdap 
(ADACEL®)  administered  at  an  interval  of  <2  years  from  the  most  recent  Td  were
evaluated in 
a retrospective survey of 4,524 health-care personnel who received Tdap at a median
age of 46 years during an outbreak 
of pertussis-like illness in New Hampshire in 2006 
(118,215,361). For the 2,676 (59%) responses, the rates of 
reactions were analyzed by interval from Td to Tdap as either >2 years (n = 1,792) or
<2 years (n = 370). The rates of pain, redness, or 
swelling of moderate or severe intensity, subjective fever, and medical visits were not
higher among respondents with an interval of <2 
years  between  administration  of  Td  and  that  of  Tdap.  Three  serious  adverse  events
were reported among adults who received Tdap 
at an interval >2 years after the most recent dose of Td; causality was not assessed.
The events were a case of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (not requiring hospitalization) with onset 11 days after Tdap, a
case of anaphylaxis-like reaction with onset 6 days 
after 
Tdap, and a case of eosinophilic nephritis with onset 6 days after Tdap in a health-care
worker with a history of a renal 
transplant (215,216).
Important Local Reactions
Arthus Reaction 
Arthus reaction (type III hypersensitivity reaction) can 
occur after tetanus toxoid-- or diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccines  (354,357,362--366;  CDC,  unpublished  data,  2005).  Arthus  reaction  is  a  local
vasculitis with deposition 
of  immune  complexes  and  activation  of  complement;  it  occurs  in  the  setting  of  high
local concentration of vaccine antigens 
and high circulating antibody concentration (354,362, 
363,367). The reaction is characterized by severe pain, swelling, 
induration, edema, and hemorrhage, and occasionally by local necrosis. Vaccine-related
arthus reaction typically resolves without 
sequelae. The onset of symptoms and signs is 4--12 hours after vaccination, compared
with anaphylaxis (immediate type 
I  hypersensitivity  reaction),  which  has  onset  within  minutes  after  vaccination.  ACIP
recommends that persons who 
experience an Arthus reaction after administration of a 
tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine not receive Td or other 
tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine more frequently than 
every 10 years, even for tetanus prophylaxis as part of wound management 
(1,357).
Extensive Limb Swelling 
Extensive limb swelling reactions have been reported to VAERS following administration
of Td 
(368,369) and are described following dose 4 or dose 5 of pediatric DTaP 
(23,208,368,370--373). Extensive limb swelling after pediatric DTaP 
resolves without complication within 4--7 days 
(370), and is not considered a precaution or contraindication for Tdap 
(23).
Neurologic and Systemic Events 
Pertussis Components 
Concerns  regarding  a  possible  role  of  pertussis  vaccine  components  in  causing
neurologic reactions or 
exacerbating underlying neurologic conditions in infants and children are long-standing 
(29,374). In 1991, the Institute of 
Medicine  (IOM)  concluded  that  evidence  favored  acceptance  of  a  causal  relation
between pediatric DTP vaccine and 
acute encephalopathy (365). A subsequent retrospective analysis of >2 million children
in the United States did not 
demonstrate that pediatric DTP was associated with an increased risk for 
encephalopathy after vaccination (375). Active surveillance 
in  Canada  during  1993--2002  also  failed  to  identify  any  acute  encephalopathy  cases
causally related to whole-cell or 
acellular  pertussis  vaccines  among  a  population  administered  6.5  million  doses  of
pertussis-containing vaccines 
(376). Results of one recent investigation suggested that some acute encephalopathies 
attributed previously to pertussis-containing vaccines could 
be the result of genetically determined epileptic encephalopathies related to mutations
in the sodium channel gene 
SCN1A (377,378). A history of encephalopathy (e.g., coma or prolonged seizures) not
attributable to an identifiable cause within 
7  days  of  administration  of  a  vaccine  with  pertussis  components  remains  a
contraindication for Tdap (but not Td) in adults 
and adolescents. 
The possibility that Tdap would complicate neurologic evaluation of chronic progressive
neurologic disorders that are 
stable in adults (e.g., dementia) is of limited clinical concern and does not constitute a
reason to delay administration of Tdap 
(1).  Unstable  or  evolving  neurologic  conditions  (e.g.,  cerebrovascular  events  or  acute
encephalopathic conditions) would be 
reason to delay administration of Tdap until the condition has stabilized 
(1). Among adolescents who have progressive 
or uncontrolled underlying neurologic disease, concerns regarding administering Tdap
must be weighed against the 
morbidity from pertussis, which could be severe 
(2). ACIP does not consider a history of well-controlled seizures or a family history 
of seizures (febrile or afebrile) or other neurologic disorder to be a contraindication or
precaution to vaccination with 
pertussis components (22).
Tetanus Toxoid Component 
ACIP  considers  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  within  6  weeks  after  receipt  of  a  tetanus
toxoid--containing vaccine to be 
a precaution (see Precautions and Reasons to Defer Td or 
Tdap) for administration of subsequent tetanus 
toxoid--containing  vaccines  (23).  Although  IOM  concluded  that  evidence  favored
acceptance of a causal relation between tetanus 
toxoid--containing vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome on the 
basis of a single well-documented case 
(365,379), subsequent 
analysis  of  data  from  both  adult  and  pediatric  populations  failed  to  demonstrate  an
association 
(380). As of January 29, 2007, eight patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome temporally
associated with receipt of Tdap or of Tdap administered on the 
same  day  with  other  vaccines  had  been  reported  to  VAERS.  The  onsets  were  not
clustered by the interval since vaccination or by 
a single pattern of vaccine exposure (361).
ACIP  does  not  consider  a  history  of  brachial  neuritis  to  be  a  precaution  or
contraindication for administration of 
tetanus  toxoid--containing  vaccines  (23,381).  IOM  concluded  that  evidence  from  case
reports and uncontrolled studies 
involving tetanus toxoid--containing vaccines did favor a causal 
relation between tetanus toxoid--containing vaccines and brachial 
neuritis (365); however, brachial neuritis typically is self-limited 
(23,381). Brachial neuritis is a compensable event through the 
Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) 
(365).
Economic Considerations
No  study  has  evaluated  the  disease  morbidity  and  societal  costs  associated  with
pertussis among pregnant women 
or  modeled  the  cost  benefit  or  cost  effectiveness  of  a  Tdap  strategy  that  includes
vaccination of pregnant women. The 
morbidity and societal cost of pertussis in adults is substantial 
(1,2). A retrospective assessment of medical costs of confirmed pertussis 
in  936  adults  in  Massachusetts  during  1998--2000,  and  a  prospective  assessment  of
nonmedical costs in 203 adults during 
2001--2003  (31)  indicated  that  the  mean  medical  and  nonmedical  cost  per  case  was
$326 and $447, respectively, for a societal 
cost of $773. If the cost of antimicrobials to treat contacts and the cost of personal time
were included, the 
societal cost could be as high as $1,952 per adult case (31).
Cost-benefit  and  cost-effectiveness  analyses  of  adult  Tdap  vaccination  have varied  in
their results 
(382,383).  When  discrepancies  in  the  models  were  addressed,  an  adult  Tdap
vaccination program was cost-effective when incidence of 
pertussis exceeded 120 cases per 100,000 population, using a benchmark of $50,000
per quality-adjusted life year saved 
(384--386). After adjusting for the severity of the illness at high disease incidence, little
effect was observed on the overall cost effectiveness of 
a vaccination program. Similar results were obtained when program costs and benefits
were analyzed over the lifetime of the 
adult cohort for decennial booster strategies 
(1,387).
Implementing Tdap
Preconception Assessments 
Administering  a  dose  of  Tdap  during  routine  wellness  visits  of  adult  and  adolescent
women of childbearing age, if 
indicated,  is  the  most  effective  programmatic  strategy  to  ensure  that  women  are
protected against pertussis in addition to tetanus 
and  diphtheria  and  minimizes  any  theoretical  effect  of  vaccination  on  infant  immune
responses should the woman 
become pregnant (see Immunity to Pertussis and Kinetics of 
Pertussis Booster Vaccination in Nonpregnant Adults and 
Adolescents)  (1,388--392).  Because  Tdap  contains  only  toxoids  and  purified  bacterial
components, women who receive Tdap do not 
need to wait after vaccination to become pregnant 
(23). Assessments provide repeated opportunities for documenting the history 
of  past  doses  of  Td  (or  TT)  and  any  serious  adverse  reactions  to  tetanus,  diphtheria,
and pertussis vaccines. To access 
and  maintain  immunization  records,  state-based  immunization  information  systems
(IIS) are increasingly becoming available 
to  clinicians  and  public  health  officials.  These  confidential,  computerized  information
systems, which consolidate 
vaccination data from multiple health-care providers, can generate reminder and 
recall notifications, assist with vaccine management 
and adverse events reporting, and capture lifespan vaccination histories 
(393). Additional guidance regarding administration 
of vaccines during routine assessments, record keeping, vaccine storage, and 
related topics has been published previously 
(23).
Prenatal Visits: Deferring Td During Pregnancy to Substitute Tdap in 
the Immediate Postpartum Period 
In 2004, a total of 96% of pregnant women started prenatal care in the first or second
trimester 
(394). Prenatal visits provide additional opportunities for assessing the history of past
vaccination with Tdap, Td, or TT and any 
serious adverse reactions to tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines. Women who
have not received a previous dose of Tdap can 
be 
advised that ACIP recommends Tdap postpartum before discharge from the hospital or
birthing center to provide 
personal protection and reduce the risk for transmitting pertussis to their infants.
Health-care  providers  can  monitor  pregnant  women  for  respiratory  illness  consistent
with pertussis or for recent exposure 
to  pertussis,  either  to  themselves  or  to  family  members,  and  prescribe  a  macrolide
antimicrobial for treatment of pertussis 
or  postexposure  prophylaxis,  if  indicated.  Women  and  their  partners  should  receive
counseling regarding the severity of 
infant  pertussis  and  ACIP's  recommendation  for  a  single  dose  of  Tdap  for  adults  and
adolescents who anticipate contact with 
an infant (1,2). In a 2005 national survey of obstetricians, 72% of respondents affirmed
the belief that 
obstetricians,  pediatricians,  adult  primary  care  providers,  and  public  health  providers
share responsibility to promote 
administration  of  Tdap  for  adults  who  anticipate  contact  with  an  infant,  including
fathers and close relatives 
(395).  Ideally,  health-care  providers  delivering  prenatal  care  will  encourage  persons
likely to have contact with an infant, including child care providers, to 
receive Tdap first. 
When  pregnant  women  who  have  not  received  Tdap  have  indications  for  tetanus  or
diphtheria booster 
protection (>10 years since the most recent Td), ACIP recommends 
receipt of Td during pregnancy (Table 2). ACIP has 
developed criteria for safely deferring administration of Td until delivery among women
who have received past tetanus 
toxoid--containing vaccinations, so the majority of these women can substitute Tdap in
the immediate postpartum period 
for Td during pregnancy (see Deferring Td During Pregnancy to Substitute Tdap in the
Immediate Postpartum Period). When 
the  history  of  tetanus  toxoid  vaccination  for  the  women  is  uncertain  or  lacking,
health-care providers can determine 
the  concentration  of  tetanus  antitoxin  to  ensure  protective  concentrations  of  tetanus
antitoxin 
(>0.1  IU/mL  by  ELISA).  Because  diphtheria  is  rare  in  the  United  States,  serologic
screening for diphtheria antitoxin typically is not necessary. A woman 
who anticipates travel to an area in which diphtheria is 
endemic can improve protection against diphtheria by receiving a 
booster dose of Td during pregnancy or a dose of Tdap postpartum. Serologic screening
to establish immunity to pertussis is 
not useful. 
In special situations in which a pregnant woman has 
increased risk for tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis, 
ACIP acknowledges that health-care providers may choose to 
administer Tdap instead of Td during pregnancy to add 
protection against pertussis, after discussing the theoretical benefits and risks for her,
her fetus, and the pregnancy outcome with 
the woman before vaccination (see Considerations for Use of Tdap in Pregnant Women
in Special Situations). Data to inform 
this decision are scarce. No theoretical risk for harm to the mother or fetus exists from
Tdap, and administration of Tdap in 
the pregnant woman might provide a degree of early protection to the infant against
pertussis. However, a theoretical risk for 
the  infant  is  that  the  dose  of  Tdap  in  pregnancy  might  not  result  in  early  protection
against pertussis or could 
increase  transplacental  pertussis-specific  antibodies  to  levels  that  would  have  a
negative effect on the infant's response to 
immunization with pediatric DTaP or with conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid
or diphtheria toxoid (e.g.,
Haemophilus influenzae type b pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) 
(222). Health-care providers who choose to vaccinate pregnant women with Tdap 
are encouraged to report such administration to the manufacturers' pregnancy registry.
Postpartum Tdap 
In  2004,  a  reported  99% of  live births  in  the United  States  occurred  in  a  hospital.  Of
out-of-hospital live births, 
27% occurred at a free-standing birthing center and 65% at a residence 
(394). In these settings, attendants can implement 
protocols  to  ensure  that  postpartum  women  who  have  not  received  Tdap  previously
receive it before discharge. They also can 
encourage previously unvaccinated adults and adolescents who anticipate contact with
an infant to receive Tdap. Tdap vaccination of 
the women and potential contacts before discharge rather than at a follow-up visit has
the advantage of decreasing the time 
when new mothers and contacts of the newborns could 
acquire and transmit pertussis to the infants 
(1,2).  Standing  orders  for  postpartum  Tdap  vaccination  before  discharge  have
successfully raised vaccination rates to more than 80% of 
eligible women (396). Although obtaining a history of the most recent Td vaccination
was anticipated to be a barrier to 
postpartum vaccination with Tdap, in practice it was not identified as a barrier 
(395,396).
Vaccination  of  parents  and  household  contacts  of  premature  infants  has  been
advocated to ensure that such persons 
receive  Tdap  (397).  Premature  and  low  birth  weight  infants  are  at  increased  risk  for
severe and complicated pertussis. The 
case-fatality rate for pertussis is increased compared with term infants, and premature
infants might respond less well than term infants 
to  initial  doses  of  DTaP  vaccine  because  of  comorbidities  or  treatments  (e.g.,
dexamethasone) 
(47,53, 398--403).
Parents should be reminded of other measures to protect infants from pertussis. To the
extent feasible, parents can 
limit infant exposures to persons who have respiratory illness until they are determined
to be noninfectious 
(99,219,321).  When  pertussis  exposure  occurs,  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  of  exposed
contacts can be effective in preventing transmission 
of pertussis (42,99,404,405). Ensuring that infants begin the pediatric DTaP vaccination
series at the recommended chronologic age of 
6--8 weeks is critical to protection and reducing the severity of pertussis 
(8,45,397,406). Administration of 2 or 3 doses of pediatric 
DTP or DTaP can prevent hospitalization for pertussis and its complications 
(5,8,407--409).
Recommendations
Recommendations for routine use of Td and Tdap among women of childbearing age
who might become pregnant 
have been published previously (1,2) and have been summarized (Table 2). Women are
encouraged to receive a single dose of 
Tdap either as ADACEL® (adults and adolescents aged 
11--64 years) or as BOOSTRIX® (adolescents aged 11--18 years) 
before conception (e.g., during routine wellness visits) if they have not already received
Tdap. Recommendations for adults 
and  adolescents  who  anticipate  or  have  household  contact  with  an  infant  aged  <12
months also have been published 
previously (1,2) and summarized (Table 2). The dose of Tdap will provide active booster
immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, 
and pertussis and will replace the next dose of Td 
according to routine recommendations. A single preconception dose of Tdap 
will  prevent  pertussis,  reduce  morbidity  associated  with  pertussis,  and  might  prevent
exposing persons at increased risk 
for pertussis and its complications, including infants. The risk for pertussis death and
severe pertussis is highest among infants 
in the first months of life and remains elevated until an infant has received 1--2 doses
of 
pediatric DTaP (8,45,47).
The  following  sections  present  recommendations  for  use  of  Td  and  Tdap  among
pregnant and postpartum 
women,  including  routine  vaccination,  contraindications,  precautions,  and  special
situations. As with most inactivated vaccines 
and toxoids, pregnancy is not a contraindication for use of Tdap. Although the safety
and immunogenicity of Tdap is expected 
to be similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women, few data on the safety of Tdap for
women, fetuses, and pregnancy 
outcomes are available, and no information is available on the immunogenicity of Tdap
in pregnant women. Vaccinating 
pregnant  women  with  a  single  dose  of  Tdap  might  provide  a  degree  of  protection
against pertussis to the infant in early life 
through  transplacental  maternal  antibody,  but  evidence  supporting  this  hypothesis  is
lacking. A concern is the unknown effect 
of potential interference by maternal antibody on the ability of the infant to mount an
adequate immune response when 
the infant receives pediatric DTaP or conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or
diphtheria toxoid.
In special situations, administration of Tdap during pregnancy might be warranted for
pregnant women who were 
not  vaccinated  previously  with  Tdap.  Health-care  providers  who  choose  to  administer
Tdap to pregnant women should 
discuss with the women the potential risks and benefits of 
immunization including the lack of data on Tdap administered 
during pregnancy or its unknown effects on active immunization 
of their infant. The following recommendations are intended 
to provide guidance to clinicians until additional information is available. 
1. Routine Tdap Vaccination 
1-A. Recommendations for Use of Postpartum Tdap 
For  women  who  have  not  received  Tdap  previously  (including  women  who  are
breastfeeding), Tdap is recommended 
as  soon  as  feasible  in  the  immediate  postpartum  period  to  protect  the  women  from
pertussis and reduce the risk for 
exposing their infants to pertussis. The postpartum Tdap should be administered before
discharge from the hospital or birthing 
center.  If  Tdap  cannot  be  administered  at  or  before  discharge,  the  dose  should  be
administered as soon as feasible thereafter. 
Elevated levels of pertussis antibodies in the mother are likely within 1--2 weeks after
vaccination.
Although  an  interval  of  10  years  since  receipt  of  the  most  recent  Td  dose  is
recommended for the next routine Td 
booster, to reduce the risk for women exposing their infants to pertussis, an interval as
short as 2 years 
between the most recent Td and administering 
Tdap¶ is suggested for postpartum women. The safety of such an interval is supported
by three 
Canadian  studies  among  adolescents  and  by  a  study  among  nonpregnant  adult
health-care personnel 
(215,358--360),  an  interval  shorter  than  2  years  may  be  used  (see  Postpartum  Tdap
When <2 Years Have Elapsed Since the Most Recent Td). In this setting, 
the benefit of Tdap to protect against pertussis typically outweighs the risk for local and
systemic reactions after 
vaccination. 
Routine  postpartum  Tdap  recommendations  are  supported  by  evidence  from
randomized controlled clinical 
trials,  nonrandomized  open-label  trials  and  a  retrospective  survey,  observational
studies, and 
expert opinion (Box 2).
1-B. Dosage and Administration 
The dose of Tdap or, if indicated, the dose of Td is 0.5 mL, administered intramuscularly
(IM), preferably into 
the deltoid muscle. 
1-C. Simultaneous Vaccination with Tdap and Other Vaccines 
If two or more vaccines are indicated, they typically should be administered during the
same visit (i.e., 
simultaneous  vaccination).  Each  vaccine  should  be  administered  using  a  separate
syringe at a different anatomic site. Certain 
experts recommend administering no more than two injections per muscle, separated
by at least one inch. Administering all 
indicated  vaccines  during  a  single  visit  increases  the  likelihood  that  pregnant  and
postpartum women will receive 
recommended vaccinations (23). 
1-D. Interchangeable Use of Tdap Vaccines 
A single dose of ADACEL® may be used for adults aged 19--64 years, and a single dose
of either 
ADACEL® or 
BOOSTRIX® may be used for adolescents aged 11--18 years, regardless of the type or
manufacturer of pediatric DTP 
or pediatric DTaP used for childhood vaccination. 
1-E. Preventing Adverse Events 
Attention  to  proper  immunization  technique,  including  use  of  an  appropriate  needle
length and standard routes 
of administration (i.e., IM for Td and Tdap) might minimize the risk for adverse events.
Guidance for administration of 
vaccines is available (23).
Syncope can occur after vaccination and might be more common among young adults
and adolescents than among 
other age groups. Syncope rarely has resulted in serious injury 
(23,410--412). Vaccine providers should strongly consider 
observing patients for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated 
(23,412). If syncope occurs, patients should be observed 
until symptoms resolve.
1-F. Inadvertent Administration of Pediatric DTaP, 
BOOSTRIX® Tdap, or Purified 
Protein Derivative (PPD) 
The potential for administration errors involving tetanus toxoid--containing vaccines 
(413) and other vaccines is well-documented 
(414--416). Pediatric DTaP and pediatric diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid vaccine
(DT) 
formulations  indicated  for  use  in  children  aged  6  weeks--6  years  should  not  be
administered to adults or adolescents; these vaccines can 
be associated with more severe local reactions than adult formulations 
(350,417). Packaging of adult and adolescent 
Tdap  vaccines,  pediatric  DTaP,  and  purified  protein  derivative  (PPD)  might  appear
similar. Only one formulation of 
Tdap, ADACEL,® is licensed and recommended for adults aged 
19--64 years. Both formulations of Tdap 
(BOOSTRIX® and 
ADACEL®) are licensed and recommended for adolescents aged 11--18 years. Providers
should review product 
labels before administering these vaccines. If pediatric DTaP is 
administered inadvertently to an adult or adolescent, or 
if BOOSTRIX® is administered inadvertently to an adult aged 
>19 years, the dose should be counted as the Tdap dose, and 
the  person  should  not  receive  an  additional  dose  of  Tdap.  Adults  or  adolescents  who
receive PPD instead of Tdap should receive 
a dose of Tdap. 
1-G. Record Keeping 
Health-care providers who administer vaccines to adults and adolescents are required
to keep permanent vaccination 
records of vaccines covered under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation
Act. ACIP has recommended that 
this practice include all vaccines (23). Encouraging adults and adolescents to maintain
a personal vaccination record 
is  important  to  minimize  administration  of  unnecessary  vaccinations.  Ideally,  the
personal vaccine record will document the 
type of the vaccine, manufacturer, anatomic site, route, and date of administration, and
the name of the administering facility 
(23).
2. Contraindications and Precautions for Use of Td and Tdap 
2-A. Contraindications 
The following conditions are contraindications for Td or Tdap: 
Td and Tdap are contraindicated for persons with a history of serious allergic reaction
(i.e., anaphylaxis) to 
any  component  of  the  vaccine.  Because  of  the  importance  of  tetanus  vaccination,
persons with a history of anaphylaxis 
to components included in any Td or Tdap vaccines should be referred to an allergist to
determine whether they have 
a specific allergy to tetanus toxoid and whether they can safely receive TT vaccination.
Tdap  (but  not  Td)  is  contraindicated  for  adults  and  adolescents  with  a  history  of
encephalopathy (e.g., coma or 
prolonged  seizures)  not  attributable  to  an  identifiable  cause  within  7  days  of
administration of a vaccine with pertussis 
components. This contraindication is for the pertussis components, and these persons
should receive Td instead of Tdap.
2-B. Precautions and Reasons to Defer Td or Tdap 
A  precaution  is  a  condition  in  a  vaccine  recipient  that  might  increase  the  risk  for  a
serious adverse reaction 
(23).  In  the  following  situations,  vaccine  providers  should  evaluate  the  risks  and
benefits of administering Td or Tdap:
Guillain-Barré  syndrome  with  onset  <6  weeks  after  previous  dose  of  a  tetanus
toxoid--containing vaccine;
moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever until the acute illness resolves;
history of an Arthus reaction (see Important Local 
Reactions) after a previous dose of a tetanus 
toxoid--containing  and/or  diphtheria  toxoid--containing  vaccine,  including  MCV4.  The
vaccine provider should review the patient's medical 
history  to  verify  the  diagnosis  of  Arthus  reaction  and  consult  with  an  allergist  or
immunologist. If an Arthus reaction was 
likely, vaccine providers should consider deferring Td or Tdap vaccination until at 
least  10  years  have  elapsed  since  the  last  tetanus  toxoid--  or  diphtheria
toxoid--containing vaccine was received. If the Arthus reaction was associated with a 
vaccine that contained diphtheria toxoid without tetanus toxoid (e.g., MCV4), deferring 
Td or Tdap might leave the adult or adolescent woman and her neonate unprotected
against tetanus. In this situation, if the last tetanus 
toxoid--containing  vaccine  was  administered  >10  years  previously,  vaccine  providers
may obtain a serum tetanus antitoxin level to 
evaluate the need for tetanus vaccination (tetanus antitoxin levels 
>0.1 IU/mL by ELISA are considered protective) or 
administer TT; and 
Tdap (but not Td) for adults aged 19--64 years with 
unstable neurologic conditions (e.g., cerebrovascular events or 
acute  encephalopathic  conditions)  (1)  and  adolescents  aged  11--18  years  with  any
progressive neurologic disorder 
including progressive encephalopathy, or uncontrolled epilepsy (until the condition has
stabilized) 
(2) (see Neurologic and Systemic Events). 
2-C. Conditions Under Which Td or Tdap May Be Administered If Otherwise Indicated
The following conditions are not contraindications or precautions for Td or Tdap:
stable  neurologic  disorder,  including  well-controlled  seizures,  a  history  of  a  seizure
disorder that has resolved, or 
cerebral palsy; 
brachial  neuritis  after  a  previous  dose  of  tetanus  toxoid--  or  diphtheria  toxoid--
containing vaccine;
a history of an extensive limb swelling reaction that was not an Arthus hypersensitivity
reaction after pediatric DTP 
or DTaP or after Td; 
immunosuppression, including persons with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (the immunogenicity of Tdap 
in persons with immunosuppression has not been studied and could be suboptimal);
breastfeeding;
intercurrent minor illness; and 
use of antimicrobials.
Latex  allergies  other  than  anaphylactic  allergies  (e.g.,  a  history  of  contact  allergy  to
latex gloves) are not a contraindication 
or precaution to Tdap (417). The tip and rubber plunger of the 
BOOSTRIX® needleless syringe contain latex. 
The BOOSTRIX® single dose vial and 
ADACEL® preparations contain no latex. Certain Td products contain latex. The 
package inserts should be consulted for details (Table 1).
3. Special Situations
3-A. Deferring Td during Pregnancy to Substitute 
Tdap in the Immediate Postpartum Period 
Tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination is recommended for pregnant women if 
>10 years have elapsed since the previous Td vaccination 
(1,2).  To  add  protection  against  pertussis,  health-care  providers  may  defer  the  Td
vaccination 
during  pregnancy  to  substitute  Tdap  as  soon  as  feasible  postpartum  if  the  woman  is
likely to have sufficient tetanus and 
diphtheria protection until delivery. 
Sufficient tetanus protection is likely if:
a  pregnant  woman  aged  <31  years  has  received  a  complete  childhood  series  of
immunization (4--5 doses of 
pediatric DTP, DTaP, and DT) and >1 Td booster dose during adolescence or as an adult
(a primary series consisting of 3 doses of Td 
(or  TT)  administered  during  adolescence  or  as  an  adult  substitutes  for  the  childhood
series of 
immunization),** 
a  pregnant  woman  aged  >31  years  has  received  a  complete  childhood  series  of
immunization (4--5 doses of 
pediatric DTP, DTaP, and/or DT) and >2 Td booster doses,
a  primary  series  consisting  of  3  doses  of  Td  (or  TT)  was  administered  during
adolescence or as an adult substitute for 
the childhood series of immunization,** or 
a pregnant woman has a protective level of serum tetanus antitoxin 
(>0.1 IU/mL by ELISA). 
A woman should receive Td during pregnancy if she
does  not  have  sufficient  tetanus  immunity  to  protect  against  maternal  and  neonatal
tetanus, or
requires  urgent  booster  protection  against  diphtheria  (e.g.,  for  travel  to  an  area  in
which diphtheria is 
endemic††).
Alternatively, health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap instead of Td during
pregnancy (see Considerations 
for Use of Tdap in Pregnant Women in Special Situations). 
3-B. Postpartum Tdap When <2 Years Have Elapsed Since the Most Recent Td
Certain postpartum women (e.g., those who have received Td or TT within 2 years of
the immediate postpartum 
period)  might  benefit  from  Tdap  for  pertussis  protection.  Few  subjects  have  been
evaluated to determine the risk for adverse local 
and systemic reactions after Tdap at intervals <2 years since the most recent Td (or
other tetanus toxoid-- or diphtheria 
toxoid--containing  vaccine)  (215).  After  obtaining  a  history  to  exclude  women  with
moderate or severe adverse reactions 
following  previous  doses,  health-care  providers  may  choose  to  administer  Tdap  in
postpartum women who 
received tetanus toxoid-- or diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccine§§ <2 years previously (see Precautions and Reasons to Defer Td and Tdap).
Health-care  providers  should  encourage  vaccination  of  household  and  child  care
provider contacts of infants aged 
<12  months  for  protection  against  pertussis,  according  to  current  recommendations
(Table 2) 
(1,2). Women should be advised of the symptoms of pertussis and the effectiveness of
early antimicrobial prophylaxis for themselves, their infant, and members 
of their household, if pertussis is suspected 
(127).
3-C. History of Pertussis 
Postpartum women who have a history of pertussis should receive Tdap according to
the routine recommendation 
(see Recommendations for Use of Postpartum Tdap). This practice is preferred because
the duration of protection induced 
by pertussis is unknown (waning might begin as early as 5--10 years after infection) 
(4), and a diagnosis of pertussis often is 
not  reliably  confirmed.  Administering  pertussis  vaccine  to  persons  with  a  history  of
pertussis presents no theoretical 
safety concern. 
3-D. Considerations for Use of Tdap in Pregnant 
Women in Special Situations 
ACIP  recommends  administration  of  Td  for  booster  protection  against  tetanus  and
diphtheria in pregnant 
women. However, health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap instead of Td
during pregnancy to add protection 
against pertussis in special situations. In these situations, the pregnant woman should
be informed of the lack of data confirming 
the safety and immunogenicity of Tdap in pregnant women, the unknown potential for
early protection of the infant 
against pertussis by transplacental maternal antibodies, and the possible adverse effect
of maternal antibodies on the ability of 
the  infant  to  mount  an  adequate  immune  response  to  antigens  in  pediatric  DTaP  or
conjugate vaccines containing tetanus 
toxoid or diphtheria toxoid. 
Special situations in which Tdap might be used might 
include instances when 
a pregnant woman has insufficient tetanus or diphtheria protection until delivery, or 
a pregnant woman is at increased risk for pertussis. 
Persons  at  increased  risk  for  pertussis  might  include  adolescents  aged  11--18  years,
health-care personnel, and 
women employed in institutions in which a pertussis outbreak is 
occurring or living in a community in which a pertussis outbreak 
is occurring. 
Adverse pregnancy outcomes are most common in the first trimester 
(418). To minimize the perception of an association 
of  vaccine  with  an  adverse  outcome,  vaccinating  with  tetanus  toxoid--containing
vaccines during the second or third trimester 
is preferred. 
Because  information  on  the  use  of  Tdap  in  pregnant  women  is  lacking,  both
manufacturers of Tdap have established 
a pregnancy registry. Health-care providers are encouraged to 
report vaccination of pregnant women with Tdap, regardless 
of trimester, to the appropriate manufacturer's registry. For 
ADACEL,® vaccination should be reported to sanofi 
pasteur, telephone 1-800-822-2463 (1-800-VACCINE), and for 
BOOSTRIX,® vaccination should be reported to 
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, telephone 1-888-825-5249. 
3-E. Tetanus Prophylaxis for Wound Management 
ACIP has recommended administering tetanus 
toxoid--containing vaccine and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) as part 
of standard wound management to prevent tetanus 
(Table 11) (357). A Td booster might be recommended for 
wound  management  in  pregnant  women  if  5  years  or  more  have  elapsed  since  the
previous Td 
(1,2). Health-care providers may choose to substitute Tdap for Td during pregnancy in
these women (see Considerations for Use of Tdap in Pregnant 
Women in Special Situations). For pregnant women vaccinated previously with Tdap, Td
should be used if a tetanus 
toxoid--containing  vaccine  is  indicated  for  wound  care.  Pregnant  women  who  have
completed the 3-dose primary tetanus 
vaccination  series  and  have  received  a  tetanus  toxoid--containing  vaccine  within  the
preceding 5 years are protected against tetanus and 
do not require a tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine as part of wound management.
To avoid unnecessary vaccination, health-care providers should attempt to determine
whether the woman has completed 
the  3-dose  primary  tetanus  vaccination  series.  Pregnant  women  with  unknown  or
uncertain previous tetanus vaccination 
histories should be considered to have had no prior tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine
and they should complete a 3-dose 
primary series of immunization to prevent maternal and neonatal tetanus (see Pregnant
Women with Unknown or Incomplete 
Tetanus  Vaccination).  Pregnant  women  who  have  not  completed  the  primary  series
might require tetanus toxoid and 
passive vaccination with TIG at the time of wound management (Table 11). When both
TIG and a tetanus 
toxoid--containing vaccine are indicated, each product should be administered using a
separate syringe at different anatomic sites. 
Pregnant  women  with  a  history  of  Arthus  reaction  after  a  previous  dose  of  a  tetanus
toxoid--containing vaccine should not receive 
a tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine until 10 years or more after the most recent dose,
even if they have a wound that is 
neither  clean  nor  minor.  If  the  Arthus  reaction  was  associated  with  a  vaccine  that
contained diphtheria toxoid without tetanus 
toxoid  (e.g.,  MCV4),  deferring  Td  or  Tdap  might  leave  the  pregnant  women
inadequately protected against tetanus, and TT 
should  be  administered  (see  Precautions  and  Reasons  to  Defer  Td  or  Tdap).  In  all
circumstances, the decision to administer TIG 
is based on the primary vaccination history for tetanus (Table 11). 
3-F. Pregnant Women with Unknown or Incomplete 
Tetanus Vaccination 
Pregnant women who never have been vaccinated against tetanus (i.e., have received
no dose of pediatric DTP, DTaP, or 
DT or of adult Td or TT) should receive a series of three vaccinations containing tetanus
and diphtheria toxoids starting 
during  pregnancy  to  ensure  protection  against  maternal  and  neonatal  tetanus.  A
primary series consists of a first dose administered 
as soon as feasible, a second dose at least 4 weeks later, and a third dose 6 calendar
months after the second dose. If 
feasible,  pregnant  women  who  have  received  fewer  than  3  doses  of  tetanus
toxoid--containing vaccine should complete the 
3-dose  primary  series  during  pregnancy.  Td  is  preferred  for  the  doses  during
pregnancy. Health-care providers may choose 
to substitute a single dose of Tdap for 1 dose of Td during pregnancy and complete the
series with Td. In such cases, the 
women  should  be  informed  of  the  lack  of  data  on  safety,  immunogenicity,  and
pregnancy outcomes for pregnant women who 
receive  Tdap  (see  Considerations  for  Use  of  Tdap  in  Pregnant  Women  in  Special
Situations).
Reporting Adverse Events after Vaccination 
As  with  any  newly  licensed  vaccine,  surveillance  for  rare  adverse  events  associated
with administration of Tdap 
is important for assessing its safety in large-scale use. The 
National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires 
health-care providers to report specific adverse events that follow tetanus, diphtheria,
or pertussis vaccination. A table of reportable 
events following vaccination is available from VAERS at
http://vaers.hhs.gov/reportable.htm. All clinically significant adverse 
events should be reported to VAERS even if causal relation to vaccination is not certain.
VAERS reporting forms and information 
are
 available
 electronically
 at
 http://www.vaers.hhs.gov
 or
 by
 telephone,
1-800-822-7967. 
To promote better timeliness and quality of safety data, providers are encouraged to
report electronically by using web-based reporting 
(https://secure.vaers.orgVaersDataEntryintro.htm). 
Vaccine Injury Compensation Program 
VICP is a system established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 that
enables compensation to be 
paid on behalf of a person thought to have been injured or died as a result of receiving
a vaccine covered by the program. 
Anyone receiving a covered vaccine, regardless of age, can file a petition under VICP.
The program is intended as an alternative to 
civil litigation under the traditional tort system because negligence need not be proven.
The  Act  establishes  1)  a  vaccine  injury  table  that  lists  the  vaccines  covered  by  the
program; 2) the injuries, disabilities, 
and conditions (including death) for which compensation might be paid without proof of
causation; and 3) the period 
after vaccination during which the first symptom or substantial aggravation of the injury
must appear. Persons might 
be  compensated  for  an  injury  listed  in  the  table  or  one  that  can  be  demonstrated  to
result from administration of a listed 
vaccine.  All  tetanus  toxoid--containing  vaccines  and  vaccines  with  pertussis
components (e.g., Tdap, Td, and pediatric DTaP) 
are covered under the Act. Additional information regarding the program is available at 
http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine compensation or by telephone, 1-800-338-2382. 
Areas for Future Research 
Interest in vaccinating pregnant women to prevent infant pertussis declined in the late
1940s when whole-cell vaccine 
trials  demonstrated  pertussis-specific  antibodies  in  as  many  as  75%  of  infants
vaccinated starting at birth or in the first few 
months of life (38,186,188,218,237) and infant and childhood vaccination was adopted
as the primary national strategy 
for protection against childhood diseases 
(419,420). Aside from initiatives to eliminate neonatal tetanus and more recently 
to  prevent  influenza  during  pregnancy,  limited  attention  has  been  focused  on
vaccinating pregnant women as a strategy 
to prevent disease in the women and their infants during the first few months of life 
(290,421--430). A major barrier to conducting vaccine trials in pregnant women is the
potential liability from expected adverse pregnancy outcomes that 
might be related temporally to vaccination 
(388,431,432). However, the high morbidity and mortality of certain infections 
that  affect  pregnant  women  and  neonates  warrant  renewed  consideration  of  the
strategy of vaccinating pregnant women.
Ensuring the safety of vaccination for mother and fetus and for pregnancy outcomes is
a public health priority. In 
addition,  important  considerations  include  understanding  whether  a  degree  of
protection might be achieved for the mother and for 
her newborn by vaccinating during pregnancy, whether maternal vaccination would be
required with each pregnancy to 
achieve  these  benefits  (if  any),  and  whether  change  in  the  levels  of  transplacental
maternal antibody might affect infant responses 
to  routine  vaccination  (159,222,224,228).  Because  few  vaccines  are  currently
recommended for pregnant women (e.g., Td 
and influenza), the effects of the transplacental maternal 
antibodies on the subsequent infant responses to routine vaccination 
with  the  same  antigens  are  not  known  for  most  vaccines.  Change  in  the  levels  of
transplacental antibody can affect 
infant susceptibility to disease at a population level. For example, a decrease over time
in the level of transplacental maternal 
antibody  from  women  who  were  immunized  with  measles  vaccine  during  childhood
(rather than by measles disease) resulted 
in susceptibility to measles among their infants at an earlier age, and to the decision to
recommend infant measles vaccination 
at age 12 months rather than age 15--18 months in the United States 
(228,433,434).
Major  gaps  exist  in  the  knowledge  of  how  best  to  prevent  pertussis  in  early  infancy.
These include 1) the safety of 
pertussis vaccines for pregnant women, their fetuses, and pregnancy outcomes; 2) the
immunogenicity of acellular pertussis vaccines 
in 
pregnant women and transplacental maternal antibodies with respect to the timing of
immunization during pregnancy; 3) 
the  degree  and  duration  of  protection  against  pertussis  in  early  infancy  through
transplacental maternal antibodies; and 4) 
the  effects  of  transplacental  maternal  antibodies  (induced  by  pertussis,  DTP,  DTaP,
and/or Tdap) on the infant responses to 
active  immunization  with  pediatric  DTaP  and  conjugate  vaccines  containing  tetanus
toxoid or diphtheria 
toxoid  (159,222,234,235,435).  To  understand  the  range  of  options  for  protecting
women and infants from pertussis, studies 
are  needed  to  determine  the  safety  and  any  benefits  of  accelerated  infant  pertussis
vaccination schedules or dosing (e.g., 
pertussis  vaccination  starting  at  birth  or  employing  acellular  vaccines  that  do  not
contain diphtheria toxoid and tetanus 
toxoid)
 (221,436,437).
 Alternative
 infant
 vaccination
 strategies
 examined
independently or in conjunction with vaccinating 
pregnant women will determine the most effective and practical approaches to reduce
the morbidity and mortality of pertussis.

  This report discusses certain situations in which health-care providers might choose to
administer Tdap to a 
pregnant woman. Health-care providers should weigh the theoretical risks and benefits
before choosing to administer Tdap vaccine to 
a pregnant woman.  During June 2006, ACIP evaluated the limited evidence available
concerning safety, immunogenicity, and 
pregnancy  outcomes  after  administration  of  Tdap;  evidence  from  historic  use  of
pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria vaccines in 
pregnant women; and the potential effects of transplacental maternal antibody on the
infant's immune response to active 
immunization  with  pediatric  diphtheria  and  tetanus  toxoids  and  whole-cell  pertussis
(DTP) or DTaP vaccines, or to conjugate 
vaccines  containing  tetanus  toxoid  or  diphtheria  toxoid.  The  evaluation  included  a
synthesis of information from scientific 
literature  published  in  English,  unpublished  sources  of  information,  consultations,
analyses, and extensive discussion by an 
ACIP  working  group†  during  2005--2006.  The  working  group  comprised  persons  with
expertise in pertussis, tetanus, 
and  diphtheria;  obstetrics  and  gynecology;  pediatrics,  family  practice,  internal
medicine, immunology, public health, and 
vaccine regulation; and liaison members from partner 
organizations.   The  workgroup  considered  multiple  diverse  views  on  the  adequacy  of
evidence needed to form a recommendation for use 
of Tdap in pregnant and postpartum women. A minority view held that available data
from nonpregnant women and men, 
and  experience  with  the  use  of  Td  in  pregnant  women  to  prevent  neonatal  and
maternal tetanus, were sufficient to support 
a recommendation for the safe use of Tdap in pregnant women for individual protection
from pertussis. The 
majority view, while acknowledging the desirability of preventing pertussis in pregnant
women and the substantial body of 
information  demonstrating  the  usefulness  of  Td  to  prevent  maternal  and  neonatal
tetanus, held that the evidence was 
insufficient at this time to support a recommendation for 
routine administration of Tdap in pregnant women. The specific issues for 
pertussis  differ  from  those  for  tetanus  and  diphtheria.  Important  among  these  is  the
limited understanding of immunity and 
correlates of protection for pertussis. In 
addition, data supporting the safety of vaccinating pregnant women with Tdap to 
prevent  pertussis  are  scarce  for  women,  their  fetuses,  and  pregnancy  outcomes.
Whether transplacental maternal antibody exerts 
an  inhibitory  or  other  effect  on  the  infant-protective  immune  response  to  active
immunization with pediatric DTaP or 
conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or diphtheria toxoid has not been studied.
Protection against infant pertussis 
through  Tdap-induced  transplacental  maternal  antibody  has  not  been  demonstrated.
Until additional information is available, 
the majority view of the working group held that Tdap administered to women in the
immediate postpartum period, in 
addition  to  ensuring  pertussis  vaccination  of  close  contacts,  would  likely  provide  a
measure of protection for mother and infant.
 B. pertussis, the organism that causes 
pertussis, elaborates multiple toxins, including tracheal cytotoxin, which damages 
the respiratory epithelial tissue in vitro 
(24), and pertussis toxin, which has systemic effects (e.g., promoting lymphocytosis) 
(25). Illnesses caused by other species of Bordetella are not considered preventable by
available pertussis vaccines 
(26,27).
 Clinical Features  B. pertussis infections and reinfections among adults and adolescents
can be asymptomatic or range from a mild 
cough illness to the severe, prolonged cough illness of classic pertussis 
(28). The clinical presentation of pertussis can be similar 
to that for respiratory illness caused by B. parapertussis, 
B. bronchiseptica, B. holmseii, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae, Chlamydia (Chlamydophila) pneumoniae, and multiple viral agents (e.g.,
adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, 
human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus). The incubation
period for pertussis typically is 7--10 
days (range: 5--21 days) (29,30).
 Classic  pertussis  is  characterized  by  three  phases:  catarrhal,  paroxysmal,  and
convalescent 
(28,29). The catarrhal phase lasts 1--2 weeks and consists of a watery nasal discharge
and frequent cough, frequent sneezing, and injection of the 
conjunctiva,  often  with  lacrimation.  The  cough  typically  suggests  tracheal  irritation
(e.g., a tickle in the throat) and is short, sharp, 
hacking,  and  isolated  (as  distinguished  from  paroxysmal).  The  cough  is  equally
persistent during day and night and rarely croupy 
or  hoarse.  Fever  is  uncommon  during  any  phase  unless  the  illness  is  complicated  by
secondary infection or coinfection 
(28).  The  paroxysmal  phase  lasts  2--6  weeks.  The  patient  has  intermittent  periods  of
intense coughing (paroxysms) alternating 
with periods of appearing relatively well with a normal respiratory rate. The paroxysms
are characterized by spasms of 
coughing, choking, posttussive vomiting, and inspiratory whoop 
(29,31). Adults experience greater severity 
of  illness  than  adolescents,  including  cough-related  incontinence  in  28%  of  cases  in
women; in up to 5% of cases, adults and adolescents experience 
one 
or more rib fracture, syncope, or pneumonia, or they require hospitalizations 
(1,2,31,32). Approximately one third of 
adults and adolescents lose weight during the illness 
(31,33). Anecdotal reports of pneumothorax, seizures, stroke, and 
other complications have been summarized previously 
(1,34). The convalescent phase of pertussis typically lasts 2--6 weeks 
(35). Symptoms can persist for >6 months 
(1,2). Factors that can lessen the severity of 
B. pertussis infection include 
residual  immunity  from  previous  infection  or  vaccination  and  use  of  macrolide
antimicrobials in the catarrhal (early) phase of 
the illness (36).
 Adults and adolescents with pertussis make repeated medical visits and miss work and
school. During 1998--2000 
in Massachusetts, among 936 adults and 1,679 adolescents 
reported with confirmed pertussis, the median number of 
medical visits was two (range: 0--15) (31). Among 203 adults and 314 adolescents with
confirmed pertussis who 
were interviewed during 2001--2003, 158 (78%) adults were 
employed. Of these employed adults, 123 (78%) missed work 
(mean:  9.8  days;  range:  0.1--180  days);  261  of  the  314  (83%)  adolescents  missed
school (mean: 5.5 days; range: 0.4--32 
days). Among primary caregivers for adolescents, 136 of 
314 (43%) missed work (mean: 2.4 days; range: 0.1--25 days); a 
second caregiver in 53 families also missed work (mean: 1.8 days; range: 0.1--11 days) 
(31).
 Pertussis is transmitted from person to person via large respiratory droplets generated
by coughing or sneezing; 
early reports suggested that B. pertussis can be recovered from dried mucus for up to 3
days 
(28,30). Pertussis is highly 
infectious, with attack rates among exposed, nonimmune household contacts as high as
80%--90% 
(29,37,38). The most infectious periods are the catarrhal and early paroxysmal phases 
(28). Untreated patients, particularly infants, remain infectious for 
6 weeks or longer (29). Among older children and adults with previous vaccination or
infection, the infectious period typically 
is <21 days (29).
 In a Canadian study conducted in 1999, a source was identified in 60%--70% of adults
and adolescents with 
pertussis. Among adults aged 18--39 years, the source was a person in the household in
25%--44% of cases or at work or school 
in 17%--25% of cases. Among adolescents aged 12--17 years, the source was a person
in the household in 9% of cases and 
a friend or person at school or work in 51% of cases 
(39).
 Pertussis During Pregnancy  Case reports suggest that the morbidity of pertussis is not
increased among pregnant women compared with 
nonpregnant  women.  In  a  general  medical  practice  during  1979--1980,  four  pregnant
women had onset of cough during the 12th, 
14th, 14th, and 36th week of gestation and cough that lasted 36, 6, 8, and 6 weeks,
respectively; two women had vomiting 
after  coughing  and  worsening  cough  paroxysms  at  night;  and  one  woman  developed
hemoptysis and subconjunctival 
hemorrhage after repeated and forceful coughing paroxysms 
(40). A 1993 case report described a pregnant woman who was hospitalized 
6 days before delivery for severe paroxysms and posttussive emesis 
(41). In a series of 32 women who had pertussis 
during pregnancy or at term, the illness was characterized as "a very tiresome disease";
no obstetric complication was reported, and 
no  infant  was  premature  (42).  No  pertussis-related  deaths  have  been  reported  in
pregnant women. The source of pertussis 
in  infected  pregnant  women  has  not  been  examined  systematically.   Reports  of  fetal
morbidity among pregnant women with pertussis are rare, and no causal relationship
with abnormal 
fetal  development,  fetal  morbidity,  or  adverse  outcome  of  pregnancy  has  been
confirmed. One fetus of a mother who had 
severe paroxysmal coughing early in pregnancy had an extradural hematoma that was
identified by ultrasonography and 
magnetic  resonance  at  31  weeks'  gestation;  studies  had  been  normal  at  12  and  22
weeks' gestation 
(43).  Another  fetus  of  a  mother  who  had  pertussis  during  the  first  trimester  had
prenatal diagnosis of laryngotracheal obstruction 
(44).
 Infantile Pertussis  Infants aged <12 months typically have the most severe pertussis,
often requiring hospitalization for respiratory or 
other complications (Table 3) (8,45--49). The risk for pertussis death or severe pertussis
is highest among infants in the first 
6 months of life and remains elevated until infants have received 
1--2 doses of pediatric DTaP 
(8,50,51). During 2000--2006, the average annual incidence of pertussis among infants
aged 
<6 months was 111 cases per 100,000 population; for 
infants  aged  6--11  months,  incidence  was  19  cases  per  100,000  population  (CDC,
unpublished data, 2007).
 Complications  and  deaths  from  infant  pertussis  have  been  characterized  by
necrotizing bronchiolitis 
(52)  and  high  rates  of  primary  or  secondary  pneumonia  and/or  coinfection  with
bacterial and viral pathogens 
(8,28,47,53). Since 1993, pulmonary 
hypertension has been increasingly recognized among fatal infant cases 
(47,52,54--58). The majority of all infant deaths 
have occurred among unvaccinated infants 
(47,53,58; CDC, unpublished data, 2007). Hispanic infants and infants born 
at  estimated  gestational  age  <37  weeks  or  with  low  birth  weight  have  comprised  a
larger proportion of pertussis deaths 
than would have been expected on the basis of population estimates 
(47,53,58). Compared with the prevaccine era, during 
2000--2006, the proportion of reported pertussis deaths among infants aged <3 months
increased from 37% to 83% 
(Figure 1) (38,47; CDC, unpublished data, 2007).
 Since  the  1970s,  parents,  especially  mothers,  have  been  identified  as  the  most
important source of infant pertussis; 
however, a source has been identified in only 30%--60% of cases investigated 
(5--7,34,38,42,48,59--68). One or more 
household contact with pertussis is the source of pertussis in 
approximately  75%  of  cases  among  infants  aged  <6  months  for  whom  the  source  is
identified. A parent is implicated in approximately 25% of cases in infants, including the
mother in 16%--19% 
of cases. A sibling is implicated as the source of transmission in <10% of cases 
(5,7,34).
 Mathematical  modeling  evaluating  different  vaccine  strategies  for  the  United  States
has suggested that pertussis 
vaccination  of  90%  of  household  contacts  (children,  adolescents,  and  adults)  of
newborns, in addition to pertussis vaccination of 75% 
of  adolescents  generally  in  the  population,  might  prevent  approximately  75%  of
pertussis cases among infants aged 0--23 
months (69). Another model estimated vaccination of 
both parents of an infant before discharge from the hospital could prevent 38% 
of  infant  cases  and  deaths  (70).  However,  the  efficacy  of  these  strategies  in  practice
has not been evaluated.
 Disease Burden  Although pertussis is a nationally notifiable disease in the United
States 
(71), data on the pregnancy status of women 
with  pertussis  have  not  been  collected.  However,  the  burden  of  pertussis  among
pregnant women is likely to be similar to 
the  burden  among  other  adults  in  the  population.  Pertussis  reports  typically
demonstrate increases in 
activity  every  3--4  years  (72);  aside  from  these  cycles  of  activity,  the  number  of
reported cases of pertussis in the United States has increased gradually 
since 1976. During 2004--2005, more than 25,000 cases were reported per year 
(Figure  2).  During  2006,  a  total  of  15,632  pertussis  cases  were  reported,  including
2,029 (13%) cases among infants, 5,045 (32%) cases among children aged 
1--14  years,  5,148  (33%)  cases  among  persons  aged  15--39  years,  and  3,331  (21%)
cases among adults aged
>40  years.  A  total  of  40  pertussis-related  deaths  were  reported  in  2005  and  16  in
2006; 39 (98%) of these deaths occurred among infants in 2005 
and 14 (88%) in 2006 (CDC unpublished data, 2007). Prospective and serologic studies
suggest that pertussis infection 
and reinfection are underrecognized among adults and adolescents 
(29,73--75). The pertussis burden is believed to be 
substantially  more  than  the  number  of  reported  cases;  approximately  600,000  cases
are estimated to occur annually just among 
adults (1,34,76).
 Transmission in Obstetric and Neonatal Health-Care Settings
 Health-care personnel can transmit B. 
pertussis in health-care settings if pertussis has not been considered by hospital 
staff (1,77,78). Outbreaks have been documented in prenatal and postnatal clinics 
(79,80), maternity wards 
(51,62,81--83), neonatal nurseries, and neonatal intensive-care services 
(62,81,84--90). Ongoing transmission is facilitated by delay 
in isolation and treatment of patients and in prophylaxis of contacts and by inconsistent
use of face or nose and 
mouth  protection  (1,85,87,91).  Unprotected  exposures  to  pertussis  in  health-care
settings can result in labor-intensive, 
disruptive,  and  costly  investigations  and  control  measures,  particularly  when  the
number of contacts is substantial 
(80,92).  Pertussis  transmitted  to  health-care  personnel  or  patients  can  result  in
substantial morbidity (and on rare occasions in fatal 
disease) among hospitalized infants 
(79,80,85--88,93,94).
 Health-care personnel who have not been vaccinated with Tdap (Table 2) can be an
important source of pertussis 
and pertussis outbreaks in obstetric and neonatal settings. A wide range of health-care
disciplines have been implicated, 
including physicians, resident physicians, and students 
(80,82, 85,95); nurses and nurse midwives 
(51,81,85,87,96--98); and aides, medical assistants, and educators 
(1,51,78,79,81,82, 85,87). Pregnant and postpartum women with unrecognized 
pertussis and visitors to prenatal, obstetric, and neonatal units, including fathers and
other close relatives, pose a substantial risk 
for transmission to infants, pregnant women, and health-care personnel and have been
associated with outbreaks in these 
settings  (6,41,62,80,81,84--86,93,98).  Early  recognition  and  treatment  of  pertussis  in
pregnant and postpartum women 
and  prophylaxis  of  household  contacts  who  visit  health-care  settings  is  critical  to
prevent continuing transmission. 
Antimicrobial 
treatment for women who have pertussis near term or at delivery and prophylaxis for
their newborns and household contacts 
are effective in preventing further transmission 
(42,99).
 Diagnosis   The  diagnosis  of  pertussis  is  complicated  by  the  limitations  of  currently
available diagnostic tests. The only 
pertussis diagnostic tests that are accepted to confirm a case for purposes of national
reporting are culture and polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) (when the clinical case definition also is met) 
(100; Box 1). Multiple factors affect the sensitivity, 
specificity, and interpretation of diagnostic tests for pertussis 
(101,102).
 Culture  Culture to isolate B. pertussis is essential for identifying the organism early in
the course of disease 
(103) and for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, if indicated. Isolation of 
B. pertussis by culture is 100% specific; for optimal yield, 
culture requires specimens that contain nasopharyngeal cells obtained by aspirate or
nasopharyngeal swab and special medium 
for growth. The sensitivity of culture early in pertussis varies (range: 30%--60%) 
(103--105). Outside of infancy, the yield 
of B. pertussis declines to 1%--3% in specimens taken in the third week of cough illness
or later, after starting 
antimicrobial treatment, or in a patient who was vaccinated previously 
(106,107). B. pertussis can be isolated in culture as early as 72 hours 
after plating but requires 1--2 weeks before a result can 
definitively be called negative (108).
 Polymerase  Chain  Reaction   DNA  amplification  (e.g.,  PCR)  to  detect  B.  pertussis  has
increased sensitivity and more rapid turnaround time 
(109--111).  When  symptoms  of  classic  pertussis  are  present  (e.g.,  >2  weeks  of
paroxysmal cough), PCR can be two to three times 
more likely than culture to detect B. pertussis in a known positive sample 
(101,103,112,113). As with culture, the PCR result 
is  affected  by  the  technique  used  to  collect  the  specimen;  a  poorly  taken
nasopharyngeal swab is more likely to be negative 
by  both  culture  and  PCR.  PCR  is  less  affected  than  culture  by  antimicrobial  therapy
because the organism does not need to 
be viable for the test to be positive. Adults and adolescents who have specimens taken
later in the course of illness, who 
have  started  antibiotic  treatment,  or  who  were  vaccinated  previously  tend  to  have
PCR-positive, culture-negative test 
results (103,114).
 Although PCR testing for pertussis has been available for nearly 20 years 
(115), no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)--licensed PCR test kit is available.
The analytical sensitivity, accuracy, and quality control of PCR-based
B. pertussis tests vary widely among laboratories. PCR assays used by the majority of
laboratories amplify a single gene 
sequence,  typically  within  the  insertion  sequence  IS481.  Both  false-positive  and
false-negative results have been reported with these 
assays; reported outbreaks of respiratory illness mistakenly attributed to pertussis have
resulted in unnecessary 
investigation and treatment, and unnecessary chemoprophylaxis of contacts 
(112,116--119). Using more than one genetic 
target and consensus interpretation criteria for PCR diagnosis of pertussis 
(120,121) has been suggested as a way to provide increased assurance 
of specificity (122) and to allow discrimination between Bordetella species.
 Other Diagnostic Tests  Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) tests provide rapid 
results (within hours), but sensitivity (10%--50%) is less than 
with culture (123). With use of monoclonal reagents, the specificity of DFA should be
>90%. However, interpretation of the test 
is subjective, and, when interpreted by an inexperienced microbiologist, the specificity
can be lower 
(110).  Diagnosis  of  pertussis  by  serology  requires  a  substantial  change  in  titer  for
pertussis antigens (typically fourfold) from acute (<2 weeks after 
cough  onset)  to  convalescent  sera  (>4  weeks  after  the  acute  sample).  The  results
typically become available too late in the course 
of the illness to be useful clinically. Single-sample serologic tests for antipertussis toxin
(anti-PT) IgG have been developed 
for  research  purposes;  sera  must  be  collected  at  least  2  weeks  after  the  onset  of
symptoms 
(124).  Pertussis  serology  assays  using  commercial  reagents  are  available,  but  these
assays are not validated clinically and do not differentiate between recent 
and remote infection and vaccination 
(125,126). No serologic assay is licensed by FDA for routine diagnostic use in the 
United States.
 Postexposure Prophylaxis and Treatment  A macrolide (erythromycin, azithromycin, or
clarithromycin) 
is the preferred antimicrobial for postexposure prophylaxis 
and  treatment  of  pertussis  (127).  Antimicrobial  treatment  administered  in  the  early
(catarrhal) phase of the illness can modify 
the severity of the symptoms (36,128,129). An antimicrobial generally does not modify
the severity or the course of the 
illness after paroxysmal cough is established but is used to eliminate 
B. pertussis and halt transmission 
(36,127--129). Without use of an effective antimicrobial, 
B. pertussis can be recovered for 6 weeks or longer from infant patients and for 21 days
or 
longer from adult and adolescent patients. Detailed 
recommendations, indications, and schedules for postexposure 
antimicrobial prophylaxis and treatment of pertussis have been published previously 
(127).
 Pregnant women with pertussis near term and other household contacts with pertussis
are an important source of 
pertussis for newborn infants 
(6,41,42,62,64,99). Antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis are effective in preventing
transmission 
of pertussis to neonates. A macrolide is administered to a woman with pertussis that is
acquired late in pregnancy or 
shortly before delivery, her household contacts, and the neonate. Early recognition of
pertussis in a pregnant woman is necessary 
to ensure the effectiveness of this approach 
(42,99).
 Pregnancy  is  not  a  contraindication  for  use  of  erythromycin,  azithromycin,  or
clarithromycin. Erythromycin 
and azithromycin are listed as FDA Category B drugs, and clarithromycin is listed as a
Category C drug 
(130--132).  Macrolides  can  interact  with  a  variety  of  other  therapeutic  agents,
precluding concurrent use. Although macrolides can 
have gastrointestional side effects (e.g., nausea and vomiting), 
serious side effects (e.g., hepatic dysfunction or 
pseudomembranous  colitis)  are  rare  (127).  Infants  aged  <1  month  who  receive
erythromycin are at increased risk for infantile hypertrophic 
pyloric stenosis (83,133--136). For this reason, and because azithromycin is associated
with fewer adverse effects than 
erythromycin,  azithromycin  is  the  preferred  antimicrobial  for  prophylaxis  of  neonates
exposed to pertussis 
(127). Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has been reported in two preterm infants
who received azithromycin for postexposure prophylaxis 
(137); however, a causal association between infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and
azithromycin has not been established.
 Immunity  to  Pertussis   The  mechanisms  of  protection  against  pertussis  are
incompletely understood. On the basis of studies in animals 
and humans, both humoral and cellular immunity are believed to play a complementary
role 
(138--143). The protection that results from 
B.  pertussis  infection  or  pertussis  vaccines  persists  for  an  estimated  5--10  years  or
more. Protection wanes 
over time, leaving persons susceptible to infection or reinfection 
(4,75,144--150).
 Humoral  Immunity  to  Pertussis  Vaccine  Antigens   Immune  responses  to  B.  pertussis
can be directed variably against a range of pertussis toxins and antigens. No level 
of  antibody,  presence  of  specific  antibodies,  or  antibody  profile  has  been  accepted
universally as a quantifiable serologic 
measure  of  protection  (139,141,151--158).  Studies  of  parenterally  administered
immune globulins for postexposure 
prophylaxis (159,160) or for treatment of pertussis 
(28,161--165) report mixed results and do not clarify the role of passive antibodies 
in  prevention  or  treatment  of  pertussis.  By  extrapolation,  these  results  do  not  help
predict the role of transplacental 
maternal  antibodies  in  infant  protection.   Pertussis  toxin  (PT),  previously  called
lymphocytosis promoting factor (LPF), is considered one of the most important of 
a  range  of  clinically  relevant  toxins  and  virulence  factors  of  B.  pertussis  (including
pertactin or 69-kDa protein [PRN], 
fimbriae types 2 and 3 [FIM], filamentous hemagglutinin [FHA]) 
(140,142,152,157,166--169). Detoxified PT is a component of 
all  pertussis  vaccines.  The  preventive  efficacy  of  a  pediatric  DTaP  vaccine  containing
detoxified PT as the only 
immunizing  antigen  was  71%  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI]  =  63%--78%)  against
classical pertussis 
(170).  However,  the  contribution  to  protection  by  anti-PT  varied  in  analyses  of  the
humoral immune responses to specific vaccine antigens when evaluated in 
two  household  studies.  Elevated  concentrations  of  anti-PRN  and  anti-FIM  were
associated most closely with protection in 
these (152,157) and other studies 
(171). Evidence of added protection from anti-FHA has been mixed 
(152,156,157,172,173).
 Cellular Immunity to Pertussis Vaccine Antigens  Cell-mediated immune mechanisms
clear 
B. pertussis from within macrophages and other cells 
(52,139,174--177). In addition to humoral immune responses, B. pertussis antigens in
acellular pertussis vaccines induce cell-mediated 
immune responses (178) after primary immunization with pediatric DTaP among infants
(158,179), after booster vaccination among 
children  (140,141,149),  and  after  booster  vaccination  with  reduced  pertussis  antigen
content vaccines among 
adolescents (178,180--183) and adults 
(183,184). Protection is maintained among children whose antibody levels drop 
below the level of detection over time (185) suggesting that cell-mediated immunity is
an important component of protection. 
Cell-mediated  immune  responses  remain  measurable  substantially  longer  than
antibodies to the same antigens, particularly PT, and the 
cell-mediated immune responses to initial doses of pertussis vaccines are believed to
correlate better with long-term immunity 
than antibody responses 
(140,141,149,158,178,180,181,183,185).
 Prevalence of Pertussis-Specific Antibodies: Pregnant Women and their Infants
 Although the importance of antipertussis activity in sera relative to protection remains
uncertain, studies conducted 
since the 1930s have determined the prevalence of antipertussis activity in sera from
mothers and infants using 
multiple assays (Tables 4--8) 
(37,154,186--199).  Detectable  pertussis-specific  antibodies  have  been  identified  in
unvaccinated 
women without a history of pertussis 
(28,187,190,192), women with a past history of pertussis 
(28,187,190,192),  women  who  likely  received  whole-cell  pertussis  vaccine  during
childhood 
(195,196,198--200), and women with a recent history of 
pertussis  (99).  With  the  exception  of  women  with  recent  pertussis,  the  majority  of
pregnant women have low geometric 
mean  concentrations  (GMCs)  of  anti-PT  and  antibodies  to  other  pertussis  antigens
(Tables 4--8) 
(159),  consistent  with  generally  low  concentrations  of  antipertussis  antibodies  among
adults surveyed in the general population 
(147,201--205). GMCs of pertussis-specific antibodies among pregnant women typically
have been low regardless of age, as demonstrated in 
a predominantly (80%) African-American population reported in 2005 
(199). A 2006 study of pregnant Hispanics found 
lower GMCs among adolescents than among women aged >20 years (198).
 The  efficiency  of  maternal-fetal  transfer  of  IgG  antibodies  to  pertussis-specific
antigens varies; the majority of 
investigators  report  similar  antigen-specific  concentrations  in  cord  or  neonatal  infant
sera and in maternal sera measured late in 
pregnancy or at delivery (195--200), but higher concentrations in cord or neonatal sera
than in maternal sera have been reported, 
which might indicate active transport in certain settings (Tables 7 and 
8) 
(195,197,199). In a 2005 survey of mothers and 
their infants, anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN were detected in maternal sera from 35%,
95%, and 80% of women, 
respectively, and in cord sera from 45%, 93%, and 81% of infants, respectively 
(199). Among 17 infants studied in 1990, the half-life 
of transplacental maternal antibody was 36.3 days for anti-PT, 40.3 days for anti-FHA,
and 55.0 days for pertussis 
agglutinins  (195).  Transplacental  maternal  antibody  was  not  detectable  or  was
negligible in the majority of infants by age 6--8 
weeks (195,197) or by age 4 months 
(195), consistent with the results of early studies 
(186). By contrast, in a study of 23 unvaccinated Swedish infants whose mothers had
pertussis late in pregnancy, five infants had neutralizing antibody 
detectable as long as 14 months and detectable anti-PT for 5 months or longer 
(99).
 Kinetics of Pertussis Booster Vaccination in Nonpregnant 
Adults and Adolescents  The majority of adults and adolescents have had exposure to 
B. pertussis, pertussis antigen--containing vaccines, or both, 
and they will have a booster response to vaccination with pertussis antigens 
(184,206). A rise in antibodies is measurable by 7 
days after vaccination (207), and GMCs reach near-peak levels by 2 weeks after booster
vaccination 
(207--210).  Antibody  concentrations  decline  rapidly  in  the  first  few  months  following
vaccination, after which the rate of decline 
slows (157,181,209,211). Anti-PT levels decline more rapidly than anti-PRN or anti-FHA
levels. Among adults who received 
a booster dose of an acellular pertussis vaccine without tetanus or diphtheria toxoids,
concentrations of IgG anti-PT and 
anti-PRN  declined  58%  and  39%,  respectively,  after  6  months.  By  18  months  after
vaccination, concentrations declined 73% 
and 56%, respectively (209).
 Vaccinating  Pregnant  Women  against  Pertussis   Tdap   No  prelicensure  studies  were
conducted  with  Tdap  in  pregnant  women.  In  2005,  to  increase  understanding  of  the
safety 
of Tdap in relationship to pregnancy, both Tdap manufacturers established registries to
solicit voluntary reports of 
pregnant women who received Tdap during pregnancy or who received Tdap and were
determined subsequently to be 
pregnant  (212,213).  The  main  utility  of  the  registries  is  to  signal  the  possibility  and
nature of any risk 
(214). All women who are vaccinated with Tdap at any time during pregnancy should be
reported to the registry as early as possible during 
the pregnancy. Information from pregnancy registries differs from surveillance reports,
which are used to evaluate 
outcomes 
among women when an adverse outcome of pregnancy already might have occurred
(e.g., an infant born with a birth 
defect) (214).
 As  of  December  31,  2007,  GlaxoSmithKline  had  received  five  reports  of  pregnancy
exposure to 
BOOSTRIX®  within  28  days  before  conception  or  during  any  trimester  of  pregnancy,
including two in the first trimester, one in the second 
trimester,  and  two  during  an  unknown  trimester.  Among  the  two  first-trimester
exposures, one subject delivered a normal infant at 
33 weeks' gestation, and one subject was lost to 
follow-up. Of the remaining exposures, information on the outcome of 
two  pregnancies  was  not  yet  available,  and  one  subject  was  lost  to  follow-up
(GlaxoSmithKline, unreported data, 2008).
 As of November 23, 2007, sanofi pasteur had received 107 spontaneous reports and
47 reports from 
postlicensing surveillance studies of exposure to 
ADACEL® during pregnancy. For these 154 reports, pregnancy outcomes were 68 
live  infants  (including  64  term  deliveries  [one  with  a  congenital  anomaly]  and  four
preterm deliveries [one at 28 weeks 
after  complications  of  pregnancy,  labor,  and  delivery;  two  at  35  weeks  for
preeclampsia; and one at 35 weeks for 
breech  presentation]);  three  spontaneous  abortions  (at  9,  51,  and  99  days
postvaccination); three induced abortions; and one 
fetal  demise  (at  35  days  postvaccination).  For  32  reports,  either  the  outcome  of
pregnancy was unknown or the patient was lost 
to  follow-up,  and  for  47  reports,  information  on  outcome  of  pregnancy  was  not  yet
available (sanofi pasteur, 
unreported  data,  2008).   A  retrospective  survey  of  4,524  health-care  personnel
vaccinated in a mass vaccination campaign conducted in 
2006 provides additional information regarding adverse reactions in pregnant women
within 14 days of receiving 
Tdap  (ADACEL®)  (215,216).  Pregnancy  was  not  an  exclusion  criterion  for  Tdap;  24
health-care personnel who received 
Tdap identified themselves as pregnant at the time of vaccination. Among 2,676 (59%)
survey respondents, 1,792 
(67%) received Tdap at an interval of >2 years after their most recent dose of Td; 17 of
these respondents identified themselves 
as  pregnant.  Adverse  reactions  reported  by  the  17  pregnant  women  were  compared
with reactions reported by 472 
nonpregnant  female  personnel  aged  18--44  years.  The  frequencies  of  injection-site
pain, redness, and swelling of moderate to 
severe  intensity  were  not  greater  among  the  pregnant  women  than  among  the
nonpregnant women. Three of the 
pregnant  women  reported  feeling  "feverish"  after  receiving  Tdap.  None  of  the  17
pregnant women reported seeking nonroutine medical 
attention for the adverse reaction (215,216). Among the pregnant women vaccinated
with Tdap, results of the outcome of pregnancy 
were known for 10 women; no pregnancy resulted in premature birth or abnormality in
the infant when assessed shortly after 
birth  (Elizabeth  A.  Talbot,  Dartmouth  College,  Lebanon,  New  Hampshire,  personal
communication, 2007).
 Whole-Cell  Pertussis  Vaccine   Five  clinical  trials  conducted  during  the  1930s  and
1940s evaluated vaccinating pregnant women with whole-cell 
pertussis  vaccine  as  a  strategy  to  increase  the  levels  of  maternal  pertussis-specific
antibodies transferred to their infants via the 
placenta  (Table  9)  (186,189,190,192,193,217).  The  protective  efficacy  of  the  vaccine
against pertussis in the women was not 
a  consideration.  Whole-cell  pertussis  vaccine  was  prepared  from  sterile  extracts  of
killed
B.  pertussis.  To  maximize  the  passive  transfer  of  maternal  antibody,  pregnant
women were vaccinated with 2--6 doses at 1- to 2-week intervals during the 
third trimester.
 Local reactions to vaccination in the pregnant women were common, some of which
were severe. Systemic reactions 
were uncommon, adverse pregnancy outcomes were not reported (Table 9) 
(190,192,193,217).
 The majority of women had substantial rise in titer to 
B. pertussis antigens in postvaccination sera compared with 
prevaccine titers (Tables 4--6) 
(186,189,190,192,193,217). Neither history of pertussis 
(190,192) nor preexisting titers of antibodies 
in the women correlated with maternal titers after vaccination 
(193). The majority of infant antibody titers were lower 
than (186) or similar to maternal titers 
(37,150,186,187,189--193). Infant titers exceeded maternal titers in certain cases 
although higher titers might have been within the range of assay variation 
(37,186--191,193).
 In subsets of infants in two studies, the duration of detectable transplacental pertussis
antibodies was followed 
among  unvaccinated  infants  (186,217).  The  mothers  in  both  studies  had  received  3
doses of whole-cell pertussis vaccine during 
the  third  trimester.  The  mean  of  the  agglutinin  titers  among  13  infants  in  one  study
dropped 
from 1:160§ at birth to 1:80 at age 
2 months; titers no longer were measurable at "a few months of age" 
(186). Of 36 infants with high agglutinin titers 
at birth in the other study, 16 (44%) had titers of 
>1:300 at age 3 months. None of 9 infants followed to age 6 months had a titer 
of 1:300 (217).
 Infant  Protection  by  Transplacental  Maternal  Antibody   The  role  of  transplacental
maternal antibody in infant protection against pertussis remains uncertain. Prevaccine 
era observations concluded that infants have no "congenital 
immunity" and are susceptible to pertussis from the "day of 
birth,"  with  the  possible  exception  of  an  infant  whose  mother  had  pertussis  during
pregnancy 
(35,189,190,192,193,219
).  Transplacental  maternal  antibodies  might  explain  the  smaller  proportion  of  infant
pertussis deaths observed in the first 
month of life compared with the second and third months of life (Figure 1) 
(35,45). An alternative explanation might be that 
parents avoid exposing newborn infants to ill contacts 
(99,219).
 Two  retrospective  surveys  were  conducted  after  early  vaccine  trials  in  pregnant
women to assess infant protection 
(217,220).  In  one  survey  conducted  during  the  1940s,  a  subset  of  100  (59%)  of  170
women who received 6 doses of whole-cell 
pertussis vaccine during the third trimester and 100 women who were not vaccinated
were questioned regarding pertussis in 
their  infants  during  the  first  year  of  life.  During  the  first  6  months  of  life,  eight
exposures (three of which were "close 
exposures") and no cases of pertussis were reported among 
infants whose mothers had been vaccinated, and six exposures and three 
cases  of  infant  pertussis  were  reported  among  infants  whose  mothers  had  not  been
vaccinated. From age 
6--11 months, two cases of infant pertussis were reported in each group 
(220). In a second survey by the same investigators, a subset of 66 (62%) of 
106  women  who  received  3  doses  of  whole-cell  pertussis  vaccine  during  the  third
trimester 
reported two exposures and no case of pertussis among their infants during the first 6
months of life 
(217). The results of these surveys suggested that 
high  concentration  of  transplacental  pertussis  antibodies  might  provide  a  degree  of
infant protection against pertussis in the first 
6 months of life (217,220).
 Inhibitory Effect of Transplacental Maternal Antibody on Infant Immunization
 Transplacental  maternal  antibodies  to  pertussis  antigens  can  interfere  with  the
infant's response to active immunization 
with the pertussis components of pediatric DTP and pediatric DTaP 
(221). A proposed mechanism for the interference 
with  pertussis  and  other  vaccine  antigens  is  maternal  antibody  binding  to  vaccine
antigens, masking the vaccine antigens from 
the  infant's  B  cells.  Infant  antigen-presenting  cells  also  might  take  up  maternal
antibody-vaccine antigen complexes 
stimulating  selective  T-cell  responses  without  humoral  immune  responses  to  the
vaccine antigens 
(221--223).  The  concentrations  and  specificities  of  the  maternal  antibodies  for
vaccine-antigen epitopes contributes to the degree of interference 
(221,223--225).  The  inhibitory  effect  of  transplacental  maternal  antibody  can  be
detectable for a few weeks or for more 
than 1 year (221,222,224--228). As transplacental 
maternal antibody declines over time, a threshold is reached when the 
infant's immune system responds to vaccine antigens in subsequent doses. In theory,
the threshold concentration of 
residual maternal antibody could be lower than the concentration of antibody needed
for infant protection, but this concentration 
is not known for pertussis. In this setting, a theoretical window of "relative 
susceptibility" exists for the infant until the 
infant mounts a humoral immune response to a subsequent dose of vaccine 
(222,229).
 Interference  with  Pertussis  Responses  to  Pediatric  DTP   Substantially  lower
concentrations of infant IgG anti-PT result after 3 doses of pediatric DTP among infants
with 
"high"  (variably  defined)  prevaccination  levels  of  maternal  IgG  anti-PT,  than  among
infants with "low" or no 
measurable prevaccination level of maternal IgG anti-PT 
(195, 230--233). The post-dose 3 concentrations of infant anti-PT in one 
study were 28% or 56% lower with each doubling of the concentration of transplacental
maternal anti-PT, respectively, for the 
two DTP products studied (p <0.05) 
(233). The reductions in post--dose 3 concentrations also were significant for 
anti-FIM (18% lower) and agglutinins (15% lower) for one DTP product, and for anti-FHA
(16% lower) for the other DTP 
product, with each doubling of the concentration of the specific transplacental maternal
antibodies (p
<0.05) (233).
 Interference with Pertussis Responses to Pediatric DTaP  Transplacental maternal IgG
anti-PT might interfere less with infant responses after 3 doses of pediatric DTaP than 
after pediatric DTP (195,196,230,233). The percentage 
decrease in post--dose 3 infant antibody response with each doubling 
of  the  concentration  of  maternal  antibodies  was  3%  for  anti-PT  (not  statistically
significant), but was 13% for anti-PRN, 
17% for anti-FIM, 10% for agglutinins, and 8% for anti-FHA (all statistically significant; p
<0.05) when results from several DTaP products were combined in one study 
(233). The difference between interference by maternal antibody with infant 
responses to DTP and DTaP might result from the higher content of pertussis-specific
antigens in pediatric DTaP than in 
pediatric 
DTP relative to the concentration of transplacental maternal antibody 
(159,222). In addition, the maternal 
antibodies  induced  by  the  mothers'  childhood  DTP  vaccinations  might  have  less
specificity for the pertussis vaccine antigens in 
acellular pertussis vaccines (222,234--236).
 Noninterference with Pertussis Cellular Immune Responses to Pediatric DTP or DTaP
 Infants  who  have  relatively  poor  humoral  immune  responses  to  active  immunization
with whole-cell or acellular 
pertussis  vaccine  in  the  presence  of  inhibitory  concentrations  of  transplacental
maternal antibody have evidence of T-cell priming 
for  booster  (anamestic)  responses  (158,237).  Protection  against  pertussis  in  T-cell
primed infants in the absence of 
specific humoral antibodies has not been established 
(158,238--241).
 Lactation   Existing  data  do  not  provide  evidence  that  human  colostral  pertussis
antibodies contribute to infant protection, 
although pertussis-specific antibodies present in the mother are found in colostral milk 
(186,190,242).  Protection  studies  in  animal  models  suggest  human  and  animal
colostral-derived pertussis antibodies can protect animals when the antibodies 
are absorbed or injected parenterally 
(243--245); however, the relevance of these studies for human infants is 
uncertain  (190,246,247).  Human  breast  milk  antibodies  do  not  enter  the  human
neonatal circulation from the intestine in 
substantial amounts. In contrast, infant pigs, horses, ruminants, dogs, and cats acquire
the majority of neonatal protection 
through intestinal uptake of colostral antibodies 
(245,248--250). Maternal antibodies in human milk do not interfere with the 
infant immune response to pediatric vaccines 
(23).
 Tetanus  is  caused  by  Clostridium  tetani  spores,  which  are  ubiquitous  in  the
environment. Spores enter the body 
through disrupted skin or mucus membranes. When inoculated into oxygen-poor sites
(e.g., necrotic tissue or wounds), 
C.  tetani  spores  germinate  to  vegetative  bacilli  that  elaborate  tetanospasmin,  a
potent neurotoxin. More than 80% of cases of tetanus 
are of the generalized syndrome; the remaining cases are localized or cephalic. Persons
with generalized cases typically have 
trismus (lockjaw), followed by rigidity and painful contractions of the skeletal muscles
that can impair respiratory function. 
Glottic  spasm,  respiratory  failure,  and  autonomic  instability  can  result  in  death.  The
onset of tetanus typically is within 7 days of 
the  injury  (range:  0--112  days)  The  course  of  tetanus  is  up  to  4  weeks  or  longer,
followed by a prolonged period of 
convalescence (251,252).
 Obstetric  and  Neonatal  Tetanus   Obstetric  tetanus  is  defined  as  tetanus  during
pregnancy or with onset within 6 weeks after the termination of 
pregnancy (253). Obstetric tetanus occurs after contamination of wounds or abrasions
during pregnancy or after unclean deliveries 
or  abortions.  In  a  review  covering  1941--1990,  an  estimated  65%--80%  of  cases  of
obstetric tetanus occurred in the puerperal 
or  postpartum  period;  the  majority  of  the  other  cases  occurred  after  surgical  or
spontaneous abortions 
(254).
 Obstetric  tetanus  has  the  highest  mortality  when  the  incubation  period  is  short  and
respiratory complications are 
present (255). Cases can be complicated by gram-negative sepsis 
(256). Case-fatality rates vary (range: 16%-->50%); higher 
fatality rates are reported from places where access to medical intensive care is limited
(255,257,258). Case-fatality rates 
historically have been higher for postabortal than for postpartum obstetric tetanus 
(254).
 Neonatal  tetanus  (tetanus  neonatorum)  is  associated  with  contamination  of  the
umbilical stump. In nearly all cases of 
infant  tetanus,  onset  occurs  in  the  first  month  of  life.  Symptoms  commonly  begin  at
3--14 days of life and are characterized 
by increasing irritability and difficulty feeding. Signs of neonatal tetanus are similar to
tetanus in older age groups. 
Case-fatality rates vary (range: 10%--100%) 
(252,259). Infants who survive can have residual neurologic injury (e.g., cerebral palsy 
and psychomotor retardation) (252).
 Burden  Tetanus is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States 
(260). In 2006, a total of 41 cases were reported. No 
cases occurred among women aged 15--19 years or those aged 
30--39 years. One case occurred among women aged 20--29 
years, and three cases occurred among women aged 40--49 years. None of the women
died. During 1972--2006, 
case reporting forms did not collect information regarding pregnancy; however, no case
of obstetric tetanus was identified 
among  more  than  1,000  reports  to  NNDSS  (CDC,  unpublished  data,  2006).  In  1999,
tetanus-specific coding became available 
in CDC's mortality database; no case of tetanus-associated 
obstetric death was reported through 2005, the most recent year 
for  which  data  are  available  (CDC,  unpublished  data,  2008).   During  the  1950s,
approximately  100  neonatal  tetanus  deaths  were  reported  annually  in  the  United
States, and 
neonates comprised more than one third of tetanus deaths in all age groups 
(261,262). During 1972--2006, the cumulative number 
of  reported  neonatal  tetanus  cases  decreased  to  32;  the  most  recent  cases  were
reported in 1989, 1995, 1998, and 2001 
(263).  Among  these  32  neonatal  cases,  27  (84%)  births  occurred  in  a  nonhospital
setting; 30 of 31 mothers with available 
history reported never having received a dose of tetanus toxoid vaccine 
(264--266; CDC, unpublished data, 2006).
 Diagnosis  and  Treatment   The  diagnosis  of  tetanus  is  clinical  and  is  supported  by  a
compatible setting, immunization history, and exclusion of 
other possible diseases. Anaerobic cultures of tissues or aspirates for 
C. tetani typically are not positive. Low or undetectable levels 
of serum antitoxin at the time of onset are compatible with the diagnosis of tetanus,
but higher levels of antitoxin do not 
exclude the diagnosis (252,267). Electromyography might aid in the diagnosis of certain
cases 
(268).  Postpartum  eclampsia,  which  typically  occurs  within  the  first  few  days  after
delivery, was the most important disease in the differential diagnosis 
in community-based studies (254).
 Treatment of tetanus is directed at neutralizing unbound toxin with administration of
human tetanus immune 
globulin,  removing  the  source  of  infection  through  debridement,  and  use  of  an
antimicrobial (e.g., metronidazole). The control 
of  rigidity  and  spasms,  attendant  respiratory  and  autonomic  dysfunction  and  their
complications, and maintaining 
nutrition require careful and sustained attention that is best provided in intensive-care
settings with specialty 
consultation (251,252,269).
 Immunity to Tetanus  The level of antitoxin that protects against obstetric and neonatal
tetanus can vary with the wound characteristics, the 
degree  of  contamination,  the  specificity  of  the  antitoxin,  and  the  type  of  assay
employed to measure the antitoxin level 
(270).  The  minimum  level  of  antitoxin  correlating  with  protection  is  0.01  IU/mL  as
measured by in vivo neutralization assay. 
An antitoxin concentration at >0.1 IU/mL is the preferred correlate of protection based
on the results of other assays 
(e.g., enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay [ELISA]), and 
because higher concentrations of antitoxin might be necessary 
to protect in certain circumstances 
(252,270). The serum level of tetanus antitoxin achieved in response to vaccination 
is  determined  by  the  number  of  doses  of  tetanus  toxoid,  the  type  of  tetanus  toxoid
administered (adjuvanted toxoid, which 
is  more  immunogenic,  has  replaced  fluid  toxoid),  the  interval  since  the  most  recent
dose, and individual variation in 
the response to vaccination (270).
 Deferring Td During Pregnancy to Substitute Tdap in the Immediate 
Postpartum  Period   Ensuring  maternal  and  neonatal  tetanus  protection  as  part  of
prenatal care is a priority for women who are due for 
a  recommended  decennial  tetanus  and  diphtheria  toxoids  booster  dose.  For  women
who have not received a dose of 
Tdap previously, administering Td during pregnancy, followed in a few months by Tdap
postpartum, theoretically 
could increase the risk or severity of adverse reaction, which typically is local. Moderate
to severe local reactions have 
been  associated  with  high  levels  of  tetanus  and  diphtheria  antitoxin  (see  Interval
Between Td and Tdap). In these women, 
deferring  the  Td  booster  during  pregnancy  to  substitute  Tdap  in  the  immediate
postpartum period may be considered to 
boost  protection  against  pertussis  as  well  as  tetanus  and  diphtheria.  The  majority  of
women of childbearing age who have lived 
in 
the United States since infancy or childhood have received 
4--5 infant and childhood doses of tetanus toxoid with 
pediatric DTP or DTaP and >1 booster dose of Td (or tetanus toxoid without diphtheria
toxoid [TT]) in accordance with 
national  recommendations  (1,2,271).  The  recommended  schedule  of  vaccination  to
prevent tetanus is intended to maintain levels 
of antitoxin considerably higher than the minimum level required for protection against
the majority of cases of 
tetanus,  including  protection  among  persons  with  intrinsically  lower  responses  to
vaccination 
(1,2,252,271--273).
 In 2004, women aged 15--39 years accounted for 97% of all births in the United States 
(3).  Data  from  a  population-based  serosurvey  conducted  nationwide  in  the  United
States during 1988--1994 documented tetanus antitoxin concentrations 
at >0.15 IU/mL among >80% of women aged 12--39 years 
(274,275). The proportion of women with antitoxin at 
>0.15 IU/mL declined with increasing age to 62% among women aged 40--49 years 
(274,275). Slightly lower prevalence of this 
titer  was  found  among  women  aged  20--59  years  who  were  not  born  in  the  United
States 
(276). A 1999--2000 study evaluated 2,134 adult patients in an emergency department
for wound management and measurement of their antitoxin titer 
(277). Antitoxin concentrations of 
>0.15  IU/mL  were  present  among  1,051  (95%)  of  1,106  adults  aged  18--39  years.
Among 
adults  of  all  ages  studied,  approximately  95%  of  those  with  up-to-date  vaccination
histories and approximately 86% of those 
whose vaccinations were not up-to-date had antitoxin titers >0.15 IU/mL. The rates of a
protective titer were lower for 
immigrants, persons with less education, and persons aged >70 years 
(277). Limitations of these studies are that one study did not 
report any connection between vaccination histories and antitoxin concentrations 
(274--276), and the other study included 
subjects who might not be representative of the U.S. population 
(277). However, when combined with the small number of 
tetanus  cases  among  women  of  childbearing  age  in  the  United  States,  these  studies
suggest that when pregnant women have 
previously  received  the  recommended  schedule  of  tetanus  and  diphtheria  toxoids
vaccinations, a routine decennial Td booster 
during pregnancy typically can be deferred so Tdap can be substituted at delivery or
before discharge from the hospital or 
birthing center.  Vaccinating to Prevent Obstetric and Neonatal 
Tetanus  Success in preventing obstetric and neonatal tetanus relies on antitoxin being
present at delivery 
(254).  In  countries  where  access  to  childhood  vaccines  is  limited,  neonatal  tetanus
constitutes a major cause of infant mortality; during 1978--1985, 
an estimated 800,000 neonatal tetanus deaths occurred 
annually worldwide (278). In 1974, worldwide elimination of 
neonatal tetanus (less than one case per 1,000 live births) through vaccine initiatives
became a major focus of the 
Expanded Program of Immunization of the World Health 
Organization (WHO) (259,279). The initiative promoted clean deliveries and 
tetanus  toxoid  vaccination  for  pregnant  women.  Nonpregnant  women  of  childbearing
age also were targeted for at least 3 doses 
of  tetanus  toxoid  vaccine  in  supplemental  immunization  activities.   The  strategy  of
targeting  pregnant  women  for  vaccination  to  prevent  neonatal  tetanus  was  based  on
reports published in 
the 1960s concerning two vaccine trials that demonstrated that 
>2 doses of tetanus toxoid administered during pregnancy 
were >95% effective in preventing neonatal tetanus 
(Table 10) (280,281). Subsequent studies confirmed that 3 doses of 
aluminum phosphate-adjuvanted tetanus toxoid (rather than fluid toxoid) administered
during pregnancy induced antitoxin levels 
that would protect the mother and prevent neonatal tetanus for >10 years. Adjuvanted
vaccine also lowered the rates of 
local reactions in pregnant women (282--284).
 Although  the  burden  of  obstetric  tetanus  has  not  been  characterized  as  well  as  the
burden of neonatal tetanus, the 
annual  worldwide  burden  of  obstetric  tetanus  deaths  has  been  estimated  at
15,000--30,000, accounting for approximately 5% of 
all maternal deaths in the 1990s 
(254,259). In April 2006, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) reported on
the success of the maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination initiatives and the plan to
transition from vaccination goals 
for  women  of  childbearing  age  to  universal  tetanus  control,  to  be  achieved  through
sustained high coverage with 
pediatric DTP starting in infancy and childhood and booster doses to prevent tetanus
throughout life 
(259,285,286).
 Safety of Tetanus Vaccination During Pregnancy  No evidence suggests that adverse
outcomes for a mother or fetus increase after tetanus toxoid is administered to a 
pregnant  woman  (1,2,23).  Tetanus  toxoid  administered  during  any  trimester  of
pregnancy was evaluated for association with 
congenital abnormalities at birth during 1980--1994 in Budapest, Hungary. The rate of
tetanus toxoid vaccination among 
21,563 mothers of infants with congenital abnormalities was not significantly different
than the rate of tetanus toxoid 
vaccination  among  35,727  mothers  of  infants  who  were  normal  (0.12%  and  0.09%,
respectively; p = 0.39) 
(287). In a similar study 
conducted in nine countries in South America starting in 1977, approximately one half
of the women had received 
tetanus toxoid during the first trimester of pregnancy. The rate of early tetanus toxoid
vaccination among the mothers of 
34,293  newborns  with  congenital  malformations  (9.2  [CI  =  8.2--10.3]  per  1,000
mothers) was not substantially different than the 
rate among the mothers of 34,477 newborns who were normal (7.6 [CI = 6.6--8.5] per
1,000 mothers) 
(288).
 Infant  Protection  by  Transplacental  Maternal  Antibody   Tetanus  toxoid  is  one  of  the
most  immunogenic  protein  antigens  in  any  vaccine.  Administration  of  2  doses  of
tetanus 
toxoid to pregnant women at least 4--6 weeks before delivery stimulates antitoxin that
protects the mother and readily crosses 
the placenta, thereby protecting the newborn against tetanus when the risk is highest 
(289).  Pregnant  women  who  receive  a  booster  dose  of  tetanus  toxoid  have  a
measurable immune response within 5 days and a peak response in <2 weeks. 
The response to vaccination might be slower after a first (primary) dose or when the
interval after the most recent booster dose 
is long (252,272). Placental transport of maternal IgG antitoxin is efficient; cord blood
levels generally are similar to 
maternal  levels  (290,291).  After  the  neonatal  period,  the  infant  is  at  little  risk  for
tetanus until becoming self-mobile, typically at an 
age when sustained protection has been induced by 3 
infant doses of pediatric DTP or DTaP (252).
 Inhibitory Effect of Transplacental Maternal Antibody on Infant Immunization
 Transplacental  maternal  tetanus  antitoxin  can  interfere  with  the  infant  response  to
active immunization after up to 3 
doses of tetanus toxoid (e.g., in pediatric DTP, DTaP, or DT) 
(222,230,292--297). Certain studies 
(296,297),  but  not  all  (298),  indicate  that  antitoxin  inhibits  the  response  to  tetanus
toxoid after vaccination with
Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid. An 
age-accelerated schedule results in further decrease in infant 
responses in the presence of maternal antitoxin 
(295).  When  levels  of  transplacental  maternal  antitoxin  wane  sufficiently,  infants
respond 
to subsequent doses of vaccine 
(229,293,294,299--301).  T-cell  priming  for  a  booster  response  is  not  substantially
affected 
by maternal antitoxin (222,302, 303). Typically, infants respond to the second dose of
tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine with 
a  protective  level  of  antitoxin,  even  when  the  initial  levels  of  maternal  antitoxin  are
high; 
3 doses of tetanus toxoid are required to achieve antitoxin concentrations that persist
above protective levels 
(292,304).
 Lactation  No substantial difference in the infant immune response to tetanus toxoid (in
DTP) has been identified with consumption 
of human milk compared with consumption of cow milk 
(305).
 Respiratory diphtheria is an acute, severe infection caused by strains of 
Corynebacterium diphtheriae that produce 
diphtheria toxin. Rarely, toxin-producing strains of 
C. ulcerans cause a diphtheria-like illness 
(306). Respiratory diphtheria is characterized by a grayish-colored adherent membrane
on the pharynx, palate, or nasal mucosa that can obstruct the 
airway with fatal outcome. The disease can be complicated by toxin-mediated cardiac,
neurologic, or renal dysfunction. 
Case-fatality rates are >10% 
(307,308).
 Obstetric and Neonatal Diphtheria  Respiratory diphtheria (309--312) or vulvovaginal
infection 
(313,314) can occur during any trimester of pregnancy, at 
term, or in the postpartum period. The mortality rate of 
obstetric respiratory diphtheria is high (estimated at 50%) without 
infusion  of  diphtheria  antitoxin,  even  with  tracheostomy  or  intubation,  and  is
accompanied by fetal loss or premature birth 
in approximately one third of survivors. Early treatment with serum diphtheria antitoxin
improves survival and 
pregnancy  outcomes,  although  complications  of  the  disease  might  require  prolonged
supportive care 
(309--312). Postpartum women with respiratory diphtheria can transmit 
C. diphtheriae to their neonates 
(310).
 Burden  Respiratory diphtheria is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States.
Rare cases occur in the United States 
after  infection  with  diphtheria  toxin--producing  strains  of  C.  diphtheriae  or  other
corynebacteria 
(315,316). During 1998--2006, seven cases of respiratory diphtheria were reported to
CDC. The most recent culture-confirmed adult case of 
respiratory diphtheria caused by C. 
diphtheriae was reported in 2000, and an adult case of respiratory diphtheria caused by
C. ulcerans was reported in 2005 
(306). The risk for diphtheria can be increased during travel to areas in which diphtheria
is endemic; a list 
of  these  areas  is  available  at  http://www.cdc.gov/travel/default.aspx.  Diphtheria  also
can be acquired from persons with 
imported  cases  or  from  carriers  (i.e.,  asymptomatic  persons  who  are  colonized  with
toxin-producing
C. diphtheriae) (315,316).
 Diagnosis and Treatment  The diagnosis of diphtheria is confirmed by isolation of 
C. diphtheriae in culture of the adherent membrane and by 
testing the isolate for toxin production 
(317). The mainstay of treatment in respiratory diphtheria is early administration 
of  diphtheria  antitoxin  (equine),  which  is  available  to  physicians  in  the  United  States
from CDC through an 
FDA-Investigational  New  Drug  protocol  (24-hour  telephone,  770-488-7100).  Additional
information is available 
at
 http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/diphtheria/dat/dat-main.htm.
 No
human-derived serum diphtheria antitoxin is 
available. Antibiotics are administered to limit transmission and to prevent continuing
production of diphtheria toxin 
(318).  Prompt  reporting  of  suspect  cases,  investigation,  culture,  and  antimicrobial
prophylaxis of contacts and immunization of the 
affected community (317,318) is of critical importance. 
Because respiratory diphtheria does not always confer protection against 
future illness, patients should complete active immunization 
with diphtheria toxoid after recovery (286).
 Diphtheria Immunity  Protection against respiratory diphtheria is predominantly from
IgG antibody to diphtheria toxin (antitoxin) induced 
after infection with toxin-producing C. 
diphtheriae or after vaccination with diphtheria toxoid. In areas with little or no 
endemic exposure to toxin-producing C. 
diphtheriae, periodic vaccination is required to maintain immunity 
(237,286,307, 319--321). Although the immune responses to infection and vaccination
vary, antitoxin concentrations of 
>0.1  IU/mL  typically  are  considered  protective.  Concentrations  of  0.01  IU/mL--0.1
IU/mL might provide protection against severe 
disease; concentrations <0.01 IU/mL do not protect against diphtheria 
(286,307,322).
 Td  Booster  During  Pregnancy  for  Diphtheria  Protection   Data  from  a  national
population-based  serosurvey  conducted  during  1988--1994  that  evaluated  the
prevalence of 
immunity to diphtheria (defined as a diphtheria antitoxin concentration of >0.1 IU/mL)
among women in the United States 
determined immunity to diphtheria to be lower than immunity to tetanus (see Tetanus:
Deferring Td During Pregnancy to 
Substitute Tdap in the Immediate Postpartum Period). The prevalence of immunity to
diphtheria decreased with increasing age 
(77% among women aged 12--19 years, 74% among women aged 20--29 years, 65%
among women aged 30--39 years, and
<45%  among  women  aged  >40  years)  and  with  birth  outside  the  United  States  or
less formal education 
(274,276).
 Vaccinating Pregnant Women, Infant Protection by Transplacental Antibody
 Diphtheria  toxoid  vaccine  trials  conducted  among  pregnant  women  in  the  1940s
demonstrated quantitative increases 
in diphtheria antitoxin after the women were vaccinated. 
Maternal antitoxin was transferred efficiently to the 
fetus (217,226,320,323,324). Several studies indicate transplacental maternal antitoxin
provides newborn infants with 
protection against diphtheria at birth if their mother 
is immune (226,250,321,325).
 Safety  The safety of diphtheria toxoid (without tetanus toxoid) vaccination in pregnant
women was examined during the 
1970s  (326).  After  diphtheria  toxoid  was  administered  during  the  first  4  months  of
pregnancy, 75 mother-child pairs were 
followed for malformations until the child reached age 7 years. Although the number of
vaccinated pregnant women studied was 
small,  the  risk  for  malformations  in  their  children  was  lower  than  the  risk  among
children in a much larger group of 
mother-child 
pairs in which the women were not vaccinated with diphtheria toxoid during pregnancy
(survival- and 
race-standardized relative risk: 0.88) (327).
 Inhibitory Effect of Transplacental Maternal Antibody on Infant Immunization
 Transplacental  maternal  diphtheria  antitoxin  concentrations  of  <0.1  IU/mL  can
interfere with primary diphtheria 
toxoid immunization in infancy 
(237,292,321,328--331). The duration of interference is affected by the concentration of
maternal antitoxin, the formulation and toxoid content of the infant vaccine (e.g., the
limit of flocculation [Lf] units of 
diphtheria toxoid, aluminum hydroxide-adsorbed, or fluid preparation), and the length
of the interval between 
doses 
(229,237,292,293,295,
299,321,328--331). Infants typically respond with increases in antitoxin after 2 doses of 
high-content diphtheria toxoid vaccine when maternal antitoxin concentrations are 0.1
IU/mL in cord sera but not until after
>3  infant  doses  of  high-content  diphtheria  toxoid  vaccine  when  maternal  antitoxin
concentrations are
>1.0 IU/mL in cord sera 
(225,229,292,299,321,329,331,332). When infants 
receive subsequent doses of diphtheria toxoid, the responses are 
rapid, often within 2 weeks (330), suggesting that T-cell priming occurs in the absence
of an infant antibody response to 
previous doses of vaccine 
(229,237,324,329,330).
 Lactation  Consumption of human milk does not affect the infant 
immune response to diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccines (292,332). Ingestion of colostrum from an immune mother does not result in
an increase in the concentration of 
diphtheria antitoxin in infant sera (250).
 Both Tdap vaccines used in the United States 
(ADACEL® and 
BOOSTRIX®) were licensed on the basis of clinical trials 
in the United States demonstrating immunogenicity not inferior to that of U.S.-licensed
Td 
(333,334)  and  the  pertussis  components  of  pediatric  DTaP  made  by  the  same
manufacturer and an acceptable safety profile 
(212,213). Adsorbed Td products for adults and adolescents have been licensed in the
United States since the 1950s 
(335). Components of these and other diphtheria and tetanus 
toxoids--containing vaccines have been listed (Table 1) and are available at 
http://www.fda.gov/cber/vaccines.htm  .   In  prelicensure  trials,  data  on  local  and
systemic adverse events were collected using standard diaries for the day 
of vaccination and the next 14 consecutive days 
(212,213,336--338). The efficacies of the tetanus toxoid and the 
diphtheria  toxoid  components  of  Tdap  were  inferred  from  the  immunogenicity  of  the
antigens in Tdap compared with Td 
using  established  serologic  correlates  of  protection  in  sera  obtained  before  and
approximately 1 month after vaccination. Because 
no  well-accepted  serologic  or  laboratory  correlate  of  protection  is  available  for
pertussis, the efficacy of the pertussis 
components of Tdap was inferred using a serologic bridge (comparison) to the immune
response to vaccine antigens among infants 
who  received  3  doses  of  pediatric  DTaP  (made  by  the  same  manufacturer)  during
clinical efficacy trials for pertussis during 
the 1990s (339). The efficacy against pertussis of an acellular pertussis vaccine without
tetanus and diphtheria toxoids was 
92% (CI = 32%--99%) for adults and adolescents in a randomized, controlled trial 
(340); these results were not considered in 
the  evaluation  of  Tdap  for  licensure  in  the  United  States.   Selected  results  from  the
prelicensure  trials  are  summarized  below.  Additional  information  can  be  found  in
previous 
ACIP  statements  discussing  use  of  Tdap  among  adults  and  adolescents  and  in  the
package labels of the specific products 
(1,2,212,213).
 ADACEL®   ADACEL®  contains  the  same  tetanus  toxoid,  diphtheria  toxoid,  and  five
pertussis antigens as those in 
DAPTACEL® (pediatric DTaP, also made by sanofi pasteur), but 
ADACEL® is formulated with reduced quantities of diphtheria toxoid 
and detoxified PT. Prelicensure trials in the United States evaluated the immunogenicity
and the safety of 
ADACEL® among 
adults  aged  18--64  years  and  among  adolescents  aged  11--17  years,  randomized  to
receive a single dose of 
ADACEL® or a single dose of Td made by the same manufacturer (Table 1) 
(1,2,212,333). Pregnant women were excluded.
 Immunogenicity   Tetanus  and  Diphtheria  Toxoids.  The  rates  of  seroprotection  and
booster response for both antitetanus and 
antidiphtheria among adults and adolescents who received a single dose of 
ADACEL® were noninferior to rates among those who 
received Td. Nearly all (>99%) subjects in the 
ADACEL® and Td groups achieved seroprotective antitetanus levels 
(>0.1 IU/mL), and >94% of adults and >99% of 
adolescents achieved seroprotective antidiphtheria levels 
(>0.1 IU/mL) in ADACEL® and 
Td groups (212,341).
 Pertussis  Antigens.  The  efficacy  of  the  pertussis  components  was  inferred  by
comparing the immune responses (GMCs) 
of adults and adolescents vaccinated with a single dose of 
ADACEL® to those of infants vaccinated with 3 doses 
of DAPTACEL® in a Swedish vaccine efficacy trial 
(338,342). The efficacy of 3 doses of pediatric 
DAPTACEL® against WHO-defined pertussis 
(>21 days of paroxysmal cough with confirmation of 
B. pertussis infection by culture or serologic testing, 
or an epidemiologic link to a household member with culture-confirmed pertussis) was
85% (CI = 80%--89%) 
(338,342).  The  GMCs  of  anti-PT,  anti-FHA,  anti-PRN,  and  anti-FIM  among  adults  and
adolescents after a single dose of 
ADACEL® were noninferior to those of infants after 3 doses of 
DAPTACEL.® The prespecified criteria 
for booster responses also were met 
(1,2,212,336,341).
 Safety  The safety of ADACEL® was evaluated in four clinical studies with data from
2,448 adults aged 18--64 years and 
3,393 adolescents aged 11--17 years (212).
 Immediate  Events.  No  anaphylaxis  was  reported.  Five  adults  reported  an  immediate
event within 30 minutes of 
vaccination (four persons [0.2%] for ADACEL® and one person [0.2%] for Td); three of
these five events were classified as 
nervous system disorders (hypoesthesia/paresthesia). Eleven adolescents reported an
immediate event (six persons [0.5%] 
for ADACEL® and five persons [0.6%] for Td); these events included dizziness, syncope,
or vasovagal reactions in addition 
to pain and erythema at the injection site. All events 
resolved without sequelae (338,341,343).
 Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events. Rates of erythema and swelling 
(Figures 3 and 4), or systemic (headache, generalized body aches, and tiredness [data
not presented]) adverse events reported to occur during 0--14 days 
following vaccination with Td or Tdap were similar 
(1,2,212,338,341). Fever 
>100.4°F 
(>38°C) was reported with the same 
frequency by adults vaccinated with Td and with Tdap (Figure 3) 
(212); the rate of any fever reported by adolescents vaccinated 
with Tdap (5%) was higher than the rate for those vaccinated with Td (3%) but met the
noninferiority  criterion  (Figure  4)  (212,341).  No  case  of  whole-arm  swelling  was
reported 
(341).
 Serious  Adverse  Events.  Among  adults,  serious  adverse  events  (e.g.,  appendicitis)
within 6 months after vaccination 
were reported for 33 (2%) of 1,752 persons in the ADACEL® group and for 11 (2%) of
573 persons in the Td group 
(338,341). Two serious adverse events in 
ADACEL®  recipients  were  neuropathic  and  were  assessed  by  the  investigators  as
possibly 
related to vaccination. In both cases, the symptoms resolved completely over several
days 
(1,212,338,  341,343).  Among  adolescents,  serious  adverse  events  within  6  months
after vaccination were reported for 11 (1%) of 1,184 persons in the 
ADACEL®  group  and  for  eight  (1%)  of  792  persons  in  the  Td  group.  All  events  were
reported by investigators to be unrelated to the 
study  vaccine  (341).  No  physician-diagnosed  Arthus  reaction  (see  Important  Local
Reactions) or case of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome (see Neurologic and Systemic Events) was reported 
(1).
 Simultaneous Administration of Tdap with Other 
Vaccines  Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine. The safety and immunogenicity of 
ADACEL® co-administered with 
trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine ([TIV] 
Fluzone,® sanofi pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) were evaluated in nonpregnant 
adults aged 19--64 years randomized to simultaneous administration in different arms
(n = 359), or to TIV administered 
first, followed by ADACEL® 4--6 weeks later (n = 361). Rates of fever and injection site
erythema and swelling were 
similar following ADACEL® administered concurrently with TIV or separately. Pain at the
ADACEL® injection site occurred 
more  frequently  after  simultaneous  administration  than  after  separate  administration
(67% and 61%, respectively) 
(338).  Immunogenicity  criteria  were  met  with  the  following  exceptions:  the  GMC  of
anti-PRN was lower in the simultaneous 
group than in the sequential group (338,344), and the tetanus booster response rates
were lower after simultaneous 
administration 
than after sequential administration (79% and 83%, respectively). However, more than
98% of subjects in both 
groups achieved seroprotective levels (>0.1 IU/mL) of tetanus antitoxin 
(338,344).
 Hepatitis B Vaccine. The safety and immunogenicity of 
ADACEL® administered with hepatitis B (Hep B) 
vaccine  (Recombivax  HB,®  Merck  and  Co.,  White  House  Station,  New  Jersey)  were
evaluated among nonpregnant adolescents 
aged 11--14 years randomized to simultaneous administration (n = 206) or to 
ADACEL® administered first, followed by 
hepatitis B vaccine 4--6 weeks later (n = 204). Rates of solicited erythema and swelling
at the 
ADACEL® injection site were higher 
in  the  simultaneous  group  than  in  the  sequential  group,  and  noninferiority  was  not
achieved 
(1,338). No interference was observed in the immune responses to any of the vaccine
antigens when 
ADACEL® and hepatitis B vaccine were 
administered concurrently or separately 
(212).
 BOOSTRIX®   BOOSTRIX®  contains  the  same  tetanus  toxoid,  diphtheria  toxoid,  and
three pertussis antigens as those in 
INFANRIX® (pediatric DTaP, also made by 
GlaxoSmithKline), but BOOSTRIX® is formulated with reduced quantities of 
antigens.
 Prelicensure
 trials
 conducted
 in
 the
 United
 States
 evaluated
 the
immunogenicity and safety of 
BOOSTRIX® among adolescents aged 10--18 years 
(213,337), randomized to receive a single dose of 
BOOSTRIX®  or  a  single  dose  of  Td  (Massachusetts  Public  Health  Biologic  Laboratory,
Mattapan, Massachusetts) (Table 1) 
(213,334,337). Pregnant adolescents were excluded.
 Immunogenicity   Tetanus  and  Diphtheria  Toxoids.  The  rates  of  seroprotection  and
booster response for both antitetanus and 
antidiphtheria among adolescents who received a single dose of 
BOOSTRIX® were noninferior to those who received 
Td. All adolescents had seroprotective antitetanus levels 
(>0.1 IU/mL); >99% of adolescents had seroprotective antidiphtheria levels 
(>0.1 IU/mL) (1,213,336).
 Pertussis  Antigens.  The  efficacy  of  the  pertussis  components  was  inferred  by
comparing the immune responses 
of adolescents vaccinated with a single dose of 
BOOSTRIX® with the immune responses of infants vaccinated with 3 doses 
of INFANRIX® in a German vaccine efficacy trial 
(213,336, 345). The efficacy of 3 doses of pediatric 
INFANRIX® against WHO-defined pertussis was 89% (CI = 77%--95%) 
(213,345). The GMCs of anti-PT, anti-FHA, and anti-PRN after 
a single dose of BOOSTRIX® were noninferior to those of infants after 3 doses of 
INFANRIX.® The prespecified criteria 
for booster responses also were met 
(1,213,336,337).
 Safety  A total of 3,080 adolescents aged 10--18 years received 
BOOSTRIX® in the primary safety study 
(213).  No  immediate  events  (i.e.,  those  occurring  within  30  minutes  of  vaccination)
were reported 
(1,213,336,337).
 Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events. No substantial differences were observed
between  the  BOOSTRIX®  and  Td  recipients  in  the  rates  of  solicited  local  (redness,
swelling, and increase in arm circumference above baseline) 
(Figure 5) or systemic (headache, fatigue, gastrointestinal systemic events, fever 
>100.4°F 
[>38.0°C] [data not presented]) adverse 
events (1,213,336,337). No case of whole-arm swelling was reported 
(1).
 Serious Adverse Events. Serious adverse events within 
6 months after vaccination were reported among 14 (0.4%) of 
3,005  adolescents  vaccinated  with  BOOSTRIX®  and  two  (0.2%)  of  1,003  adolescents
vaccinated with Td. All events were 
reported by the investigators to be unrelated to the study vaccine 
(213,336,337,346). No physician-diagnosed Arthus reaction or 
case of Guillain-Barré syndrome was reported 
(1,213,337,346).
 Pregnant  Women  Vaccinated  with  Tdap   Pregnant  women  were  excluded  from
prelicensure trials of Tdap. The outcome of pregnancy among six women who 
were administered ADACEL® inadvertently during or within 1 month of conception was
a healthy full-term infant (n = 3), 
a preterm infant (n = 1), or a miscarriage (n = 2). No infant was born with a congenital
anomaly (sanofi-pasteur, 
unreported data, 2007). Two pregnancies occurred in 
BOOSTRIX® recipients >4 months postvaccination; one subject experienced 
a  spontaneous  abortion  within  the  first  trimester,  and  the  other  subject  delivered  a
healthy infant 
(337).
 Regulatory Considerations for Tdap in Pregnant 
Women  As with the majority of vaccines, Tdap is labeled pregnancy category C. This
designation indicates that no adequate 
and well-controlled studies have been conducted with the vaccine in pregnant women
to determine the product's safety 
(347,348).
 Prelicensure  studies  in  nonpregnant  adults  and  adolescents  evaluated  the  safety  of
Tdap with respect to local and 
systemic  adverse  events  (212,213).  The  sample  sizes  were  insufficient  to  detect  rare
adverse events. Enrollment criteria excluded 
persons  who  were  pregnant;  had  received  vaccines  containing  tetanus  toxoid,
diphtheria toxoid, or pertussis components more 
recently than either the preceding 5 years for 
ADACEL® (212) or the preceding 10 years for 
BOOSTRIX® (213); or had 
certain neurologic conditions or events 
(336--338,341,346). Safety data are being collected by the Vaccine Adverse Event 
Reporting System (VAERS), and postlicensure studies continue to monitor for potential
adverse reactions following widespread use 
of  Tdap  in  adults  and  adolescents  (16,17).  Registries  have  been  established  by  both
Tdap manufacturers for reporting 
women vaccinated with Tdap during pregnancy.  Interval between Td and Tdap  ACIP
has made several recommendations for intervals 
between tetanus toxoid-- and diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccines  that  balance  the  benefits  of  protection  against  the  risks  of  moderate  and
severe local reactions. Moderate and severe 
local reactions, including Arthus reaction, are associated with frequent dosing at short
intervals and larger doses of toxoid. 
High antitoxin levels are more likely to result when the interval between doses is short
and the number of doses increases 
(349--354).  High  preexisting  antibody  titers  to  tetanus  or  diphtheria  toxoids  also  are
associated with increased rates and severity 
of local reactions to booster doses in adults 
(349,354--356).
 ACIP recommends a 10-year interval for routine administration of Td (e.g., decennial Td
booster), and a 5-year interval 
for Td when indicated for wounds management 
(1,2,357). Administering Td more often than every 10 years (5 years for 
certain  nonclean,  nonminor  wounds)  is  not  necessary  to  provide  protection  against
tetanus or diphtheria; however, 
administering a single dose of Tdap at an interval shorter than 5 years after Td could
provide a health benefit by adding protection 
against pertussis (Table 2) (1,2). When Tdap is 
administered to add protection against pertussis, ACIP encourages an interval of
>5  years  between  the  most  recent  Td  and  the  Tdap  dose  for  adolescents  because
they might receive other recommended 
vaccines
 containing
 tetanus
 or
 diphtheria
 toxoids
 (including
 quadrivalent
meningococcal conjugate vaccine [MCV4] 
[Menactra,® sanofi pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania]) 
(2). An interval as short as 2 years is recommended between the most recent Td 
and the single dose of Tdap for health-care personnel with direct patient contact, and a 
2-year interval between the most recent Td and Tdap is suggested for adults in close
contact with infants 
(1). ACIP allows for a shorter interval between the most 
recent Td and administration of Tdap in certain circumstances that might require urgent
protection 
(1,2).
 Several studies have suggested that an interval as short as 
2 years between Td and a single dose of Tdap is acceptably safe. 
Three  studies  conducted  among  Canadian  children  and  adolescents  evaluated  the
safety of Tdap 
(ADACEL®) at an interval shorter than 5 years after Td or after pediatric DTP or DTaP 
(358--360). The largest was an open-label study of 7,001 students aged 
7--19 years. Rates of local reactions were not increased 
among students who had received the most recent of 5 pediatric DTP 
or DTaP doses, or a Td dose, >2 years before Tdap, compared with >10 years before
Tdap (358). The other Canadian 
studies demonstrated similar safety when Tdap was administered at an interval of <5
years after the previous 
tetanus toxoid-- and diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccine (359,360).
 Adverse reactions after Tdap 
(ADACEL®)  administered  at  an  interval  of  <2  years  from  the  most  recent  Td  were
evaluated in 
a retrospective survey of 4,524 health-care personnel who received Tdap at a median
age of 46 years during an outbreak 
of pertussis-like illness in New Hampshire in 2006 
(118,215,361). For the 2,676 (59%) responses, the rates of 
reactions were analyzed by interval from Td to Tdap as either >2 years (n = 1,792) or
<2 years (n = 370). The rates of pain, redness, or 
swelling of moderate or severe intensity, subjective fever, and medical visits were not
higher among respondents with an interval of <2 
years  between  administration  of  Td  and  that  of  Tdap.  Three  serious  adverse  events
were reported among adults who received Tdap 
at an interval >2 years after the most recent dose of Td; causality was not assessed.
The events were a case of 
Guillain-Barré syndrome (not requiring hospitalization) with onset 11 days after Tdap, a
case of anaphylaxis-like reaction with onset 6 days 
after 
Tdap, and a case of eosinophilic nephritis with onset 6 days after Tdap in a health-care
worker with a history of a renal 
transplant (215,216).
 Important Local Reactions
 Arthus Reaction  Arthus reaction (type III hypersensitivity reaction) can 
occur after tetanus toxoid-- or diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccines  (354,357,362--366;  CDC,  unpublished  data,  2005).  Arthus  reaction  is  a  local
vasculitis with deposition 
of  immune  complexes  and  activation  of  complement;  it  occurs  in  the  setting  of  high
local concentration of vaccine antigens 
and high circulating antibody concentration (354,362, 
363,367). The reaction is characterized by severe pain, swelling, 
induration, edema, and hemorrhage, and occasionally by local necrosis. Vaccine-related
arthus reaction typically resolves without 
sequelae. The onset of symptoms and signs is 4--12 hours after vaccination, compared
with anaphylaxis (immediate type 
I  hypersensitivity  reaction),  which  has  onset  within  minutes  after  vaccination.  ACIP
recommends that persons who 
experience an Arthus reaction after administration of a 
tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine not receive Td or other 
tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine more frequently than 
every 10 years, even for tetanus prophylaxis as part of wound management 
(1,357).
 Extensive  Limb  Swelling   Extensive  limb  swelling  reactions  have  been  reported  to
VAERS following administration of Td 
(368,369) and are described following dose 4 or dose 5 of pediatric DTaP 
(23,208,368,370--373). Extensive limb swelling after pediatric DTaP 
resolves without complication within 4--7 days 
(370), and is not considered a precaution or contraindication for Tdap 
(23).
 Neurologic and Systemic Events  Pertussis Components  Concerns regarding a possible
role of pertussis vaccine components in causing neurologic reactions or 
exacerbating underlying neurologic conditions in infants and children are long-standing 
(29,374). In 1991, the Institute of 
Medicine  (IOM)  concluded  that  evidence  favored  acceptance  of  a  causal  relation
between pediatric DTP vaccine and 
acute encephalopathy (365). A subsequent retrospective analysis of >2 million children
in the United States did not 
demonstrate that pediatric DTP was associated with an increased risk for 
encephalopathy after vaccination (375). Active surveillance 
in  Canada  during  1993--2002  also  failed  to  identify  any  acute  encephalopathy  cases
causally related to whole-cell or 
acellular  pertussis  vaccines  among  a  population  administered  6.5  million  doses  of
pertussis-containing vaccines 
(376). Results of one recent investigation suggested that some acute encephalopathies 
attributed previously to pertussis-containing vaccines could 
be the result of genetically determined epileptic encephalopathies related to mutations
in the sodium channel gene 
SCN1A (377,378). A history of encephalopathy (e.g., coma or prolonged seizures) not
attributable to an identifiable cause within 
7  days  of  administration  of  a  vaccine  with  pertussis  components  remains  a
contraindication for Tdap (but not Td) in adults 
and adolescents.  The possibility that Tdap would complicate neurologic evaluation of
chronic progressive neurologic disorders that are 
stable in adults (e.g., dementia) is of limited clinical concern and does not constitute a
reason to delay administration of Tdap 
(1).  Unstable  or  evolving  neurologic  conditions  (e.g.,  cerebrovascular  events  or  acute
encephalopathic conditions) would be 
reason to delay administration of Tdap until the condition has stabilized 
(1). Among adolescents who have progressive 
or uncontrolled underlying neurologic disease, concerns regarding administering Tdap
must be weighed against the 
morbidity from pertussis, which could be severe 
(2). ACIP does not consider a history of well-controlled seizures or a family history 
of seizures (febrile or afebrile) or other neurologic disorder to be a contraindication or
precaution to vaccination with 
pertussis components (22).
 Tetanus  Toxoid  Component   ACIP  considers  Guillain-Barré  syndrome  within  6  weeks
after receipt of a tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine to be 
a precaution (see Precautions and Reasons to Defer Td or 
Tdap) for administration of subsequent tetanus 
toxoid--containing  vaccines  (23).  Although  IOM  concluded  that  evidence  favored
acceptance of a causal relation between tetanus 
toxoid--containing vaccines and Guillain-Barré syndrome on the 
basis of a single well-documented case 
(365,379), subsequent 
analysis  of  data  from  both  adult  and  pediatric  populations  failed  to  demonstrate  an
association 
(380). As of January 29, 2007, eight patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome temporally
associated with receipt of Tdap or of Tdap administered on the 
same  day  with  other  vaccines  had  been  reported  to  VAERS.  The  onsets  were  not
clustered by the interval since vaccination or by 
a single pattern of vaccine exposure (361).
 ACIP  does  not  consider  a  history  of  brachial  neuritis  to  be  a  precaution  or
contraindication for administration of 
tetanus  toxoid--containing  vaccines  (23,381).  IOM  concluded  that  evidence  from  case
reports and uncontrolled studies 
involving tetanus toxoid--containing vaccines did favor a causal 
relation between tetanus toxoid--containing vaccines and brachial 
neuritis (365); however, brachial neuritis typically is self-limited 
(23,381). Brachial neuritis is a compensable event through the 
Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) 
(365).
 No  study  has  evaluated  the  disease  morbidity  and  societal  costs  associated  with
pertussis among pregnant women 
or  modeled  the  cost  benefit  or  cost  effectiveness  of  a  Tdap  strategy  that  includes
vaccination of pregnant women. The 
morbidity and societal cost of pertussis in adults is substantial 
(1,2). A retrospective assessment of medical costs of confirmed pertussis 
in  936  adults  in  Massachusetts  during  1998--2000,  and  a  prospective  assessment  of
nonmedical costs in 203 adults during 
2001--2003  (31)  indicated  that  the  mean  medical  and  nonmedical  cost  per  case  was
$326 and $447, respectively, for a societal 
cost of $773. If the cost of antimicrobials to treat contacts and the cost of personal time
were included, the 
societal cost could be as high as $1,952 per adult case (31).
 Cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses of adult Tdap vaccination have varied in
their results 
(382,383).  When  discrepancies  in  the  models  were  addressed,  an  adult  Tdap
vaccination program was cost-effective when incidence of 
pertussis exceeded 120 cases per 100,000 population, using a benchmark of $50,000
per quality-adjusted life year saved 
(384--386). After adjusting for the severity of the illness at high disease incidence, little
effect was observed on the overall cost effectiveness of 
a vaccination program. Similar results were obtained when program costs and benefits
were analyzed over the lifetime of the 
adult cohort for decennial booster strategies 
(1,387).
 Preconception  Assessments   Administering  a  dose  of  Tdap  during  routine  wellness
visits of adult and adolescent women of childbearing age, if 
indicated,  is  the  most  effective  programmatic  strategy  to  ensure  that  women  are
protected against pertussis in addition to tetanus 
and  diphtheria  and  minimizes  any  theoretical  effect  of  vaccination  on  infant  immune
responses should the woman 
become pregnant (see Immunity to Pertussis and Kinetics of 
Pertussis Booster Vaccination in Nonpregnant Adults and 
Adolescents)  (1,388--392).  Because  Tdap  contains  only  toxoids  and  purified  bacterial
components, women who receive Tdap do not 
need to wait after vaccination to become pregnant 
(23). Assessments provide repeated opportunities for documenting the history 
of  past  doses  of  Td  (or  TT)  and  any  serious  adverse  reactions  to  tetanus,  diphtheria,
and pertussis vaccines. To access 
and  maintain  immunization  records,  state-based  immunization  information  systems
(IIS) are increasingly becoming available 
to  clinicians  and  public  health  officials.  These  confidential,  computerized  information
systems, which consolidate 
vaccination data from multiple health-care providers, can generate reminder and 
recall notifications, assist with vaccine management 
and adverse events reporting, and capture lifespan vaccination histories 
(393). Additional guidance regarding administration 
of vaccines during routine assessments, record keeping, vaccine storage, and 
related topics has been published previously 
(23).
 Prenatal Visits: Deferring Td During Pregnancy to Substitute Tdap in 
the Immediate Postpartum Period  In 2004, a total of 96% of pregnant women started
prenatal care in the first or second trimester 
(394). Prenatal visits provide additional opportunities for assessing the history of past
vaccination with Tdap, Td, or TT and any 
serious adverse reactions to tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines. Women who
have not received a previous dose of Tdap can 
be 
advised that ACIP recommends Tdap postpartum before discharge from the hospital or
birthing center to provide 
personal protection and reduce the risk for transmitting pertussis to their infants.
 Health-care providers can monitor pregnant women for respiratory illness consistent
with pertussis or for recent exposure 
to  pertussis,  either  to  themselves  or  to  family  members,  and  prescribe  a  macrolide
antimicrobial for treatment of pertussis 
or  postexposure  prophylaxis,  if  indicated.  Women  and  their  partners  should  receive
counseling regarding the severity of 
infant  pertussis  and  ACIP's  recommendation  for  a  single  dose  of  Tdap  for  adults  and
adolescents who anticipate contact with 
an infant (1,2). In a 2005 national survey of obstetricians, 72% of respondents affirmed
the belief that 
obstetricians,  pediatricians,  adult  primary  care  providers,  and  public  health  providers
share responsibility to promote 
administration  of  Tdap  for  adults  who  anticipate  contact  with  an  infant,  including
fathers and close relatives 
(395).  Ideally,  health-care  providers  delivering  prenatal  care  will  encourage  persons
likely to have contact with an infant, including child care providers, to 
receive  Tdap  first.   When  pregnant  women  who  have  not  received  Tdap  have
indications for tetanus or diphtheria booster 
protection (>10 years since the most recent Td), ACIP recommends 
receipt of Td during pregnancy (Table 2). ACIP has 
developed criteria for safely deferring administration of Td until delivery among women
who have received past tetanus 
toxoid--containing vaccinations, so the majority of these women can substitute Tdap in
the immediate postpartum period 
for Td during pregnancy (see Deferring Td During Pregnancy to Substitute Tdap in the
Immediate Postpartum Period). When 
the  history  of  tetanus  toxoid  vaccination  for  the  women  is  uncertain  or  lacking,
health-care providers can determine 
the  concentration  of  tetanus  antitoxin  to  ensure  protective  concentrations  of  tetanus
antitoxin 
(>0.1  IU/mL  by  ELISA).  Because  diphtheria  is  rare  in  the  United  States,  serologic
screening for diphtheria antitoxin typically is not necessary. A woman 
who anticipates travel to an area in which diphtheria is 
endemic can improve protection against diphtheria by receiving a 
booster dose of Td during pregnancy or a dose of Tdap postpartum. Serologic screening
to establish immunity to pertussis is 
not useful.  In special situations in which a pregnant woman has 
increased risk for tetanus, diphtheria, or pertussis, 
ACIP acknowledges that health-care providers may choose to 
administer Tdap instead of Td during pregnancy to add 
protection against pertussis, after discussing the theoretical benefits and risks for her,
her fetus, and the pregnancy outcome with 
the woman before vaccination (see Considerations for Use of Tdap in Pregnant Women
in Special Situations). Data to inform 
this decision are scarce. No theoretical risk for harm to the mother or fetus exists from
Tdap, and administration of Tdap in 
the pregnant woman might provide a degree of early protection to the infant against
pertussis. However, a theoretical risk for 
the  infant  is  that  the  dose  of  Tdap  in  pregnancy  might  not  result  in  early  protection
against pertussis or could 
increase  transplacental  pertussis-specific  antibodies  to  levels  that  would  have  a
negative effect on the infant's response to 
immunization with pediatric DTaP or with conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid
or diphtheria toxoid (e.g.,
Haemophilus influenzae type b pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) 
(222). Health-care providers who choose to vaccinate pregnant women with Tdap 
are encouraged to report such administration to the manufacturers' pregnancy registry.
 Postpartum  Tdap   In  2004,  a  reported  99%  of  live  births  in  the  United  States
occurred in a hospital. Of out-of-hospital live births, 
27% occurred at a free-standing birthing center and 65% at a residence 
(394). In these settings, attendants can implement 
protocols  to  ensure  that  postpartum  women  who  have  not  received  Tdap  previously
receive it before discharge. They also can 
encourage previously unvaccinated adults and adolescents who anticipate contact with
an infant to receive Tdap. Tdap vaccination of 
the women and potential contacts before discharge rather than at a follow-up visit has
the advantage of decreasing the time 
when new mothers and contacts of the newborns could 
acquire and transmit pertussis to the infants 
(1,2).  Standing  orders  for  postpartum  Tdap  vaccination  before  discharge  have
successfully raised vaccination rates to more than 80% of 
eligible women (396). Although obtaining a history of the most recent Td vaccination
was anticipated to be a barrier to 
postpartum vaccination with Tdap, in practice it was not identified as a barrier 
(395,396).
 Vaccination  of  parents  and  household  contacts  of  premature  infants  has  been
advocated to ensure that such persons 
receive  Tdap  (397).  Premature  and  low  birth  weight  infants  are  at  increased  risk  for
severe and complicated pertussis. The 
case-fatality rate for pertussis is increased compared with term infants, and premature
infants might respond less well than term infants 
to  initial  doses  of  DTaP  vaccine  because  of  comorbidities  or  treatments  (e.g.,
dexamethasone) 
(47,53, 398--403).
 Parents should be reminded of other measures to protect infants from pertussis. To the
extent feasible, parents can 
limit infant exposures to persons who have respiratory illness until they are determined
to be noninfectious 
(99,219,321).  When  pertussis  exposure  occurs,  antimicrobial  prophylaxis  of  exposed
contacts can be effective in preventing transmission 
of pertussis (42,99,404,405). Ensuring that infants begin the pediatric DTaP vaccination
series at the recommended chronologic age of 
6--8 weeks is critical to protection and reducing the severity of pertussis 
(8,45,397,406). Administration of 2 or 3 doses of pediatric 
DTP or DTaP can prevent hospitalization for pertussis and its complications 
(5,8,407--409).
 Recommendations for routine use of Td and Tdap among women of childbearing age
who might become pregnant 
have been published previously (1,2) and have been summarized (Table 2). Women are
encouraged to receive a single dose of 
Tdap either as ADACEL® (adults and adolescents aged 
11--64 years) or as BOOSTRIX® (adolescents aged 11--18 years) 
before conception (e.g., during routine wellness visits) if they have not already received
Tdap. Recommendations for adults 
and  adolescents  who  anticipate  or  have  household  contact  with  an  infant  aged  <12
months also have been published 
previously (1,2) and summarized (Table 2). The dose of Tdap will provide active booster
immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, 
and pertussis and will replace the next dose of Td 
according to routine recommendations. A single preconception dose of Tdap 
will  prevent  pertussis,  reduce  morbidity  associated  with  pertussis,  and  might  prevent
exposing persons at increased risk 
for pertussis and its complications, including infants. The risk for pertussis death and
severe pertussis is highest among infants 
in the first months of life and remains elevated until an infant has received 1--2 doses
of 
pediatric DTaP (8,45,47).
 The  following  sections  present  recommendations  for  use  of  Td  and  Tdap  among
pregnant and postpartum 
women,  including  routine  vaccination,  contraindications,  precautions,  and  special
situations. As with most inactivated vaccines 
and toxoids, pregnancy is not a contraindication for use of Tdap. Although the safety
and immunogenicity of Tdap is expected 
to be similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women, few data on the safety of Tdap for
women, fetuses, and pregnancy 
outcomes are available, and no information is available on the immunogenicity of Tdap
in pregnant women. Vaccinating 
pregnant  women  with  a  single  dose  of  Tdap  might  provide  a  degree  of  protection
against pertussis to the infant in early life 
through  transplacental  maternal  antibody,  but  evidence  supporting  this  hypothesis  is
lacking. A concern is the unknown effect 
of potential interference by maternal antibody on the ability of the infant to mount an
adequate immune response when 
the infant receives pediatric DTaP or conjugate vaccines containing tetanus toxoid or
diphtheria toxoid.
 In special situations, administration of Tdap during pregnancy might be warranted
for pregnant women who were 
not  vaccinated  previously  with  Tdap.  Health-care  providers  who  choose  to  administer
Tdap to pregnant women should 
discuss with the women the potential risks and benefits of 
immunization including the lack of data on Tdap administered 
during pregnancy or its unknown effects on active immunization 
of their infant. The following recommendations are intended 
to  provide  guidance  to  clinicians  until  additional  information  is  available.   1.  Routine
Tdap Vaccination  1-A. Recommendations for Use of Postpartum Tdap  For women who
have not received Tdap previously (including women who are breastfeeding), Tdap is
recommended 
as  soon  as  feasible  in  the  immediate  postpartum  period  to  protect  the  women  from
pertussis and reduce the risk for 
exposing their infants to pertussis. The postpartum Tdap should be administered before
discharge from the hospital or birthing 
center.  If  Tdap  cannot  be  administered  at  or  before  discharge,  the  dose  should  be
administered as soon as feasible thereafter. 
Elevated levels of pertussis antibodies in the mother are likely within 1--2 weeks after
vaccination.
 Although  an  interval  of  10  years  since  receipt  of  the  most  recent  Td  dose  is
recommended for the next routine Td 
booster, to reduce the risk for women exposing their infants to pertussis, an interval as
short as 2 years 
between the most recent Td and administering 
Tdap¶ is suggested for postpartum women. The safety of such an interval is supported
by three 
Canadian  studies  among  adolescents  and  by  a  study  among  nonpregnant  adult
health-care personnel 
(215,358--360),  an  interval  shorter  than  2  years  may  be  used  (see  Postpartum  Tdap
When <2 Years Have Elapsed Since the Most Recent Td). In this setting, 
the benefit of Tdap to protect against pertussis typically outweighs the risk for local and
systemic reactions after 
vaccination. 
Routine  postpartum  Tdap  recommendations  are  supported  by  evidence  from
randomized controlled clinical 
trials,  nonrandomized  open-label  trials  and  a  retrospective  survey,  observational
studies, and 
expert opinion (Box 2).
 1-B. Dosage and Administration  The dose of Tdap or, if indicated, the dose of Td is 0.5
mL, administered intramuscularly (IM), preferably into 
the deltoid muscle.  1-C. Simultaneous Vaccination with Tdap and Other Vaccines  If two
or more vaccines are indicated, they typically should be administered during the same
visit (i.e., 
simultaneous  vaccination).  Each  vaccine  should  be  administered  using  a  separate
syringe at a different anatomic site. Certain 
experts recommend administering no more than two injections per muscle, separated
by at least one inch. Administering all 
indicated  vaccines  during  a  single  visit  increases  the  likelihood  that  pregnant  and
postpartum women will receive 
recommended vaccinations (23). 
 1-D. Interchangeable Use of Tdap Vaccines  A single dose of ADACEL® may be used for
adults aged 19--64 years, and a single dose of either 
ADACEL® or 
BOOSTRIX® may be used for adolescents aged 11--18 years, regardless of the type or
manufacturer of pediatric DTP 
or  pediatric  DTaP  used  for  childhood  vaccination.   1-E.  Preventing  Adverse  Events  
Attention  to  proper  immunization  technique,  including  use  of  an  appropriate  needle
length and standard routes 
of administration (i.e., IM for Td and Tdap) might minimize the risk for adverse events.
Guidance for administration of 
vaccines is available (23).
 Syncope can occur after vaccination and might be more common among young adults
and adolescents than among 
other age groups. Syncope rarely has resulted in serious injury 
(23,410--412). Vaccine providers should strongly consider 
observing patients for 15 minutes after they are vaccinated 
(23,412). If syncope occurs, patients should be observed 
until symptoms resolve.
 1-F. Inadvertent Administration of Pediatric DTaP, 
BOOSTRIX® Tdap, or Purified 
Protein  Derivative  (PPD)   The  potential  for  administration  errors  involving  tetanus
toxoid--containing vaccines 
(413) and other vaccines is well-documented 
(414--416). Pediatric DTaP and pediatric diphtheria toxoid and tetanus toxoid vaccine
(DT) 
formulations  indicated  for  use  in  children  aged  6  weeks--6  years  should  not  be
administered to adults or adolescents; these vaccines can 
be associated with more severe local reactions than adult formulations 
(350,417). Packaging of adult and adolescent 
Tdap  vaccines,  pediatric  DTaP,  and  purified  protein  derivative  (PPD)  might  appear
similar. Only one formulation of 
Tdap, ADACEL,® is licensed and recommended for adults aged 
19--64 years. Both formulations of Tdap 
(BOOSTRIX® and 
ADACEL®) are licensed and recommended for adolescents aged 11--18 years. Providers
should review product 
labels before administering these vaccines. If pediatric DTaP is 
administered inadvertently to an adult or adolescent, or 
if BOOSTRIX® is administered inadvertently to an adult aged 
>19 years, the dose should be counted as the Tdap dose, and 
the  person  should  not  receive  an  additional  dose  of  Tdap.  Adults  or  adolescents  who
receive PPD instead of Tdap should receive 
a dose of Tdap.  1-G. Record Keeping  Health-care providers who administer vaccines to
adults and adolescents are required to keep permanent vaccination 
records of vaccines covered under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation
Act. ACIP has recommended that 
this practice include all vaccines (23). Encouraging adults and adolescents to maintain
a personal vaccination record 
is  important  to  minimize  administration  of  unnecessary  vaccinations.  Ideally,  the
personal vaccine record will document the 
type of the vaccine, manufacturer, anatomic site, route, and date of administration, and
the name of the administering facility 
(23).
 2. Contraindications and Precautions for Use of Td and Tdap  2-A. Contraindications 
The  following  conditions  are  contraindications  for  Td  or  Tdap:    2-B.  Precautions  and
Reasons  to  Defer  Td  or  Tdap   A  precaution  is  a  condition  in  a  vaccine  recipient  that
might increase the risk for a serious adverse reaction 
(23).  In  the  following  situations,  vaccine  providers  should  evaluate  the  risks  and
benefits of administering Td or Tdap:
  2-C. Conditions Under Which Td or Tdap May Be Administered If Otherwise Indicated
 The following conditions are not contraindications or precautions for Td or Tdap:
  Latex allergies other than anaphylactic allergies (e.g., a history of contact allergy to
latex gloves) are not a contraindication 
or precaution to Tdap (417). The tip and rubber plunger of the 
BOOSTRIX® needleless syringe contain latex. 
The BOOSTRIX® single dose vial and 
ADACEL® preparations contain no latex. Certain Td products contain latex. The 
package inserts should be consulted for details (Table 1).
 3. Special Situations
 3-A. Deferring Td during Pregnancy to Substitute 
Tdap in the Immediate Postpartum Period  Tetanus and diphtheria booster vaccination
is recommended for pregnant women if 
>10 years have elapsed since the previous Td vaccination 
(1,2).  To  add  protection  against  pertussis,  health-care  providers  may  defer  the  Td
vaccination 
during  pregnancy  to  substitute  Tdap  as  soon  as  feasible  postpartum  if  the  woman  is
likely to have sufficient tetanus and 
diphtheria protection until delivery.  Sufficient tetanus protection is likely if:
  A woman should receive Td during pregnancy if she
  Alternatively,  health-care  providers  may  choose  to  administer  Tdap  instead  of  Td
during pregnancy (see Considerations 
for Use of Tdap in Pregnant Women in Special Situations).  3-B. Postpartum Tdap When
<2 Years Have Elapsed Since the Most Recent Td
 Certain postpartum women (e.g., those who have received Td or TT within 2 years of
the immediate postpartum 
period)  might  benefit  from  Tdap  for  pertussis  protection.  Few  subjects  have  been
evaluated to determine the risk for adverse local 
and systemic reactions after Tdap at intervals <2 years since the most recent Td (or
other tetanus toxoid-- or diphtheria 
toxoid--containing  vaccine)  (215).  After  obtaining  a  history  to  exclude  women  with
moderate or severe adverse reactions 
following  previous  doses,  health-care  providers  may  choose  to  administer  Tdap  in
postpartum women who 
received tetanus toxoid-- or diphtheria toxoid--containing 
vaccine§§ <2 years previously (see Precautions and Reasons to Defer Td and Tdap).
 Health-care  providers  should  encourage  vaccination  of  household  and  child  care
provider contacts of infants aged 
<12  months  for  protection  against  pertussis,  according  to  current  recommendations
(Table 2) 
(1,2). Women should be advised of the symptoms of pertussis and the effectiveness of
early antimicrobial prophylaxis for themselves, their infant, and members 
of their household, if pertussis is suspected 
(127).
 3-C.  History  of  Pertussis   Postpartum  women  who  have  a  history  of  pertussis  should
receive Tdap according to the routine recommendation 
(see Recommendations for Use of Postpartum Tdap). This practice is preferred because
the duration of protection induced 
by pertussis is unknown (waning might begin as early as 5--10 years after infection) 
(4), and a diagnosis of pertussis often is 
not  reliably  confirmed.  Administering  pertussis  vaccine  to  persons  with  a  history  of
pertussis presents no theoretical 
safety concern.  3-D. Considerations for Use of Tdap in Pregnant 
Women  in  Special  Situations   ACIP  recommends  administration  of  Td  for  booster
protection against tetanus and diphtheria in pregnant 
women. However, health-care providers may choose to administer Tdap instead of Td
during pregnancy to add protection 
against pertussis in special situations. In these situations, the pregnant woman should
be informed of the lack of data confirming 
the safety and immunogenicity of Tdap in pregnant women, the unknown potential for
early protection of the infant 
against pertussis by transplacental maternal antibodies, and the possible adverse effect
of maternal antibodies on the ability of 
the  infant  to  mount  an  adequate  immune  response  to  antigens  in  pediatric  DTaP  or
conjugate vaccines containing tetanus 
toxoid or diphtheria toxoid.  Special situations in which Tdap might be used might 
include  instances  when    Persons  at  increased  risk  for  pertussis  might  include
adolescents aged 11--18 years, health-care personnel, and 
women employed in institutions in which a pertussis outbreak is 
occurring or living in a community in which a pertussis outbreak 
is occurring.  Adverse pregnancy outcomes are most common in the first trimester 
(418). To minimize the perception of an association 
of  vaccine  with  an  adverse  outcome,  vaccinating  with  tetanus  toxoid--containing
vaccines during the second or third trimester 
is  preferred.   Because  information  on  the  use  of  Tdap  in  pregnant  women  is  lacking,
both manufacturers of Tdap have established 
a pregnancy registry. Health-care providers are encouraged to 
report vaccination of pregnant women with Tdap, regardless 
of trimester, to the appropriate manufacturer's registry. For 
ADACEL,® vaccination should be reported to sanofi 
pasteur, telephone 1-800-822-2463 (1-800-VACCINE), and for 
BOOSTRIX,® vaccination should be reported to 
GlaxoSmithKline  Biologicals,  telephone  1-888-825-5249.   3-E.  Tetanus  Prophylaxis  for
Wound Management  ACIP has recommended administering tetanus 
toxoid--containing vaccine and tetanus immune globulin (TIG) as part 
of standard wound management to prevent tetanus 
(Table 11) (357). A Td booster might be recommended for 
wound  management  in  pregnant  women  if  5  years  or  more  have  elapsed  since  the
previous Td 
(1,2). Health-care providers may choose to substitute Tdap for Td during pregnancy in
these women (see Considerations for Use of Tdap in Pregnant 
Women in Special Situations). For pregnant women vaccinated previously with Tdap, Td
should be used if a tetanus 
toxoid--containing  vaccine  is  indicated  for  wound  care.  Pregnant  women  who  have
completed the 3-dose primary tetanus 
vaccination  series  and  have  received  a  tetanus  toxoid--containing  vaccine  within  the
preceding 5 years are protected against tetanus and 
do not require a tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine as part of wound management.
 To  avoid  unnecessary  vaccination,  health-care  providers  should  attempt  to
determine whether the woman has completed 
the  3-dose  primary  tetanus  vaccination  series.  Pregnant  women  with  unknown  or
uncertain previous tetanus vaccination 
histories should be considered to have had no prior tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine
and they should complete a 3-dose 
primary series of immunization to prevent maternal and neonatal tetanus (see Pregnant
Women with Unknown or Incomplete 
Tetanus  Vaccination).  Pregnant  women  who  have  not  completed  the  primary  series
might require tetanus toxoid and 
passive vaccination with TIG at the time of wound management (Table 11). When both
TIG and a tetanus 
toxoid--containing vaccine are indicated, each product should be administered using a
separate syringe at different anatomic sites. 
Pregnant  women  with  a  history  of  Arthus  reaction  after  a  previous  dose  of  a  tetanus
toxoid--containing vaccine should not receive 
a tetanus toxoid--containing vaccine until 10 years or more after the most recent dose,
even if they have a wound that is 
neither  clean  nor  minor.  If  the  Arthus  reaction  was  associated  with  a  vaccine  that
contained diphtheria toxoid without tetanus 
toxoid  (e.g.,  MCV4),  deferring  Td  or  Tdap  might  leave  the  pregnant  women
inadequately protected against tetanus, and TT 
should  be  administered  (see  Precautions  and  Reasons  to  Defer  Td  or  Tdap).  In  all
circumstances, the decision to administer TIG 
is  based  on  the  primary  vaccination  history  for  tetanus  (Table  11).   3-F.  Pregnant
Women with Unknown or Incomplete 
Tetanus Vaccination  Pregnant women who never have been vaccinated against tetanus
(i.e., have received no dose of pediatric DTP, DTaP, or 
DT or of adult Td or TT) should receive a series of three vaccinations containing tetanus
and diphtheria toxoids starting 
during  pregnancy  to  ensure  protection  against  maternal  and  neonatal  tetanus.  A
primary series consists of a first dose administered 
as soon as feasible, a second dose at least 4 weeks later, and a third dose 6 calendar
months after the second dose. If 
feasible,  pregnant  women  who  have  received  fewer  than  3  doses  of  tetanus
toxoid--containing vaccine should complete the 
3-dose  primary  series  during  pregnancy.  Td  is  preferred  for  the  doses  during
pregnancy. Health-care providers may choose 
to substitute a single dose of Tdap for 1 dose of Td during pregnancy and complete the
series with Td. In such cases, the 
women  should  be  informed  of  the  lack  of  data  on  safety,  immunogenicity,  and
pregnancy outcomes for pregnant women who 
receive  Tdap  (see  Considerations  for  Use  of  Tdap  in  Pregnant  Women  in  Special
Situations).
 Reporting  Adverse  Events  after  Vaccination   As  with  any  newly  licensed  vaccine,
surveillance for rare adverse events associated with administration of Tdap 
is important for assessing its safety in large-scale use. The 
National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 requires 
health-care providers to report specific adverse events that follow tetanus, diphtheria,
or pertussis vaccination. A table of reportable 
events following vaccination is available from VAERS at
http://vaers.hhs.gov/reportable.htm. All clinically significant adverse 
events should be reported to VAERS even if causal relation to vaccination is not certain.
VAERS reporting forms and information 
are
 available
 electronically
 at
 http://www.vaers.hhs.gov
 or
 by
 telephone,
1-800-822-7967. 
To promote better timeliness and quality of safety data, providers are encouraged to
report electronically by using web-based reporting

 Vaccine
 Injury
 Compensation
Program  VICP is a system established by the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of
1986 that enables compensation to be 
paid on behalf of a person thought to have been injured or died as a result of receiving
a vaccine covered by the program. 
Anyone receiving a covered vaccine, regardless of age, can file a petition under VICP.
The program is intended as an alternative to 
civil litigation under the traditional tort system because negligence need not be proven.
 The Act establishes 1) a vaccine injury table that lists the vaccines covered by the
program; 2) the injuries, disabilities, 
and conditions (including death) for which compensation might be paid without proof of
causation; and 3) the period 
after vaccination during which the first symptom or substantial aggravation of the injury
must appear. Persons might 
be  compensated  for  an  injury  listed  in  the  table  or  one  that  can  be  demonstrated  to
result from administration of a listed 
vaccine.  All  tetanus  toxoid--containing  vaccines  and  vaccines  with  pertussis
components (e.g., Tdap, Td, and pediatric DTaP) 
are covered under the Act. Additional information regarding the program is available at 
http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccine  compensation  or  by  telephone,  1-800-338-2382.  
Interest in vaccinating pregnant women to prevent infant pertussis declined in the late
1940s when whole-cell vaccine 
trials  demonstrated  pertussis-specific  antibodies  in  as  many  as  75%  of  infants
vaccinated starting at birth or in the first few 
months of life (38,186,188,218,237) and infant and childhood vaccination was adopted
as the primary national strategy 
for protection against childhood diseases 
(419,420). Aside from initiatives to eliminate neonatal tetanus and more recently 
to  prevent  influenza  during  pregnancy,  limited  attention  has  been  focused  on
vaccinating pregnant women as a strategy 
to prevent disease in the women and their infants during the first few months of life 
(290,421--430). A major barrier to conducting vaccine trials in pregnant women is the
potential liability from expected adverse pregnancy outcomes that 
might be related temporally to vaccination 
(388,431,432). However, the high morbidity and mortality of certain infections 
that  affect  pregnant  women  and  neonates  warrant  renewed  consideration  of  the
strategy of vaccinating pregnant women.
 Ensuring the safety of vaccination for mother and fetus and for pregnancy outcomes
is a public health priority. In 
addition,  important  considerations  include  understanding  whether  a  degree  of
protection might be achieved for the mother and for 
her newborn by vaccinating during pregnancy, whether maternal vaccination would be
required with each pregnancy to 
achieve  these  benefits  (if  any),  and  whether  change  in  the  levels  of  transplacental
maternal antibody might affect infant responses 
to  routine  vaccination  (159,222,224,228).  Because  few  vaccines  are  currently
recommended for pregnant women (e.g., Td 
and influenza), the effects of the transplacental maternal 
antibodies on the subsequent infant responses to routine vaccination 
with  the  same  antigens  are  not  known  for  most  vaccines.  Change  in  the  levels  of
transplacental antibody can affect 
infant susceptibility to disease at a population level. For example, a decrease over time
in the level of transplacental maternal 
antibody  from  women  who  were  immunized  with  measles  vaccine  during  childhood
(rather than by measles disease) resulted 
in susceptibility to measles among their infants at an earlier age, and to the decision to
recommend infant measles vaccination 
at age 12 months rather than age 15--18 months in the United States 
(228,433,434).
 Major gaps exist in the knowledge of how best to prevent pertussis in early infancy.
These include 1) the safety of 
pertussis vaccines for pregnant women, their fetuses, and pregnancy outcomes; 2) the
immunogenicity of acellular pertussis vaccines 
in 
pregnant women and transplacental maternal antibodies with respect to the timing of
immunization during pregnancy; 3) 
the  degree  and  duration  of  protection  against  pertussis  in  early  infancy  through
transplacental maternal antibodies; and 4) 
the  effects  of  transplacental  maternal  antibodies  (induced  by  pertussis,  DTP,  DTaP,
and/or Tdap) on the infant responses to 
active  immunization  with  pediatric  DTaP  and  conjugate  vaccines  containing  tetanus
toxoid or diphtheria 
toxoid  (159,222,234,235,435).  To  understand  the  range  of  options  for  protecting
women and infants from pertussis, studies 
are  needed  to  determine  the  safety  and  any  benefits  of  accelerated  infant  pertussis
vaccination schedules or dosing (e.g., 
pertussis  vaccination  starting  at  birth  or  employing  acellular  vaccines  that  do  not
contain diphtheria toxoid and tetanus 
toxoid)
 (221,436,437).
 Alternative
 infant
 vaccination
 strategies
 examined
independently or in conjunction with vaccinating 
pregnant women will determine the most effective and practical approaches to reduce
the morbidity and mortality of pertussis.

    * The recommended childhood schedule of pediatric DTaP is a dose at ages 6--8
weeks, at 4 months, and at 6 months and a booster dose at age 15--18 
months and at age 4--6 years (23).
 † A list of members appears on inside back cover of this report.
 § Titers of >1:320 have been reported to correlate with protection in some studies 
(218).
 ¶  An  interval  of  5  years  since  the  most  recent  tetanus  and  diphtheria
toxoids--containing vaccine is encouraged for routine vaccination of adolescents who 
are not pregnant (2).
 ** Women who have had a 3-dose series as TT instead of Td will likely have protection
against tetanus but might not be protected against diphtheria. 
A protective titer of diphtheria antitoxin is >0.1 IU/mL by ELISA.  †† A list of areas in
which diphtheria is endemic is available at www.cdc.gov/travel/diseases/dtp.htm.
 §§  Tetanus  toxoid--  and/or  diphtheria  toxoid--containing  vaccines  include  pediatric
DTP, DTaP, DT, other pediatric combination vaccines including 
any  of  these  components  (e.g.,  pediatric  DTaP--inactivated  poliovirus  vaccine--Hep  B
and pediatric 
DTaP--Haemophilus influenzae type b), and adult 
and  adolescent  Td,  Tdap,  and  TT).  MCV4  contains  diphtheria  toxoid  but  not  tetanus
toxoid 
(2).
