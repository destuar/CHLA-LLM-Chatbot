scabies  are  intense  itching  (pruritus),  especially  at  night,  and  a  pimple-like  (papular)
itchy  rash.   These  symptoms  are  caused  by  your  body's  reaction  to  the  mite  and  its
eggs and feces (i.e, an allergy). Common areas on body where rashes occur include 
Infants and very young children often experience a rash on the head, face, neck, palms,
and soles of the feet. Female scabies mites can also cause tiny burrows just beneath
the surface of the skin. These burrows look like tiny raised, crooked (serpiginous) lines
on  the  skin  surface.  They  can  be  grayish-white  or  skin  colored.  The  burrows  may  be
difficult to find because there may only be 10 – 15 mites present.  3 – 6 weeks If you
have  never  had  scabies,  symptoms  can  take  up  to  three  to  six  weeks  to  appear.
However, you can still spread scabies even if you do not have symptoms. 1 – 4 days If
you  have  had  scabies  before,  symptoms  typically  appear  one  to  four  days  after
exposure. If you suspect you have scabies or complications from scabies, contact your
healthcare provider. Repeated scratching of an area can cause skin sores. These sores
can  become  infected  with  bacteria  on  the  skin,  such  as  Staphylococcus  aureus  or
beta-hemolytic streptococci, and may need antibiotics. In severe cases, bacterial skin
infections  can  lead  to  inflammation  or  damage  of  the  kidneys.  This  is  called
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.  Scabies is an infestation of the skin by a human
itch mite. Languages Language Assistance Languages  Language Assistance
