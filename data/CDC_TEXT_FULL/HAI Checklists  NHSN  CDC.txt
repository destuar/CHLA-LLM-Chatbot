were  developed  by  the  National  Healthcare  Network  (NHSN)  subject  matter  experts
(SMEs)  as  a  tool  to  aid  Infection  Preventionists  and  other  users  when  making  a
determination about a healthcare-associated infection. The HAI checklists should not be
used  in  isolation,  but  in  conjunction  with  the  Patient  Safety  Manual.  Please  note  all
