Trusted Source page. This resource provides information ranging from basic respirator
facts  to  more  complex  subjects  on  respirator  function  and  performance.  The  NIOSH
National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) is the home of the NIOSH
Respirator  Approval  Program.  NPPTL  is  responsible  for  testing  and  approving  all
respirators  used  in  U.S.  occupational  settings.  The  NIOSH  approval  process  ensures
respirators  meet  minimum  construction,  performance,  and  respiratory  protection
standards.  Therefore,  users  can  be  confident  that  NIOSH-approved  respirators  will
provide the expected level of protection. Millions of workers across the United States
rely  on  respiratory  protection  to  keep  them  safe  on  the  job.  This  includes  workers  in
occupations such as healthcare, construction, public safety, emergency response, and
mining. To reduce exposure to respiratory hazards, it’s best to apply the hierarchy of
controls. The use of respiratory protection is an important “last line of defense” in the
hierarchy  of  controls  approach.  Below  are  links  to  resources  that  will  help  you  find
NIOSH-approved respirators and understand how to use them effectively.
