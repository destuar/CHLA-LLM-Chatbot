about  this  topic?  SARS-CoV-2  hybrid  immunity  (immunity  derived  from  both  previous
infection and vaccination) has been reported to provide better protection than that from
infection  or  vaccination  alone.  What  is  added  by  this  report?  By  the  third  quarter  of
2022,  an  estimated  96.4%  of  persons  aged  ≥16  years  in  a  longitudinal  blood  donor
cohort  had  SARS-CoV-2  antibodies  from  previous  infection  or  vaccination,  including
22.6%  from  infection  alone  and  26.1%  from  vaccination  alone;  47.7%  had  hybrid
immunity. Hybrid immunity prevalence was lowest among adults aged ≥65 years. What
are the implications for public health practice? Low prevalence of infection-induced and
hybrid  immunity  among  older  adults,  who  are  at  increased  risk  for  severe  disease  if
infected,  reflects  the  success  of  public  health  infection  prevention  efforts  while  also
highlighting  the  importance  of  this  group  staying  up  to  date  with  recommended
COVID-19 vaccination, including at least 1 bivalent dose. Views equals page views plus

requirements have hampered the ability to estimate the U.S. SARS-CoV-2 incidence (1).
Hybrid immunity (immunity derived from both previous infection and vaccination) has
been reported to provide better protection than that from infection or vaccination alone
(2).  To  estimate  the  incidence  of  infection  and  the  prevalence  of  infection-  or
vaccination-induced antibodies (or both), data from a nationwide, longitudinal cohort of
blood  donors  were  analyzed.  During  the  second  quarter  of  2021  (April–June),  an
estimated  68.4%  of  persons  aged  ≥16  years  had  infection-  or  vaccination-induced
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including 47.5% from vaccination alone, 12.0% from infection
alone, and 8.9% from both. By the third quarter of 2022 (July–September), 96.4% had
SARS-CoV-2  antibodies  from  previous  infection  or  vaccination,  including  22.6%  from
infection  alone  and  26.1%  from  vaccination  alone;  47.7%  had  hybrid  immunity.
Prevalence of hybrid immunity was lowest among persons aged ≥65 years (36.9%), the
group with the highest risk for severe disease if infected, and was highest among those
aged  16–29  years  (59.6%).  Low  prevalence  of  infection-induced  and  hybrid  immunity
among  older  adults  reflects  the  success  of  public  health  infection  prevention  efforts
while  also  highlighting  the  importance  of  older  adults  staying  up  to  date  with
recommended  COVID-19  vaccination,  including  at  least  1  bivalent  dose.*,†  Since  July
2020, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the United States has been estimated by testing
blood donations (3). CDC, in collaboration with Vitalant, American Red Cross, Creative
Testing Solutions, and Westat, established a nationwide cohort of 142,758 blood donors
in July 2021; the cohort included persons who had donated blood two or more times in
the preceding year.§ All blood donations collected during April–June 2021 were tested
for antibodies against the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Beginning in 2022,
up to one blood donation sample per donor was randomly selected each quarter and
tested using the Ortho VITROS SARS-CoV-2 Quantitative S immunoglobulin G¶ and total
N  antibody**  tests.  Both  SARS-CoV-2  infection  and  COVID-19  vaccination  result  in
production of anti-S antibodies, whereas anti-N antibodies only result from infection. At
each donation, blood donors were asked if they had received a COVID-19 vaccine. Using
vaccination  history  and  results  of  antibody  testing,  the  prevalence  of  the  U.S.
population aged ≥16 years with vaccine-induced, infection-induced, or hybrid immunity
was  estimated  for  four  3-month  periods  (April–June  2021,  January–March  2022,
April–June 2022, and July–September 2022); in addition, the proportion of persons who
transitioned  from  one  immune  status  to  another  by  quarter  was  estimated.  Analysis
was  limited  to  72,748  (51.0%)  donors  for  whom  it  was  possible  to  ascertain  immune
status  during  each  period  using  their  prior  classification  (e.g.,  previously  infected  or
vaccinated), antibody testing results, and their vaccination status at the time of each
donation.††  The  sample  data  were  weighted  to  account  for  selection  into  the  study
cohort,  for  nonresponse  during  the  four  analysis  periods,  and  for  demographic
differences  between  the  blood  donor  population  and  the  overall  U.S.  population.  The
weights were obtained through a combination of stratification and raking, an iterative
weighting  adjustment  procedure  (4).  Rates  of  infection  among  those  previously
uninfected  were  estimated  for  each  period  by  determining  the  percentage  of
anti-N–negative  persons  seroconverting  to  anti-N–positive  from  one  3-month  period
included in the study to the next. Estimates were stratified by age group (16–29, 30–49,
50–64,  and  ≥65  years)  and  race  and  ethnicity§§  (Asian,  Black  or  African  American
[Black], White, Hispanic or Latino [Hispanic], and other). SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute)
was used to compute the final weights, and R (version 4.2.1; R Foundation) was used to
calculate all the estimates and create the plots.¶¶ Seroprevalence and infection rates
were  estimated  as  weighted  means  and  compared  by  demographic  group  and
vaccination  status  using  two-sided  t-tests  with  a  significance  level  of  α  =  0.05.  This
activity was reviewed by CDC and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and
CDC policy.*** During the first quarter examined (April–June 2021), an estimated 68.4%
(95% CI = 67.8%–68.9%) of persons aged ≥16 years had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from
previous  infection  or  vaccination,  including  47.5%  (95%  CI  =  46.0%–49.0%)  from
vaccination alone, 12.0% (95% CI = 10.8%–13.5%) from infection alone, and 8.9% (95%
CI
 =
 8.7%–9.2%)
 from
 both
 (Figure

CI = 93.1%–93.9%) of persons aged ≥16 years had antibodies from previous infection
or vaccination, including 39.0% (95% CI = 37.4%–40.7%) from vaccination alone, 20.5%
(95%  CI  =  19.2%–22.2%)  from  infection  alone,  and  34.1%  (95%  CI  =  32.4%–35.8%)
from  both.  During  July–September  2022,  96.4%  (95%  CI  =  96.1%–96.7%)  of  persons
had  antibodies  from  previous  infection  or  vaccination,  including  26.1%  (95%
CI

 25.4%–26.9%)
 with
 vaccine-induced
 immunity
 alone,
 22.6%
 (95%
CI  =  21.2%–24.1%)  with  infection-induced  immunity  alone,  and  47.7%  (95%
CI = 44.8%–51.2%) with hybrid immunity. During July–September 2022, the prevalence
of  infection-induced  immunity  was  85.7%  (95%  CI  =  79.8%–90.2%)  among
unvaccinated persons and 64.3% (95% CI = 61.9%–66.7%) among vaccinated persons.
During  July–September  2022,  the  lowest  prevalence  of  hybrid  immunity,  36.9%  (95%
CI = 35.8%–38.1%), was observed in persons aged ≥65 years, and the highest, 59.6%
(95% CI = 56.7%–62.3%), in adolescents and young adults aged 16–29 years (Figure 2)
(Supplementary  Figure  2,  https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128679).  During  all  periods,
higher  prevalences  of  hybrid  immunity  were  observed  among  Black  and  Hispanic
populations  than  among  White  and  Asian  populations  (Supplementary  Figure  3,
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/128680). Among persons with no previous infection, the
incidence  of  first  infections  during  the  study  period  (i.e.,  conversion  from
anti-N–negative  to  anti-N–positive)  was  higher  among  unvaccinated  persons  (Table).
From  April–June  2021  through  January–March  2022,  the  incidence  of  first  SARS-CoV-2
infections  among  unvaccinated  persons  was  67.0%,  compared  with  26.3%  among
vaccinated  persons  (p<0.05).  From  January–March  2022  through  April–June  2022,  the
incidence among unvaccinated persons was 21.7% and was 13.3% among vaccinated
persons.  Between  April–June  2022  and  July–September  2022,  the  incidence  among
unvaccinated  persons  was  28.3%,  compared  with  22.9%  among  vaccinated  persons
(p<0.05).  Incidence  of  first  SARS-CoV-2  infections  was  higher  among  younger  than
among older persons and was lower among Asian persons than among other racial and
ethnic  populations,  but  the  differences  among  groups  narrowed  over  time.  Top  Both
infection-induced and hybrid immunity increased during the study period. By the third
quarter of 2022, approximately two thirds of persons aged ≥16 years had been infected
with  SARS-CoV-2  and  one  half  of  all  persons  had  hybrid  immunity.  Compared  with
vaccine
 effectiveness
 against
 any
 infection
 and
 against
 severe
 disease
 or
hospitalization, the effectiveness of hybrid immunity against these outcomes has been
shown  to  be  higher  and  wane  more  slowly  (2).  This  increase  in  seroprevalence,
including  hybrid  immunity,  is  likely  contributing  to  lower  rates  of  severe  disease  and
death from COVID-19 in 2022–2023 than during the early pandemic.††† The prevalence
of hybrid immunity is lowest in adults aged ≥65 years, likely due to higher vaccination
coverage and earlier availability of COVID-19 vaccines for this age group, as well as to
higher  prevalences  of  behavioral  practices  to  avoid  infection  (5).  However,  lower
prevalences of infection-induced and hybrid immunity could further increase the risk for
severe disease in this group, highlighting the importance for adults aged ≥65 years to
stay  up  to  date  with  COVID-19  vaccination  and  have  easy  access  to  antiviral
medications.  COVID-19  vaccine  efficacy  studies  have  reported  reduced  effectiveness
against  SARS-CoV-2  infection  during  the  Omicron-predominant  period  compared  with
earlier  periods  and  have  shown  that  protection  against  infection  wanes  more  rapidly
than does protection against severe disease (6,7). In this study, unvaccinated persons
had  higher  rates  of  infection  (as  evidenced  by  N  antibody  seroconversion)  than  did
vaccinated  persons,  indicating  that  vaccination  provides  some  protection  against
infection.  The  differences  in  incidence  could  also  be  due  to  systematic  differences
between vaccinated and unvaccinated persons in terms of the prevalence of practicing
prevention behaviors such as masking and physical distancing. The relative difference
in infection rates narrowed during the most recent months, possibly because of waning
of  vaccine-induced  protection  against  infection  in  the  setting  of  increased  time  after
vaccination or immune evasion by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. The narrowing of
difference  in  infection  rates  might  also  be  attributable  to  increasing  similarities  in
behavior  among  vaccinated  and  unvaccinated  persons  during  late  2022  (8).  The
findings  in  this  report  are  subject  to  at  least  six  limitations.  First,  although  COVID-19
booster  vaccine  doses  and  reinfections  can  strengthen  immunity  (9,10),  this  analysis
did  not  account  for  these  effects  because  blood  donor  vaccination  history  did  not
include  the  number  of  doses  received,  and  data  on  reinfections  were  not  captured.
Second,  immunity  wanes  over  time,  but  time  since  vaccination  or  infection  was  not
included  in  the  analysis  (2).  Third,  vaccination  status  was  self-reported,  potentially
leading  to  misclassification.  Fourth,  although  the  results  were  adjusted  based  on
differences in blood donor and general population demographics, estimates from blood
donors might not be representative of the general population; thus, these results might
not be generalizable. Fifth, vaccinated and unvaccinated persons might differ in other
ways not captured by this analysis (8), nor can causality be inferred from the results on
relative infection incidence. Finally, if both vaccination and infection occurred between
blood donations included in the study, the order of occurrence could not be determined,
and some unvaccinated donors might have been vaccinated before infection and thus
misclassified; in 2022, this was uncommon and occurred in <0.5% of donors during any
3-month period. This report found that the incidence of first-time SARS-CoV-2 infection
was  lower  among  persons  who  had  received  COVID-19  vaccine  than  among
unvaccinated persons and that infection-induced and hybrid immunity have increased
but  remain  lowest  in  adults  aged  ≥65  years.  These  adults  have  consistently  had  a
higher  risk  for  severe  disease  compared  with  younger  age  groups,  underscoring  the
importance of older adults staying up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccination,
including  at  least  1  bivalent  dose.  Top  Brad  Biggerstaff,  Matthew  McCullough,  CDC;
