During  March  29–April  25,  2020,  U.S.  emergency  department  (ED)  visits  declined  by
42%  after  the  declaration  of  a  national  emergency  for  COVID-19  on  March  13,  2020.
The number of ED visits increased by July 2020 but remain below prepandemic levels.
What is added by this report? ED visits during December 2020–January 2021 were 25%
lower than during the same months the year before. Higher proportions of ED patients
are seeking care for mental and behavioral health–related concerns, especially pediatric
patients. What are the implications for public health practice? Efforts to ensure public
understanding  of  the  importance  of  seeking  guidance  and  emergency  care  for  acute
and  mental  or  behavioral  health  conditions  are  necessary.  Views  equals  page  views

department (ED) visits in the United States declined by 42% after the declaration of a
national emergency for COVID-19 on March 13, 2020. Among children aged ≤10 years,
ED  visits  declined  by  72%  compared  with  prepandemic  levels  (1).  To  assess  the
continued  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  EDs,  CDC  examined  trends  in  visits
since December 30, 2018, and compared the numbers and types of ED visits by patient
demographic  and  geographic  factors  during  a  COVID-19  pandemic  period  (December
20,  2020–January  16,  2021)  with  a  prepandemic  period  1  year  earlier  (December  15,
2019–January 11, 2020). After an initial decline during March–April 2020 (1), ED visits
increased through July 2020, but at levels below those during the previous year, until
December  2020–January  2021  when  visits  again  fell  to  25%  of  prepandemic  levels.
During this time, among patients aged 0–4, 5–11, 12–17, and ≥18 years, ED visits were
lower by 66%, 63%, 38%, and 17%, respectively, compared with ED visits for each age
group during the same period before the pandemic. Differences were also observed by
region  and  reasons  for  ED  visits  during  December  2020–January  2021;  more  visits
during this period were for infectious diseases or mental and behavioral health–related
concerns  and  fewer  visits  were  for  gastrointestinal  and  upper-respiratory–related
illnesses  compared  with  ED  visits  during  December  2019–January  2020.  Although  the
numbers of ED visits associated with socioeconomic factors and mental or behavioral
health  conditions  are  low,  the  increased  visits  by  both  adults  and  children  for  these
concerns  suggest  that  health  care  providers  should  maintain  heightened  vigilance  in
screening  for  factors  that  might  warrant  further  treatment,  guidance,  or  intervention
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Data  were  obtained  from  the  National  Syndromic
Surveillance  Program  (NSSP),*  a  collaborative  system  developed  and  maintained  by
CDC,  state  and  local  health  departments,  and  academic  and  private  sector  health
partners. NSSP collects electronic health data in near real-time, including ED visits from
a  subset  of  hospitals  in  49  states  (all  but  Hawaii)  and  the  District  of  Columbia.  This
study analyzed information collected from approximately 71% of nonfederal facilities,
nationwide, using data for all ED visits from participating hospitals in the 46 states that
reported  ED  visits  consistently  during  the  prepandemic  (December  15,  2019–January
11, 2020) and pandemic (December 20, 2020–January 16, 2021) periods assessed. All
hospitals  in  Hawaii,  Ohio,  South  Dakota,  and  Wyoming,  and  hospitals  in  other  states
that started or stopped reporting during 2019–2021 were excluded. Patient diagnoses
were  analyzed  using  a  subset  of  records  that  included  at  least  one  specific,  billable

(ICD-10-CM)  code.  Facilities  that  did  not  report  diagnostic  codes  consistently  or
reported  incomplete  codes  during  2019–2021  were  excluded.  ED  visits  were
categorized using the Clinical Classifications Software Refined tool from the Healthcare
Cost and Utilization Project, which combines ICD-10-CM codes into clinically meaningful
groups (2). This analysis was limited to the top 200 diagnostic categories (pediatric =
455  total  diagnostic  categories;  adult  =  497  total  diagnostic  categories)  for  each
patient-level  category  evaluated  during  the  assessed  periods.  The  10  categories  with
the  highest  and  lowest  significant  (p<0.05)  prevalence  ratios  (PRs)†  were  identified.
Trends in ED visits during December 30, 2018–January 16, 2021 were examined; overall
analysis  of  trends  focused  on  the  prepandemic  period  during  December  15,
2019–January  11,  2020  and  the  pandemic  period  during  December  20,  2020–January
16, 2021, with comparisons by patient sex, age, U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) region,§ and reason for the visit. Estimates of weekly change¶ and PRs
were calculated to assess differences in numbers of ED visits between the two periods.
All  analyses  were  conducted  using  R  software  (version  4.0.;  The  R  Foundation)  This
activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law
and CDC policy.** After decreasing by 42% during March–April 2020 (1), overall U.S. ED
visits increased through July 2020 then stabilized in August 2020 at levels 15% below
those  during  the  same  prepandemic  period.  During  December  2020–January  2021,
numbers of visits declined again to a level 25% lower than those during the previous
year (December 2019–January 2020) (Figure), including a 23% decline in visits by males
and  a  27%  decline  in  visits  by  females.  During  December  2020–January  2021,  the
numbers  of  ED  visits  in  all  age  groups  were  lower  than  were  those  during  the
prepandemic  period.  The  largest  observed  decline  in  visits  was  among  children,
especially those aged 0–4 years (66%) and 5–11 years (63%) (Supplementary Figure 1,
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/104808). ED visits by adults aged ≥18 years were 17%
lower  than  ED  visits  during  the  prepandemic  period  (Figure).  During  December
2020–January  2021,  ED  visits  varied  by  HHS  region,  ranging  from  an  overall  29%
decrease in the upper Midwest to a 21% decrease in the Northeast. ED visits by adults
and
 pediatric
 patients
 declined
 in
 all
 regions
 (Supplementary
 Figure
 2,
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/104808),  ranging  from  a  23%  decrease  in  the  West
(Region 9) to a 14% decrease in the Northeast (Region 3) among adults, and from 65%
in the Northeast (Region 2) to 53% in the Midwest (Region 7) among children. During
December 2020–January 2021, the proportion of ED visits for infectious disease–related
concerns (i.e., exposure, encounters, screening, or contact with infectious disease) was
higher than that during the same period before the pandemic for adults (PR = 5.86) and
children  (PR  =  9.22),  as  were  the  proportion  of  visits  related  to  socioeconomic  and
psychosocial (mental and behavioral health–related concerns) factors (adults PR = 1.37;
children PR = 2.56). Among adults, the proportion of ED visits during this period was
also  higher  than  that  during  the  prepandemic  period  for  menopausal  disorders
(PR = 1.89); respiratory failure, insufficiency, and arrest (PR = 1.62); acute pulmonary
embolism  (PR  =  1.59);  cardiac  arrest  and  ventricular  fibrillation  (PR  =  1.45);  malaise
and fatigue (PR = 1.34); acute and unspecified renal failure (PR = 1.33); and symptoms
of  mental  and  substance-use  conditions  (PR  =  1.28)  (Table  1).  Among  children,  the
proportion of ED visits during this period was higher compared with the prepandemic
period for calculus of the urinary tract (PR = 2.70); open wounds to limbs, subsequent
encounter (PR = 2.67); suicidal ideation, attempt, and intentional self-harm (PR = 2.64);
sexually  transmitted  infections  (HIV  and  viral  hepatitis)  (PR  =  2.57);  schizophrenia
spectrum  and  other  psychotic  disorders  (PR  =  2.55);  lifestyle  and  life  management
factors  (e.g.,  tobacco  use,  lack  of  physical  exercise,  high-risk  sexual  behavior,  sleep
deprivation or insomnia, or stress or burnout) (PR = 2.55); feeding and eating disorders
(PR = 2.52); and open wounds of the head and neck, subsequent encounter (PR = 2.51)
(Table 2). Decreases in the proportion of ED visits related to gastrointestinal and upper
respiratory–related factors were identified in both adults and children, with the largest
declines  among  children  for  influenza  (PR  =  0.01),  acute  bronchitis  (PR  =  0.17),
pneumonia  except  that  caused  by  tuberculosis  (PR  =  0.30),  otitis  media  (0.36),  and
sinusitis  (PR  =  0.42).  Top  After  a  decline  in  ED  visits  in  the  United  States  associated
with the COVID-19 pandemic during March–April 2020 (1), ED visits steadily increased
through July 2020, and then stabilized through the fall. During December 2020–January
2021,  visits  declined  again  to  a  level  25%  lower  than  that  during  December
2019–January 2020. These declines were highest in children aged ≤10 years, who had
65%  fewer  ED  visits  during  December  2020–January  2021  than  during  December
2019–January  2020.  Although  ED  visits  increased  among  adults  during  December
2020–January 2021, they were 17% below those during the prepandemic period. There
was  a  decline  in  ED  visits  among  children  for  conditions  such  as  influenza,  acute
bronchitis,  and  pneumonia,  which  could  reflect  reduced  transmission  of  other
pathogens; therefore the decreased visits might represent appropriate use of ED care
or  that  children  might  be  disproportionately  affected  by  changes  in  care-seeking
behaviors because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reasons for ED visits have changed
during the pandemic period compared with those during the prepandemic period. More
visits were associated with severe respiratory and cardiovascular conditions during the
pandemic period; more adults and children have also been seeking emergency care for
mental  or  behavioral  health  and  socioeconomic  and  psychosocial  concerns.  However,
weekly numbers for visits for some categories of mental or behavioral health diagnoses
(e.g., feeding and eating disorders) remain relatively low, particularly among pediatric
patients.
 Decreases

 might
disproportionately  affect  families  that  lack  reliable  access  to  primary  care  and  might
instead  use  EDs  for  treatment  (3),  possibly  preventing  them  from  obtaining  needed
care.  In  addition,  the  wide  regional  variations  in  numbers  of  ED  visits  might  indicate
differences  in  public  health  messaging  and  risk  perceptions  regarding  COVID-19,
stay-at-home  policies,  transmission  patterns,  access  to  testing  and  primary  care,  as
well as other factors. Possible barriers to necessary medical care should be addressed
with targeted public health messaging and clinical guidance to ensure that treatment
for critical conditions is not delayed. Although the numbers of ED visits associated with
socioeconomic  factors  and  mental  or  behavioral  health  conditions  are  low,  the
increased  proportion  of  these  visits  by  both  adults  and  children  suggests  that  health
care providers should maintain heightened vigilance in screening for factors that might
warrant  further  treatment,  guidance,  or  intervention  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic
(4,5). The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, diagnostic
categories  rely  on  the  use  of  specific  codes,  which  might  be  missing  or  used
inconsistently  across  hospitals  (6).  Second,  NSSP  coverage  is  not  uniform  across  or
within  states;  some  hospitals  report  statewide  and  others  do  not  report  statewide  or
have  no  data  available  for  some  counties.  However,  given  that  NSSP  data  represent
71% of U.S. EDs, trends identified at the national level likely represent actual patterns
in  persons  seeking  care  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Third,  this  analysis  did  not
analyze NSSP data by age, sex, race, and ethnicity within each region; future studies
that  evaluate  this  information  can  help  guide  interventions  to  address  the  increased
prevalence  of  socioeconomic  factors  and  mental  or  behavioral  health  conditions
associated  with  ED  visits.  Finally,  ED  visits  and  trends  are  likely  the  result  of  many
factors that can be challenging to fully understand with limited patient data available;
additional studies are needed to help guide public health communication strategies on
ED use. These findings provide updates for clinical and public health stakeholders on
the  changing  profile  of  ED  visits  associated  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  CDC  is
available to provide support to sites interested in participating in NSSP to monitor for
critical trends in ED visits. As the nation continues to manage the impact of the ongoing
pandemic, public understanding of the importance of seeking guidance and emergency
care for acute and mental or behavioral health conditions is necessary. Wider access to
health  messages,  triage  help  lines,  and  virtual  visits  that  help  all  persons,  especially
caregivers  of  children  and  adolescents,  can  help  determine  when  seeking  immediate
care might be warranted and might also result in fewer patients seeking ED care (7).
