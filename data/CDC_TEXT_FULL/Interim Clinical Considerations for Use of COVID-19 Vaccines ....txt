recommendations  for  use  of  2024–2025  COVID-19  vaccines  in  people  ages  6  months
and older as approved or authorized by FDA. The 2024–2025 vaccines are expected to
be available in fall 2024. This page will be updated at that time to align with the new
recommendations.  Learn  more.  Expiration  dates  vary  by  manufacturer  and  vaccine.
Always check the expiration date or beyond-use date/time to ensure it has not passed.
Never use expired vaccine or diluent. See the Interim Clinical Considerations for Use of
COVID-19  Vaccines  in  the  United  States  for  information  on  interchangeability  of
COVID-19 vaccines. Everyone ages 6 months and older vaccinated outside the United
States  should  receive  at  least  1  dose  of  an  updated  (2023–2024  Formula)  COVID-19
vaccine regardless of past COVID-19 vaccination history (e.g., vaccine type[s], vaccine
manufacturer[s],  number  of  doses)  unless  they  received  an  updated  (2023–2024
Formula)  COVID-19  vaccine  that  is  FDA-approved  or  FDA-authorized  (i.e.,  Moderna,
Novavax,  Pfizer-BioNTech)  or  listed  for  emergency  use  by  the  World  Health
Organization (WHO). COVID-19 vaccines that are listed for emergency use by WHO, but
are not approved or authorized by FDA, have not been evaluated for efficacy or safety
by CDC or ACIP. Recommendations for people who were vaccinated outside the United
States, but have not received an updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine are
as  follows:  Special  situation:  If  unable  to  determine  if  a  previously  received  vaccine
dose was an updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine, do not count and follow
guidance for administering an updated (2023–2024 Formula) COVID-19 vaccine dose. A
vaccine  administration  error  is  any  preventable  event  that  might  cause  or  lead  to
inappropriate use of vaccine or to patient harm. The package insert or EUA fact sheet
for healthcare providers should be referenced for detailed information on storage and
handling,  dosing  and  schedule,  dose  preparation,  and  administration  of  COVID-19
vaccines.  The  information  provided  below  on  managing  vaccine  administration  errors
should not be interpreted as a recommendation or promotion of unauthorized use of the
vaccines.  For  all  vaccine  administration  errors:  COVID-19  vaccine  administration
errors—even  those  not  associated  with  an  adverse  event—should  be  reported  to  the
Vaccine  Adverse  Event  Reporting  System  (VAERS).  To  file  an  electronic  report,  see
the  VAERS  website.  Table  B.  Interim  recommendations  for  COVID-19  vaccine
administration errors and deviations *In addition to the minimum age, for children who
are not moderately or severely immunocompromised, some experts suggest delaying
the repeat dose for 8 weeks after the invalid dose based on the potential for increased
reactogenicity and the rare risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with mRNA
COVID-19  vaccines.  †If  the  administration  error  resulted  in  a  higher-than-authorized
vaccine  dose,  in  general  a  subsequent  dose  may  still  be  administered  at  the
recommended interval. However, if local or systemic side effects following vaccination
are clinically concerning (outside of the expected side effect profile) or are ongoing at
the time of the subsequent dose, this dose might be delayed, but this decision should
be  assessed  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  ‡FDA  authorization  allows  for  dosing  options  in
certain  situations  when  a  child  ages  from  a  younger  to  older  age  group;  see
Transitioning from a younger to older age group. If the dosing is in accordance with the
FDA EUA, it is not considered an error and VAERS reporting is not indicated. §For people
ages  6  months–64  years  who  are  not  moderately  or  severely  immunocompromised,
some experts suggest delaying the dose for 8 weeks after the dose given in error based
on  the  potential  for  increased  reactogenicity  and  the  rare  risk  of  myocarditis  and
pericarditis  observed  in  mRNA  (Moderna  or  Pfizer-BioNTech)  and  Novavax  COVID-19
vaccine recipients, particularly males ages 12–39 years. For additional information, see
Considerations for extended intervals for COVID-19 vaccine doses. ¶As of the date of
this update, current manufacturer contact information is: See the package inserts and
EUA  fact  sheets  for  the  most  up-to-date  manufacturer  information.  #Vaccine  doses
administered  up  to  4  days  before  the  minimum  interval  may  be  counted  and  do  not
need to be repeated. March 1, 2024 February 12, 2024 January 18, 2024 November 3,
