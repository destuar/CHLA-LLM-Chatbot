cyanide,  the  following  signs  and  symptoms  may  develop:  Symptoms  from  cyanide
poisoning  can  progress  very  rapidly  when  exposed  to  a  large  amount  of  cyanide.
Exposure to a large amount of cyanide by any route (breathing, absorbing through skin,
eating,  or  drinking),  may  cause  other  health  effects  as  well:  Taking  off  all  layers  of
clothing  (including  jewelry  and  accessories),  blotting  any  liquid,  and  showering  is  the
best  method  for  removing  cyanide  from  your  body.  Ideally,  undress  and  shower
immediately or as soon as you can, as described below. If you cannot take off all layers,
take  off  as  many  clothes  as  you  can.  Cyanide  poisoning  is  treated  with  specific
antidotes  and  supportive  medical  care  in  a  hospital  setting  or  by  trained  emergency
personnel. Antidotes for cyanide poisoning are most useful if given as soon as possible
after exposure. The most important thing is for victims to seek medical treatment as
soon as possible. If someone has ingested cyanide, do NOT induce vomiting. Survivors
of  significant  cyanide  exposure  may  develop  heart,  brain,  and  nerve  damage.  For  a
