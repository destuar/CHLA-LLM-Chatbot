traveling. The thought of traveling with your breastfeeding baby can feel overwhelming,
but breastfeeding provides several benefits to parents and children traveling together.
Breastfeeding  can  provide  a  source  of  comfort  for  babies  whose  normal  routine  is
disrupted due to travel. In addition to providing the ideal nutrition for your baby, breast
milk  keeps  babies  hydrated.  Breastfed  babies  under  6  months  do  not  need  to  drink
water  or  any  other  liquids,  even  in  hot  weather.  By  planning  ahead,  you  can
successfully continue to nurse and/or express milk for your baby. If you are traveling
without your child and plan on continuing breastfeeding, you will need to take certain
steps  to  maintain  your  milk  supply.  Working  with  a  lactation  support  provider  or
pediatrician  may  also  be  helpful  to  plan  for  your  specific  situation.  Maintaining  a  full
milk  supply  can  be  a  concern  for  many  traveling  parents.  Here  are  some  tips  for
preserving your milk supply while traveling: To receive email updates about this topic,
