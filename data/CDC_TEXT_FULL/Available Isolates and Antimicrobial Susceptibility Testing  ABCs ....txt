surveillance  (ABCs)  pathogens  are  available  upon  request  by  year  with  certain
demographic  and  clinical  data  and  laboratory  testing  results.  Information  on
antimicrobial  susceptibility  is  also  available  for  three  pathogens.  CDC  isolate  bank

cost  associated  with  isolate  requests  from  for-profit  institutions.  All  requestors  are
required to pay shipping fees. Isolates are available between 1995–2021 with certain
