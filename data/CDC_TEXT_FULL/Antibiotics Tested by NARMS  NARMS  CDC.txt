susceptibility.  This  task  is  accomplished  by  finding  the  lowest  concentration  of  a
particular  antibiotic  that  will  inhibit  the  growth  of  the  bacteria,  which  is  called  the
minimum  inhibitory  concentration  (MIC).  Currently  CDC  NARMS  routinely  tests  for
susceptibility  to  18  antibiotic  agents  that  are  in  12  classes  of  drugs.  The  names  and
classes of drugs and the testing methods used for susceptibility testing depend on the
type  of  bacteria  being  tested:  *  N/A  indicates  that  no  MIC  range  of  intermediate
susceptibility exists
†Cefepime  MICs  above  the  susceptible  range,  but  below  the  resistant  range  are
designated by CLSI to be susceptible-dose dependent (S-DD)
‡CLSI breakpoints are not established for streptomycin;  interpretive standards used are
NARMS-established  breakpoints  for  resistance  monitoring  and  should  not  be  used  to
predict clinical efficacy. During 1996–2013 resistance was defined as ≥64 µg/mL; the
breakpoint  was  updated  to  ≥32  µg/mL  in  2014.  The  2014  breakpoint  could  not  be
applied to previous years due to limited concentrations tested.
§ Broad-spectrum β-lactam antimicrobial agent only tested for non-typhoidal Salmonella
isolates displaying ceftriaxone and/or ceftiofur resistance during 2011–2015.
¶ CLSI updated the ceftriaxone interpretive standards in January 2010. NARMS Human
Isolate reports for 1996 through 2008 used susceptible ≤8 μg/mL, intermediate 16–32
μg/mL, and resistant ≥64 μg/mL.
**CLSI  breakpoints  for  azithromycin  are  only  established  for  Salmonella  ser.  Typhi.
Interpretive  criteria  for  Salmonella  ser.  Typhi  are  based  on  MIC  distribution  data  and
limited  clinical  data.  The  azithromycin  interpretive  standards  used  for  Salmonella
serotypes  other  than  ser.  Typhi  are  NARMS-established  breakpoints  for  resistance
monitoring and should not be used to predict clinical efficacy.

§ CLSI  interpretive standards for azithromycin are only established for Shigella sonnei
and Shigella flexneri. In December 2015, CLSI established epidemiological cutoff values
(ECVs) for Shigella species sonnei and flexneri. The ECVs should not be used as clinical
breakpoints  and  CLSI  uses  the  terms  “wild-type”  and  “non-wild-type”  instead  of
susceptible  and  resistant,  respectively,  to  reflect  the  nature  of  the  populations  of
bacteria  in  each  group  and  to  highlight  that  these  categories  are  not  to  be  used  to
predict clinical efficacy. The azithromycin  interpretive standards used for other Shigella
species are NARMS-established breakpoints for resistance monitoring and should not be
used to predict clinical efficacy.

NARMS  Human  Isolate  Reports  for  1996  through  2015  used  susceptible  ≤1  µg/mL,

† MIC interpretative standard is based on epidemiological cutoff values established by
the  European  Committee  on  Antimicrobial  Susceptibility  Testing  (EUCAST  –  last
accessed on 7/21/2017). This approach was adopted in 2012 and applied to all years.
EUCAST  uses  the  terms  “wild-type”  and  “non-wild-type”  instead  of  susceptible  and
resistant, respectively, to reflect the nature of the populations of bacteria in each group
and to highlight that these categories are not to be used to predict clinical efficacy.
‡ A telithromycin ECV for Campylobacter coli is not currently published by EUCAST. We
apply the previously published [PDF – 3 pages] ECV of 4 µg/mL to all C. coli isolates,
designating  “wild-type”  isolates  (MIC  ≤4  µg/mL)  as  sensitive  and  “non-wild-type”
isolates  (MIC  ≥8  µg/mL)  as  resistant.  *N/A  indicates  that  no  MIC  range  of  either
intermediate or resistant susceptibility exists

‡ Concentration range used for azithromycin in 2015
§CLSI  has  only  established  a  susceptible  breakpoint  (≤2  µg/mL)  for  azithromycin  and
cautions that the utility of this interpretation for Vibrio species other than V. cholerae is
uncertain due to limited clinical or in vitro MIC data. Because of this, NARMS will not
apply any interpretive criteria to azithromycin MICs for non-cholerae Vibrio until further
data are available.
¶  CLSI  updated  the  imipenem  interpretive  standards  in  October,  2015.  The  previous
breakpoints  were  susceptible  ≤4  µg/mL,  intermediate  8  µg/mL,  and  resistant  ≥16
µg/mL. NARMS Isolate Submission Login
