https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd18.200323. PEER REVIEWED What is already known on this
topic?  Chronic  disease  management  often  focuses  on  what  is  wrong  with  patients
rather than recognizing their strengths and resources. However, studies show the value
of emphasizing personal strengths to improve outcomes. What is added by this report?
How instruments evaluate personal strengths varies, making it especially difficult when
determining  the  use  of  instruments  in  clinical  populations.  This  systematic  review
defines  the  heterogeneity  of  constructs  that  research  has  used  to  examine  personal
strengths as well as the reliability and validity of strengths-related scales. What are the
implications for public health practice? Understanding the value of these various scales
can inform public health, and specifically primary care practice, to improve the care of
adults managing 1 or more chronic conditions. Introduction Most health care focuses on
patients’  deficits  to  encourage  behavior  change.  A  strengths-based  approach,  which
relies on identifying patient strengths, has great potential to facilitate behavior change
for  chronic  disease  management.  Little  is  known  about  instruments  used  to  assess
patient strengths. We conducted a systematic review to identify validated instruments
that  assess  personal  strengths  by  using  a  theory  elaboration  approach.  Methods  We
searched 8 databases including Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied
Health  (CINAHL),  and  PsycINFO  (through  July  2019)  to  identify  peer  reviewed,
English-language  studies  that  described  strength-based  instruments.  Thereafter,  we
evaluated  the  validity  and  reliability  of  the  instruments  according  to  18  Scientific
Advisory  Committee  of  the  Medical  Outcome  Trust  (SACMOT)  criteria,  and  used  an
inductive, iterative editing process to identify constructs measured by the instruments.
Results  We  identified  26  instruments  that  met  our  inclusion  criteria.  The  instruments
were validated in various clinical and nonclinical populations. Only 4 instruments met
most of the SACMOT criteria for validation. We extracted 91 unique constructs that fell
into 3 domains: inner strengths (49), external strengths (13), and personality constructs
(29).  Conclusion  A  limited  number  of  reliable  and  valid  instruments  are  available  to
assess strengths for the adult population, particularly for clinical populations. Internal
strengths can be leveraged to improve patient health; however, the development and
validation  of  additional  instruments  to  capture  personal  strengths  is  necessary  to
examine  the  multilevel  influence  of  external  strengths  on  individual  behaviors  and
well-being. Top Approximately half of all US adults have 1 or more diagnosed chronic
conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis (1). In 2016, the direct health
care cost associated with chronic health conditions was $1.1 trillion dollars (2). Chronic
conditions  can  be  managed  successfully  by  changing  unhealthy  behaviors  (3–7).
Patients,  with  their  care  team,  can  identify  strategies  and  leverage  skills  to  regulate
behaviors (4). A strengths-based approach to chronic disease management can support
self-management  and  behavior  change.  The  strengths-based  approach  emerged  from
the  social  work  field  and  counteracts  the  deficit-based  approach  from  the  health
science professions. A deficit-based approach focuses on what is wrong with patients
rather  than  recognizing  their  strengths  and  resources  (8).  The  strengths-based
approach assumes that individuals have the capacity to grow, do the best they can, and
know what is best for them (8). Strengths include personal attributes such as faith, use
of humor, flexibility; interpersonal assets such as friends or family who can be called on
for  help;  and  external  resources  such  as  ability  to  access  community  resources  for
health.  Whereas  deficit-based  approaches  to  chronic  disease  management  focus  on
patients’ problems and behavioral shortcomings (eg, focusing on patient challenges in
engaging with recommended behaviors), Rotegård et al (9) defined patient strengths,
or  health  assets,  as  “the  repertoire  of  potentials  —  internal  and  external  strength
qualities  in  the  individual’s  possession,  both  innate  and  acquired  —  that  mobilize
positive health behaviors and optimal health/wellness outcomes.” In practice, the care
team  works  with  a  patient  to  identify  their  inherent  strengths  and  the  patient  uses
these  strengths  to  promote  recovery  and  well-being  (10).  The  strengths-based
approaches in counseling and case management are associated with an improvement
in  depressive  symptoms,  substance  use  behaviors,  and  postsurgery  recovery  by
improving  key  determinants  such  as  perceived  patient  empowerment  (3,5,9,11–13).
Implementing  a  strengths-based  approach  relies  on  identifying  a  patient’s  strengths
(14–17).  However,  eliciting  a  patient’s  strengths  informally  is  challenging  during
time-constrained clinical visits (18). A formal strengths elicitation approach is needed to
provide the structure during clinic visits to support patients in suggesting strengths to
leverage  (16).  A  concept  analysis  developed  a  theoretical  framework  for  patient
strengths (9); however, this framework was based on health assets in nursing care of
cancer  patients.  Little  is  known  about  how  patient  strengths  are  operationalized  as  a
construct
 in
 existing
 validated
 assessments
 —
 either
 broadly
 or
 among
noninstitutionalized  or  community-based  populations  that  frequent  health  care  to
manage  a  chronic  condition  (ie,  clinical  populations).  Moreover,  the  construct  of
personal strengths has not been clearly defined in the literature, which could result in
difficulties in distinguishing constructs from each other and instruments that may not
adequately capture or sufficiently reflect the phenomenon. The objective of our study
was  to  identify  and  systematically  summarize  constructs  that  measure  dimensions  of
personal  strengths.  Specifically,  we  were  interested  in  understanding  what  we  know
about personal strengths and the extent to which instruments that measure personal
strengths  are  validated  for  application  in  chronic  care  management.  We  reviewed
instruments  for  measuring  personal  strengths  by  using  the  process  of  theory
elaboration, to make a theoretical contribution in the field through specification of the
aspects of the broad construct of personal strengths. The process of theory elaboration
uses an existing model or conceptual idea as the basis for developing new theoretical
insights,  through  contrasting,  specifying,  or  structuring  theoretical  constructs  to
improve  our  understanding  of  the  measurement  of  personal  strengths  (19).  Although
only a limited number of scales are specifically related to chronic disease management,
examining currently validated scales that have been used in adults more broadly can
provide information on what constructs and scales can be applied in populations that
are  managing  chronic  conditions.  The  results  can  inform  the  use  of  strengths-based
scales  in  clinic  settings  for  populations  managing  chronic  conditions.  Top  Personal
strengths is a broad construct; therefore, identifying dimensions of personal strengths
can  elucidate  the  multidimensionality  of  the  construct.  We  used  a  theory  elaboration
approach  for  the  analysis,  specifically  to  improve  construct  validation  and  provide
clarity of the scope of each dimension of personal strength as evidenced by previously
conducted empirical studies (19). This systematic review was conducted in accordance
with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)
guidelines  (20).  First,  we  conducted  a  search  of  peer-reviewed  literature  to  identify
validated  instruments  that  operationalized  strength  constructs.  Second,  we  extracted
information  from  the  instrument  about  constructs,  reliability,  and  validity.  Finally,  we
grouped  constructs  into  categories  defined  by  the  health  assets  framework  to
understand  at  what  level  personal  strengths  (eg,  inner,  personality,  external)  are
measured by the instruments (9). Personal strengths can be innate or acquired. Health
assets are influenced by antecedents (eg, values, beliefs), an individual’s potential to
pull from internal assets such as motivation, or external assets such as interpersonal
support,  to  mobilize  themselves  to  engage  in  positive  health  behaviors  and  improve
their  health  (9).  We  conducted  the  literature  search  to  include  any  articles  published
from  the  earliest  articles  in  each  database  through  July  1,  2019.  We  worked  with  a
university  librarian  to  implement  a  search  of  peer-reviewed  articles  that  combined
phrases  to  describe  strengths  and  data  collection  instrument  in  PubMed,  Web  of
Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), PsycINFO, PsycTESTS,
Social  Work  Abstracts,  the  Health  and  Psychosocial  Instruments,  and  Embase.  After
limiting results to humans and English-language articles and removing duplicates, the
broad search was still explosive — returning more than 20,000 references. Therefore,
we  identified  the  strengths-related  search  terms  with  the  worst  specificity  (ie,  the
largest absolute number of false positives based on a review of sampled abstracts for
each  term).  The  most  problematic  terms  identified  included  “strength*”,  “health
resource*”, “protective factor*”, and “resilience”. Thereafter, we reviewed a randomly
selected  sample  of  100  references  and  in  working  with  the  librarian,  we  replaced
“strength*”  in  the  main  search  with  more  specific  terms  capable  of  identifying
appropriate  references  to  balance  a  broad  search  with  efficiency  (ie,  inner  strength).
Lastly, we reviewed any review papers (literature, scoping, systematic, meta-analysis)
to  further  identify  potentially  relevant  primary  sources.  Once  we  finalized  our  search
strategy, we downloaded relevant citations to EndNoteX8 (Thomson ISI ResearchSoft), a
reference management software. The search yielded 3,976 records. We were interested
in  instruments  that  assessed  strengths;  therefore,  we  identified  studies  that  met  the
following  criteria:  1)  measured  strengths  at  the  individual,  interpersonal,  or
environmental  level;  2)  applied  the  instrument  to  an  adult  population;  3)  presented
reliability  or  validity  information;  4)  used  a  structured,  self-reported  questionnaire  to
assess  strengths;  5)  had  instruments  that  comprised  3  or  more  strength-related
dimensions (ie, constructs); and 6) were peer-reviewed and published in English before
July 2019. We also included instruments developed in languages other than English with
findings written in English. We did not include studies focused on child and adolescent
samples because strengths may manifest differently across the developmental period.
We also excluded studies if they either measured strengths as a subscale of a larger
instrument  or  used  qualitative  instruments  (eg,  semi-structured  interviews).  For
screening we had 2 pairs of reviewers independently screen titles and abstracts. The
full team met to resolve disagreements, reach consensus, and revisit the inclusion and
exclusion  criteria.  If  we  could  not  reach  consensus,  the  abstract  was  included  for
full-text review. Full-text review comprised 3 teams of 2 who closely assessed studies
against  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  with  a  focus  on  reported  reliability  and
validity information for strengths constructs. We extracted descriptive characteristics,
definitions  of  each  construct,  and  reliability  and  validity  information.  For  descriptive
characteristics, we documented the purpose of the measure, the target population(s) in
which  the  instrument  was  meant  to  be  used  (eg,  gender-defined  or  clinically  defined
populations), and the settings in which the instrument was applied. To assess reliability
and validity information for each instrument we developed a structured extraction form
by  using  the  Scientific  Advisory  Committee  of  the  Medical  Outcome  Trust  (SACMOT)
criteria (21). The 23 criteria are in 8 domains: conceptual models, reliability, validity,
responsiveness,  interpretability,  burden,  modes  of  administration,  and  cultural  and
language adaptations or translations (Table 1). Key validity criteria were face, content,
criterion-related  and  construct  validity,  and  reliability  measures.  Validity  studies  for
each  instrument  were  reviewed,  and  2  reviewers  (D.D.W.  and  R.N.K.)  independently
extracted validity data for each instrument by using the SACMOT criteria. Results were
compared  and  any  inconsistencies  were  resolved  through  team  discussion.  The  first
author reviewed all extraction for quality assurance. We created a table that included a
row for every construct and the original definition from the source instrument to ensure
fidelity throughout the extraction and synthesis process. Overlapping constructs were
grouped together based on the similarity of their definitions. To organize the final table,
we  adapted  the  health  assets  framework  developed  by  Rotegård  and  colleagues  (9).
Two  authors  (D.D.W.  and  R.N.K.)  independently  categorized  each  construct  into  the
framework  domains.  Although  the  health  assets  framework  distinguishes  between
assets (ie, strengths) and self-awareness, we considered self-awareness as a potential
asset and coded constructs into this domain when appropriate. We developed emergent
domains for constructs that did not fit into the existing framework. Finally, subdomains
were  created  to  reflect  groups  of  constructs  within  domains.  Unique  constructs  that
were  extracted  from  nonvalidated  instruments  were  kept  for  the  purposes  of
showcasing the diversity of strengths-related constructs and the gaps in validation. Top
Beginning  with  3,976  articles  and  after  removing  1,807  duplicates,  2,169  articles
remained (Figure). We excluded 2,057 articles during title and abstract review for not
specifying a focus on strengths-related predictors or outcomes, not being published in
English,  or  using  a  child  or  adolescent  sample  only.  During  the  full-text  review,  we
excluded  an  additional  86  non-English,  non–peer  reviewed,  or  not  strength-relevant
studies.  This  review  yielded  20  studies  that  met  our  inclusion  criteria  and  underwent
data  extraction.  Some  studies  had  multiple  strengths  instruments,  thereby  producing
26  instruments  for  review.  We  extracted  information  about  the  populations  in  which
these instruments were validated and sorted them (Table 2).

Among the instruments assessed, 19 of 26 were developed in the United States, with
the remaining 7 developed in Australia, Canada, Norway, Spain, Israel, the Netherlands,
and  the  United  Kingdom.  Instruments  were  developed  between  1957  and  2013.
Although  our  method  ensured  all  instruments  were  evaluated  in  at  least  1  validity
study,  the  number  of  validity  studies  ranged  from  1  (eg,  the  Balanced  Measure  of
Psychological Needs instrument [22]) to 55 (the California Psychological Inventory [23]),
which  is  also  the  oldest  instrument.  Each  instrument  was  validated  for  1  or  more
populations (Table 2). Among the 26 instruments that matched our inclusion criteria, 5
focused  on  clinical  settings.  For  example,  the  Cancer  Empowerment  Questionnaire
measures  strengths  that  cancer  patients  and  survivors  derive  from  themselves  and
their social network (24,25). The Chronic Illness Resources Survey assesses support and
resources at the individual, interpersonal, and community level (26). The Inner Strength
Questionnaire  was  constructed  and  validated  among  women  with  chronic  illnesses  in
the United States (27). The Resilience Scale for Adults was constructed for outpatient
adults  in  Norway  (28).  Although  5  instruments  were  developed  specifically  for  clinic
populations, an additional 7 instruments were developed in nonclinic settings but later
validated  in  various  clinic  populations,  including  the  Big  Five  Personality  (29),  Brief
COPE (30,31), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (32), Five-Factor Personality Inventory
(33),  Interpersonal  Support  Evaluation  List  (34),  Life  Attitude  Profile  (35,36),  and
Post-traumatic  Growth  Inventory  (37,38).  The  Caregiver  Well-being  Scale  assesses
family caregivers’ strengths and domains where additional support is desirable for the
caregiver  (39).  We  used  18  SACMOT  criteria  (21)  to  examine  scale  construction,
reliability,  and  validity.  These  18  criteria  were  reliability,  reliability  data  collection,
reliability  estimates,  reliability  coefficient  calculations,  methods  for  reproducibility,
test-retest
 or
 inter-rater
 reliability,
 validity
 rationale,

 population,

 testing,
criterion-related
 rationale,
 responsiveness,
 interpretability,
 respondent
 burden,
administrative  burden,  administration  modes,  and  cultural  and  language  adaptations
(Table  1).  We  found  that  the  instruments  with  the  most  evidence  of  validity  and
reliability were the Big Five Personality (14 of 18 criteria), the California Psychological
Inventory (13 of 18 criteria), the Resilience Scale for Adults (14 of 18 criteria), and the
Sense of Coherence Scale (13 of 18 criteria) (40). We found that definitions were clear
for  each  construct,  fulfilling  the  first  SACMOT  criterion  (Table  1).  All  instruments  had
information  on  the  dimensionality  and  distinctiveness  of  measured  constructs.  Most
instruments (25 of 26) reported reliability estimates, such as a Cronbach α value (41).
Of the 26 instruments, 23 had at least 1 article detailing evidence on content validity,
or the extent to which the items reflect the construct (42). Relatedly, construct validity
measures comprised evidence for convergent and discriminant validity. We found 22 of
26 instruments assessed construct validity (eg, convergent and discriminant validity).
Most  instruments  had  measures  of  internal  consistency  to  ensure  reliability  of  the
instrument  and  had  reproducibility  measures.  Of  the  26  instruments,  15  had
information  on  less  than  50%  of  the  SACMOT  criteria.  The  criterion  with  the  least
evidence  was  an  evaluation  of  the  administrative  burden  (2  of  26)  and  alternative
modes of administering the instrument (3 of 26). We found 91 distinct constructs (Table
3).  Most  instruments  contained  unique  constructs,  indicating  that  constructs  did  not
conceptually  overlap  with  each  other  across  instruments.  Common  constructs  across
instruments  included  flexibility,  spiritual  strength,  and  autonomy.  We  organized  the
constructs  into  3  domains  based  on  the  health  assets  framework  developed  by
Rotegård  et  al  (9):  inner  strengths,  external  strengths,  and  personality  constructs.
Approximately half of the constructs were coded as inner strengths (n = 49). On the
basis of the framework, inner strengths comprised constructs that measure how people
relate  to  others  and  their  environment  (relational,  n  =  17),  what  drives  people  when
they encounter challenging situations (motivational, n = 10), characteristics that buffer
individuals  from  undesired  health  outcomes  (protective,  n  =  6),  self-determination  to
accomplish goals (volitional, n = 9), and self-reflective characteristics (self-awareness,
n  =  7).  Of  91  constructs,  13  were  coded  as  external  strengths,  split  into  2  domains:
social  resources  and  institutional  support.  Whereas  social  resources  focus  more  on
interpersonal  resources,  such  as  forms  of  tangible  social  support  and  aid  (n  =  7),
institutional  support  contains  constructs  measuring  community  or  institutional-level
characteristics  that  could  support  positive  behaviors,  such  as  the  presence  of
community  organizations  (n  =  6).  We  classified  29  constructs  as  personality,  which
related  to  innate  individual  traits.  Most  of  these  personality  constructs  came  from
well-established  personality-based  instruments  such  as  the  Big  Five  Personality  or
Five-Factor  Personality  Inventory  (33).  Through  coding,  personality  constructs  were
further split into 2 subdomains. One was resourcefulness (n = 10), defined as the ability
to perform tasks independently or seek help from others when necessary. Constructs
coded  to  resourcefulness  included  those  pertaining  to  self-management  skills  and
knowledge  of  and  ability  to  use  resources.  The  second  subdomain  was  general
personality traits (n = 19) related to intelligence, justice, approach to interaction with
others,  positivity,  and  approaches  to  learning.  Top  Personal  strengths  is  a  broad
phenomenon  comprising  many  constructs  including  internal  strengths  such  as
self-efficacy  and  personality  or  interpersonal  strengths  such  as  social  support.
Strengths  can  also  come  from  community  and  social  levels;  however,  we  did  not
identify any validated scales focused on these higher-level strengths. The objective of
this  review  was  to  identify  and  systematically  summarize  constructs  that  measure
dimensions of personal strengths. This review shows evidence of a limited number of
reliable and valid instruments available to assess strengths for the adult population. We
identified 26 instruments, most of which were developed in the United States and had
reliability estimates. Content validity and construct validity were the most documented
forms of validity, and information on administrative burden was the least documented.
The  instruments  with  the  most  reliability  and  validity  evidence  were  personality
assessments  (Big  Five  Personality)  and  perceptions  of  interpersonal  reactions
(California  Psychological  Inventory)  and  resiliency  (Sense  of  Coherence  Scale).
Furthermore, 91 constructs are represented across the 26 instruments. Over 85 percent
of  constructs  focused  on  inner  strengths  or  personality  factors  rather  than  external
resources  (ie,  community  assets).  Most  of  the  constructs  were  focused  on  internal
resources,
 reflecting
 the
 overarching
 health
 care
 rhetoric
 and
 practice
 of
self-management,  which  is  focused  on  changing  the  individual  without  fully
acknowledging  the  potential  external  assets  that  can  be  used  to  promote
self-management  behaviors  (43,44).  These  results  are  consistent  with  a  review
conducted by Golden and Earp (45), which found that 95% of behavioral interventions
are conducted at the individual level and 67% are conducted at the interpersonal level.
Despite  evidence  showing  that  community-level  and  policy-level  factors  are  more
effective  than  individual-level  factors  to  change  health  behaviors,  very  few
interventions are done at these levels (46). Overall, the rich set of constructs identified
as inner strengths or personality factors can be leveraged to improve patients’ health in
primary  care  settings.  Additional  instruments  focused  on  external  assets  can  be
developed  to  capture  personal  strengths  and  improve  patient  care  more  holistically.
The variability in validation studies may result from the high number of constructs used
as  proxies  for  personal  strength;  therefore,  proper  validity  testing  is  necessary  to
advance the measurement of this broad construct. One specific type of validation that
can help advance measurement is discriminant validity, which requires that measures
of distinctly different constructs not be correlated with each other (42). Advancements
in  discriminating  between  the  types  of  personal  strengths  can  be  made  by  further
applying  theory  elaboration  and  construct  proliferation  techniques  in  future  studies
(19,47).  In  considering  the  use  of  personal  strengths  to  inform  the  treatment  and
management  of  chronic  conditions  for  individuals,  studies  have  found  evidence  of
cultivating  personal  strengths  to  improve  self-management  behaviors  and  improve
patient health outcomes (48–50). However, we found that the number of instruments
developed  specifically  for  clinical  populations  or  validated  in  clinical  populations  is
limited. This may reflect how providers may focus on treating problems and identifying
risk  factors  rather  than  evaluating  patients  on  their  personal  strengths  that  can  be
integrated  as  part  of  the  treatment  plan.  Therefore,  additional  studies  are  needed  to
develop  instruments  to  measure  personal  strengths  in  clinical  populations.  Relatedly,
interventions are needed in health care settings to integrate validated instruments and
relevant items from those instruments in clinical care to identify personal strengths and
to start conversations about strengths-based approaches to improving chronic disease
management. These interventions could target clinician awareness of instruments and
knowledge of how to apply and interpret the results as a means of improving care. Our
systematic review found that few instruments assess strengths at the community and
societal  levels  to  emphasize  an  ecological  approach  to  strengths  identification.  Most
instruments were not developed specifically for clinical populations, therefore additional
testing  is  needed  in  these  populations.  We  limited  our  inclusion  criteria  to  adults  but
recognize that validity assessments are needed for children and adolescents if they are
to be implemented in clinical settings, particularly in primary care settings. Although we
examined instruments validated in adult populations, the studies described participants
homogenously rather than examining adults by different stages of the life course (eg,
older adults). Parsing out adults by these key developmental periods could be explored
given  that  health  care  is  sorted  by  age-specific  specialties,  such  as  geriatrics.  In
addition,  quality  of  life  instruments  were  not  included  in  this  search  as  these  assess
multiple domains of an individual’s well-being. For this review, we wanted to limit the
search  to  instruments  that  focus  primarily  on  assessing  personal  strengths  that  an
individual would have agency around, rather than instruments, such as health-related
quality  of  life,  that  are  broader  constructs  with  a  subdomain  assessing  strength.  Our
search  may  have  been  biased  toward  Western  epistemologies,  thereby  excluding
important strengths such as cultural group membership and connection, as research in
Black  psychology  emphasizes  (51).  Resilience,  an  important  characteristic  all  on  its
own, was not included in our literature search because of how large the search results
became.  In  addition,  many  of  the  instruments  were  validated  in  the  general  adult
population or college students. Primary care settings need strengths-based instruments
that  account  for  developmental  differences  across  adulthood  (eg,  younger  or  older
adults)  and  that  reflect  how  strengths  are  manifested  in  different  cultural,  racial,  or
ethnic  groups  (eg,  Black,  Indigenous,  Asian,  White).  To  ensure  the  validity  of  these
measures  in  different  populations,  additional  psychometric  testing  is  needed  to
determine  if  each  construct  has  the  same  meaning  for  each  group.  Implementation
research is needed on how to use these instruments in health care settings in a way
that supports the workflow of clinicians and leverages patient-generated information as
part of the treatment process. Future research could use the constructs identified here
to  develop  a  comprehensive  instrument  of  patient  strengths  in  the  clinical  setting  to
improve  chronic  disease  management.  These  instruments  must  be  validated  across
multiple clinical populations, including those managing multiple chronic conditions such
as cancer, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. We have reviewed 26 reliable and valid
instruments  that  measure  personal  strengths  in  clinical  and  nonclinical  adult
populations.  Constructs  in  these  instruments  can  be  used  in  both  research  and  clinic
settings to improve self-management behaviors among people with chronic conditions.
Although  these  instruments  tap  into  different  forms  of  strengths,  few  instruments
assess  external  strengths  (eg,  interpersonal,  community).  The  development  and
validation  of  additional  instruments  to  capture  personal  strengths  is  necessary  to
examine  the  multilevel  influence  of  external  strengths  on  individual  behaviors  and
well-being. Top We thank the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) for
