NOTE:  Corrected  2018  fetal  death  files  were  posted  on  January  28,  2021.  These  files
replace those posted in July 2020. Changes were made to two data fields: “Cigarette
Recode” and “Cigarettes in 3rd Trimester”.  For the “Cigarette Recode” field, 22 records
were changed to Yes (17 records had previously been incorrectly coded as No, and 5
records had been incorrectly coded as Unknown or Not Stated).  For the “Cigarettes in
3rd Trimester” field, 1,265 records were changed – 992 records to categories ranging
between 1 and 98 daily cigarettes (17 records had previously incorrectly been coded as
0  and  975  records  had  been  incorrectly  coded  as  Unknown  or  Not  Stated)  and  273
records  to  0  (all  had  previously  incorrectly  been  coded  as  Unknown  or  Not  Stated).
Notice of Error in the 2003 and 2004 Fetal Death Data Files and Reports [PDF – 131 KB]
The  2014  public  use  fetal  death  data  file  has  been  updated  to  include  cause  of  fetal
death. No change has been made to other data items. A new 2014 Fetal Death Public
Use Record Layout including the cause of fetal death items can now be found at the end
of  the  User  Guide.    *  Between  2002  and  2003  the  uncompressed  file  size  increased
greatly.   This  increase  is  a  result  of  the  phased  implementation  of  the  newly  revised
U.S. Standard Certificate of Live Birth and a consequent need for a much longer record
length.   If  you  have  difficulty  unzipping  these  files,  you  may  need  to  use  different
compression software such as the newest versions of WinZip or WinRAR.   Please be
advised  that  the  births  files  are  massive  flatfiles  that  cannot  be  opened  using,  for
example,  a  text  editor  or  spreadsheet  application.   Using  some  type  of  statistical
software, such as SAS, SPSS, and STATA, is your best choice to open and run the files.
Since the birth files are flatfiles, you will need input code files. See the National Bureau
of Economic Research (NBER) website for SAS/SPSS/STATA input code files for the birth
files,  which  are  available  (free  of  charge).    A  collection  of  vital  statistics  products
including  tables,  data  files,  and  reports  that  allow  users  to  access  and  examine  vital
statistics and population data interactively.
