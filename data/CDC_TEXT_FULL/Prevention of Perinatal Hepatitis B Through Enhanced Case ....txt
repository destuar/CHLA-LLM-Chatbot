and the title of the report in the subject line of e-mail. Each year, an estimated 20,000
infants are born to women in
the United States who are positive for hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg). These infants are at high risk for perinatal hepatitis B
virus (HBV) infection and for chronic liver disease as adults. To
identify newborns who require immunoprophylaxis to prevent
perinatal HBV infection (1-4), all vaccine advisory groups have
recommended routine HBsAg screening of all pregnant women during an
early prenatal visit in each pregnancy. Federal funding to support
perinatal hepatitis B-prevention programs became available in 1990,
and by 1992, programs had been implemented in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia. Specific objectives of these programs are to
ensure that 1) all pregnant women are tested for HBsAg, and 2)
infants born to HBsAg-positive women receive hepatitis B immune
globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine at birth, with follow-up
doses of vaccine at ages 1 and 6 months (5). This report describes
the case-management features of successful hepatitis B-prevention
programs in Connecticut during 1994-95 and in the United States
during 1994.  Connecticut  In 1992, the Connecticut Department of Public Health
implemented a perinatal hepatitis B-prevention program and
recommended that 1) HBsAg-positive women be contacted before
delivery and educated about HBV infection, 2) the infant's
pediatrician and delivery hospital be informed of the mother's
HBsAg status, and 3) a tracking system be used to ensure the infant
receives appropriate postexposure prophylaxis. Local health
departments (LHDs) initially were responsible for providing
management  to  mother/infant  pairs.   Enhanced  case  management  (ECM)  was
implemented in two counties
in July 1994 and a third county in April 1995. In addition to use
of the basic recommendations, the ECM program employed a full-time
nurse (hired by the state) who worked on a flexible schedule to
manage all mother/infant pairs in the three-county area and a
computer-based tracking system to identify pending births to
infected mothers and the need for follow-up vaccine doses for
infants. To evaluate program effectiveness, outcomes in the ECM
program were compared with the LHD programs for HBsAg-positive
women  identified  during  1994-95.   During  1994-95,  the  ECM  program  identified  64
HBsAg-positive
pregnant women and maintained contact with all of these women
throughout their pregnancies. During this period, LHD programs
identified 71 HBsAg-positive pregnant women and established and/or
maintained contact with 58 (82%). The mothers in the LHD programs
resided in 27 different local health jurisdictions. Three of these
jurisdictions managed greater than or equal to 10 mothers, and 18
each managed one.  Documented compliance with the recommendation to administer
HBIG and the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of
birth was higher in the ECM group (100%) than in the LHD group
(90%) (Table 1). In addition, the rate of completion of the
three-dose series by 6-8 months after birth was higher in the ECM
program (91%) than the LHD programs (48%). No infants were lost to
follow-up in the ECM program; in comparison, seven (12%) infants in
the LHD programs were lost to follow-up without documentation that
the series was completed.  United States  In March 1996, CDC conducted a survey to
assess the
effectiveness of the 58 federally funded perinatal hepatitis
B-prevention programs for infants born to HBsAg-positive women in
the United States during 1994. Of 8252 infants born to
HBsAg-positive women, 7362 (89%) received HBIG and the first dose
of hepatitis B vaccine at birth, and 5042 (61%) completed
prophylaxis by age 6-8 months.  As part of this survey, program coordinators completed
a
questionnaire about key programmatic elements; 48 (76%) of the 58
programs provided complete information. ECM techniques associated
with an increased likelihood of vaccination of infants born to
HBsAg-positive mothers (Table_1) included routine reminders to
HBsAg-positive women that their status should be reported to the
delivery hospital, reporting of the maternal HBsAg status on the
newborn metabolic screening card or birth certificate, routine
reminders to the prenatal-care providers that the mother's HBsAg
status should be reported to the delivery hospital, and use of a
computer-based tracking system for HBsAg-positive pregnant women
and their infants.  Reported by: AJ Roome, MPH, M Rak, JL Hadler, MD, State
Epidemiologist, Connecticut Dept of Public Health. Epidemiology and
Surveillance Div, National Immunization Program; Hepatitis Br, Div
of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases, National Center for Infectious
Diseases, CDC.  Editorial Note: Administration of appropriate immunoprophylaxis is
approximately 90% effective in preventing perinatal HBV
transmission (6). Because infants who are incompletely vaccinated
with hepatitis B vaccine are at increased risk for perinatal HBV
infection and less likely to be protected against infection
compared with completely vaccinated children, timely provision of
HBIG and the appropriate doses of vaccine is essential to
prevention (7).  The findings in this report indicate that, compared with all
U.S. infants born to HBsAg-positive women, a substantially higher
proportion of such infants in the ECM program in Connecticut
received HBIG and were completely vaccinated with hepatitis B
vaccine by age 6-8 months. One potential explanation for the
increase in Connecticut was the use of comprehensive
case-management techniques, including employment of staff
specifically for the program, use of a computer-based tracking
system, and use of reminder letters. Similar techniques improved
case management in the national survey. In addition, reporting of
maternal HBsAg status on newborn metabolic screening cards or birth
certificates may help to ensure infants are vaccinated in the
hospital and entered into tracking and recall systems at the state
health department.  Perinatal hepatitis B-prevention programs without intensive
case management have been only moderately successful in ensuring
that children of HBsAg-positive mothers are identified and complete
the vaccine series by age 6-8 months. For example, in 1988, an
evaluation of patients served by a large municipal hospital
indicated that only 65% of infants at risk for perinatal HBV
infection had received both HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine within 7
days after delivery (8). In addition, among 832 infants identified
by a neonatal hepatitis B surveillance and vaccination program in
New York City in 1988, only 59% had received HBIG and completed the
vaccine series by age 18 months (9).  Although this report did not include cost analysis,
previous
studies associate substantial cost savings with prevention of
perinatal HBV transmission (10). For example, the estimated
lifetime medical costs for one patient with cirrhosis of the liver
(without transplantation) is $87,000; however, the costs associated
with the techniques employed by the ECM program were not estimated.
In addition, the integration of perinatal HBV-prevention programs
with existing and new perinatal screening programs (e.g., maternal
screening for human immunodeficiency virus and group B
streptococcal infections) may improve overall cost effectiveness of
these programs and facilitate comprehensive case management for
other diseases that affect newborns.  A national health objective for the year 2000 is to
reduce by
approximately 80% the number of perinatal HBV infections in the
United States (objective 20.3). Based on the national survey
described in this report, only half of all births to HBsAg-positive
mothers in the United States are reported to a perinatal hepatitis
B-prevention program and entered into a tracking system. Based on
recent studies, widespread use of comprehensive case-management
techniques similar to those used by newborn metabolic screening
programs are needed to achieve the year 2000 objective.  References
