 Generally, masks can help act as a filter to reduce the number of germs you breathe in
or out. Their effectiveness can vary against different viruses, for example, based on the
size  of  the  virus.  When  worn  by  a  person  who  has  a  virus,  masks  can  reduce  the
chances they spread it to others. Masks can also protect wearers from inhaling germs;
this type of protection typically comes from better fitting masks (for example, N95 or
KN95 respirators).   There are many different types of masks that have varying abilities
to block viruses depending on their design and how well they fit against your face. Cloth
masks generally offer lower levels of protection to wearers, surgical/disposable masks
usually  offer  more  protection,  international  filtering  facepiece  respirators  (like  KN95
respirators) offer even more, and the most protective respirators are NIOSH Approved®
filtering  facepiece  respirators  (like  N95®  respirators).  All  of  the  prevention  strategies
described  in  this  guidance  can  be  helpful  to  reduce  risk.  They  are  especially  helpful
