(ARI)  Interactive  Dashboard  is  powered  by  data  provided  through  the  New  Vaccine
Surveillance  Network  (NVSN).   NVSN  conducts  active  sentinel  surveillance  for  acute
respiratory illnesses in children aged less than 18 years old. The dashboard tracks the
following  respiratory  viruses  in  children:  Participants  are  enrolled  through  outpatient
clinics, urgent care facilities, emergency departments, and hospitals at seven pediatric
medical centers in the United States. Enrolled children are systematically tested for the
respiratory  viruses  listed  above  by  reverse-transcription  polymerase  chain  reaction
(RT-PCR) testing. The NVSN Pediatric ARI dashboard displays respiratory virus detection
trends  at  surveillance  sites  and  may  differ  from  trends  in  other  parts  of  the  United
States.  NVSN  ARI  data  are  preliminary  and  subject  to  change  as  more  data  become
available.  Testing  results  for  recent  cases  are  subject  to  reporting  delays,  which  are
noted  as  either  a  dashed  line  or  a  shaded  blue  box.  Reporting  delays  may  increase
around  holidays  or  during  periods  of  increased  respiratory  illness.  As  new  data  are
received  each  week,  data  from  previous  weeks  may  be  updated  to  include  delayed
reports.  NVSN  is  CDCâ€™s  multi-pathogen  surveillance  network  to  assess  pediatric  viral
respiratory  and  gastrointestinal  infections  and  vaccine  impact  in  children.  Languages
