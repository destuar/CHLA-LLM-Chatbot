dangerous bacteria that affect people and cattle The National Antimicrobial Resistance
Monitoring System for Enteric Bacteria (NARMS) was established in 1996. NARMS is a
collaboration among state and local public health departments, CDC, the U.S. Food and
Drug  Administration  (FDA),  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA).  This
national  public  health  surveillance  system  tracks  changes  in  the  antimicrobial
susceptibility  of  certain  enteric  (intestinal)  bacteria  found  in  ill  people  (CDC),  retail
meats  (FDA),  and  food  animals  (USDA)  in  the  United  States.  The  NARMS  program  at
CDC  helps  protect  public  health  by  providing  information  about  emerging  bacterial
resistance, the ways in which resistance is spread, and how resistant infections differ
from susceptible infections.
