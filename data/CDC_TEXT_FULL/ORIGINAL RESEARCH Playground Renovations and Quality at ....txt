Introduction
Recreational  and  transportation  infrastructure  can  promote  physical  activity  among
children  and  adolescents.  The  Play  Across  Boston  community-based  research  project
sought  to  estimate  and  compare  playground  renovation  rates  across  Boston  areas
before and after a playground quality assessment, to describe changes in playground
quality  among  a  subset  of  parks,  and  to  document  features  of  local  transportation
infrastructure around parks. Methods
We  used  an  observational  pretest-posttest  design  to  estimate  playground  renovation
rates among 103 city-operated parks. Renovation rates were calculated on the basis of
annual city Parks Department capital budgets from fiscal years 1996 through 2007. We
used  the  same  design  to  describe  changes  between  a  2000  to  2001  baseline
assessment of playground quality and a 2007 follow-up measured via observation of a
subsample of 18 low-scoring parks in disadvantaged areas. We used 
χ2
 analysis  to  compare  percentages  of  playgrounds  renovated  across  city  areas  before
and  after  baseline  assessment,  logistic  regression  analysis  to  calculate  odds  ratios
comparing renovation rates after baseline by city area, and paired t tests to compare
playground quality at baseline and follow-up. Results
Overall playground renovation rates before (29%) and after (34%) baseline 
assessment were similar. Parks scoring low on playground quality at baseline 
were  renovated  after  baseline  at  a  higher  rate  than  high-scoring  playgrounds.  After
accounting  for  baseline  playground  quality,  parks  in  disadvantaged  areas  were
renovated at a rate similar to those in other areas. Playground quality scores improved
between
baseline (mean, 38.3; 95% confidence 
interval, 35.3-41.3) and 2007 in a subsample of previously 
low-scoring parks in disadvantaged areas. Conclusion
The findings of the 2007 follow-up assessment indicate an equitable rate of playground
renovation  across  city  areas  according  to  need.  Back  to  top  Physical  activity  among
children and adolescents can provide lifelong health 
benefits. Compared with their inactive peers, physically active children and 
youths have better cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular strength, less body 
fat, better cardiovascular and metabolic risk factor profiles, stronger bones, 
and better mental health (1). Physically active youths are more likely to 
continue a physically active lifestyle into adulthood (2), contributing to 
reduced risk of several chronic diseases, including obesity, coronary heart 
disease,  hypertension,  type  2  diabetes,  and  some  cancers  (3).  Features  of  the  built
environment can promote physical activity and improve 
health (4,5). Studies among youths have shown that access to recreational 
facilities, including parks — in particular, park amenities such as playgrounds 
— is associated with increased levels of physical activity (6,7). Although 
playgrounds can provide an inviting setting to promote active play, the quality 
of playgrounds can be a concern for parents (8) and can vary according to 
neighborhood  socioeconomic  characteristics  (9).  Transportation  infrastructure  is  also
associated with physical activity among 
youths (5). The presence and condition of sidewalks, presence of controlled 
street crossings (ie, traffic lights and crosswalks), and existence of road 
hazards, such as speeding traffic, have all been linked to physical activity 
levels among youths (5). Traffic engineering countermeasures that reduce the 
risk of pedestrian and cyclist injuries, such as increasing the visibility of 
pedestrians and cyclists and reducing vehicle speeds (10), may also promote 
physical activity. Better traffic control and an infrastructure that promotes 
pedestrian and bicycle safety have been associated with more frequent walking 
and cycling to recreational facilities among youths (11), thus creating safe 
opportunities for them to be physically active, both while using recreational 
facilities  and  while  traveling  to  and  from  them.  Since  1999,  the  Play  Across  Boston
(PAB) project has worked with community 
partners to document youth sports and physical activity resources in Boston and 
to monitor ongoing citywide efforts in reducing documented disparities in access 
to physical activity facilities and increasing program participation. PAB is a 
project of the Harvard Prevention Research Center at the Harvard School of 
Public Health undertaken in collaboration with Northeastern University’s Center 
for the Study of Sport in Society and a broad-based community advisory board. 
The background of PAB and that of the community process facilitating project 
development and implementation are described in detail elsewhere (12,13). 
Briefly, following several community engagement activities, PAB led a 
comprehensive community-based assessment of physical activity programs and 
facilities for Boston youths from 1999 through 2001. Between July 2000 and July 
2001, PAB staff observed playground quality at 145 public parks in Boston, 
identified playgrounds most in need of repair or renovation, and found that 
playground quality varied by socioeconomic and racial composition of local 
neighborhoods  (9).  Beginning  in  the  summer  of  2001,  assessment  findings  were
disseminated to 
community leaders to facilitate data-driven action for reducing observed 
disparities in opportunities for physical activity among youths in disadvantaged 
neighborhoods (13). In 2007, PAB conducted a follow-up study to describe changes 
in playground quality after its dissemination of the baseline findings. 
The objectives of this second study were to 1) estimate and compare playground 
renovation rates across city areas during the years before and after the PAB 
baseline playground quality assessment in 2000 to 2001, 2) describe changes in 
observed playground quality among a subset of parks, and 3) describe features of 
local bicycle and pedestrian transportation infrastructure that might influence 
access to public parks. Back to top This study used an observational pretest-posttest
design with no control arm: 1) to estimate citywide playground renovation rates from
fiscal  year  (FY)  1996  to  FY  2007  and  2)  to  describe  changes  in  playground  quality
among  a  subsample  of  public  parks  in  an  area  of  socioeconomically  disadvantaged
neighborhoods  between  a  2000  to  2001  baseline  assessment  and  an  August  2007
follow-up.  This  study  also  used  a  cross-sectional  design  to  describe  features  of  local
bicycle and
pedestrian  transportation  infrastructure  surrounding  the  parks  in  the  subsample.  The
setting for this study was Boston, Massachusetts. In the 2000 US Census, Boston had
589,141 residents, 116,559 (20%) of whom were younger than 18 years. Among these
youths,  37%  were  black,  25%  white,  24%  Hispanic,  7%  Asian,  and  6%  of  another
race/ethnicity.  Twenty-three  percent  of  families  with  children  younger  than  18  years
had  household  incomes  below  the  poverty  level  (14).  The  percentage  of  Boston  high
school 
students who meet recommended levels of physical activity 
(30%) is lower
than  both  national  (35%)  and  state  (41%)  averages  and  is  lower  among  racial/ethnic
minorities than among whites (15). All 103 public parks operated by the Boston Parks
and  Recreation  Department  (Parks  Department)  that  were  assessed  for  playground
quality  at  the  PAB  baseline  were  eligible  for  this  study.  Forty-two  parks  that  were
assessed  for  playground  quality  at  the  PAB  baseline  were  not  eligible  because  they
were  operated  by  other  city  or  state  agencies.  The  city  public  health  agency  and
community  partners  have  worked  with  7  of  Boston’s  16  neighborhoods  to  address
health  promotion  around  chronic  disease  risk  factors,  including  physical  activity,
through  the  Boston  Steps  program,  funded  by  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  and
Prevention,  and  the  Boston  Collaborative  for  Food  and  Fitness,  funded  by  the  W.K.
Kellogg  Foundation.  These  7  neighborhoods  are  collectively  referred  to  as  the
“disadvantaged area” in this study. More
than two-thirds (69%) of Boston youths live in this disadvantaged area (14). Twice as
many  residents  in  this  area  compared  with  other  city  areas  are  of  nonwhite
race/ethnicity (64% vs 32%), and a higher percentage of households with children have
incomes  below  the  poverty  level  (25%  in  the  disadvantaged  area  compared  with  an
average of 19% in other Boston neighborhoods) (14). Of the 103 eligible parks, 59 were
in the disadvantaged area. For follow-up assessment of playground quality we selected
all  parks  located  in  the  disadvantaged  area  that  had  a  baseline  playground  quality
score  lower  than  50  (n  =  19).  We  considered  playgrounds  scoring  below  50  (n  =  24
citywide)  to  be  low-scoring  playgrounds  in  need  of  repairs  or  renovations.  Of  the  19
parks selected for the subsample, 1 park was not assessed in 2007 because of ongoing
renovations, resulting in a subsample
total of 18 parks for analysis. We reviewed Parks Department capital budgets from FY
1996  through  FY  2007  to  estimate  citywide  playground  renovation  rates  among  the
park  sample.  We  obtained  annual  capital  budgets  from  the  city  of  Boston  website
(www.cityofboston.gov/budget/) and the Boston Public Library Government Documents
Department. The Parks Department schedules repair and replacement of parks on the
basis  of  these  annual  capital  budgets.  We  reviewed  projects  listed  in  the  capital
budgets and identified projects as
playground  renovations  if  1)  the  project  description  included  the  term  “playground,”
“playlot,”  “totlot,”  or  “play  equipment”  and  2)  the  anticipated  completion  date  listed
was in that budget year (for FY 1996-FY 1998 budgets) or the project status was listed
as  “completed”  or  “in  construction”  (for  FY  1999-FY  2007  budgets).  Different  criteria
were required for budgets in FY 1996 through FY 1998 and FY 1999 through FY 2007
because  the  budget  format  changed.  After  identifying  playground  renovations,  we
calculated renovation rates for the 6-year periods before (FY 1996-FY 2001) and after
(FY  2002-FY  2007)  the  PAB  baseline  assessment.  The  renovation  rate  in  each  period
equaled the total number of parks renovated in the period divided by the total number
of  parks  in  the  sample.  We  used  6-year  rates  instead  of  annual  rates  because  some
renovation projects spanned multiple budget years. Researchers conducted a follow-up
assessment  of  parks  to  assess  improvement  in  playground  quality  from  baseline  to
follow-up. A research assistant 
(J.L.B.)  visited  a  subsample  of  parks  during  August  2007  and  assessed  playground
quality 
by using the same playground quality instrument used in the baseline assessment. This
instrument  (9,12)  includes  24  items  rating  climbing  equipment,  swings,  sandboxes,
spray  pools,  and  ease  of  supervision  of  children  in  play  areas  according  to  safety
standards of the city
of  Boston  (16),  the  US  Public  Interest  Research  Group  (17),  and  the  US  Consumer
Product  Safety  Commission  (18).  The  instrument  has  previously  demonstrated  good
inter-rater  reliability  (r  =  0.77)  and  4-month  test-retest  reliability  (r  =  0.71)  (9).
Researchers  calculated  a  playground  quality  score  for  each  park  to  indicate  the
percentage  of  playground  features  meeting  the  quality  standards.  Higher  scores
indicate  better  playground  quality.  During  the  assessment  of  playground  quality  in
August 2007, the same research assistant also assessed bicycle and pedestrian access
around the subsample of parks. The purpose of this assessment was to pilot-test a tool
for  assessing  infrastructure  features  around  parks  and  to  investigate  features
potentially  influencing  access  to  public  parks.  Using  an  instrument  adapted  from
existing  tools  (19-21),  we  observed  features  of  streets,  sidewalks,  intersections,  and
marked crosswalks on street
blocks  containing  park  entrances.  Community  partners  in  city  parks  departments,
public health agencies, and pedestrian advocacy organizations informed development
of this instrument. We averaged compliance with each item assessed in each park to
assign parks a score from 0 to 100 for that item. For example, a score of 50 for good
sidewalk condition might indicate that 2 of 4 sidewalk lengths assessed were in good
condition. Researchers calculated a total bicycle and pedestrian access score for
each park to indicate the percentage of items assessed that met recommendations for
promoting safe, active park access. Higher scores indicate better local environments.
We  used  the  McNemar  test  to  compare  overall  renovation  rates  before  and  after
baseline among the parks sampled and 
χ2 analysis for comparison by city area and by playground quality score for those parks
not  renovated  at  baseline.  Among  the  latter,  we  used  logistic  regression  analysis  to
calculate  odds  ratios  to  compare  renovation  rates  after  baseline  by  city  area,
controlling for baseline playground quality score. All analyses were conducted with SAS
version 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Significance was set at P < .05. We performed a
new analysis of baseline playground quality scores to calculate the mean score in the
follow-up park sample and to compare scores by city area using a t test. We performed
a  paired  t  test  to  compare  the  mean  difference  in  scores  between  baseline  and
follow-up  of  parks  in  the  subsample  that  were  assessed  for  playground  quality  at
follow-up.  We  calculated  the  percentage  of  parks  meeting  standards  for  each  bicycle
and pedestrian access item and the mean total score among the subsample of parks.
Back  to  top  Parks  Department  capital  budgets  documented  that  62  of  the  103  Parks
Department-operated  playgrounds  assessed  in  the  PAB  baseline  assessment  were
renovated in the 12-year period from FY 1996 through FY 2007 
(Table  1).  Three  playgrounds  were  renovated  both  before  and  after  PAB  baseline.
Citywide,  playground  renovation  rates  before  (29%)  and  after  (34%)  PAB  baseline
assessment and dissemination activities were similar
(P = .34). Compared with parks in other city areas, parks in the disadvantaged
area  tended  to  be  renovated  at  a  slightly  lower  rate  before  baseline.  After  baseline,
39% of parks in the disadvantaged area were renovated, compared with 27% in other
city areas 
(P = .21). 
Among the 73 parks not renovated before baseline, parks scoring low at baseline 
were renovated after baseline at a higher rate compared with parks scoring 
higher  at  baseline  (odds  ratio,  8.16;95%  CI,  2.55-26.16;  P  <  .001).  Controlling  for
baseline score, parks in the disadvantaged 
area that were not renovated before baseline were renovated after baseline at a 
rate similar to that of other city areas (P = .97). Parks in the disadvantaged area had
lower  overall  baseline  playground  quality  scores  compared  with  parks  in  other  city
areas (P < .001) 
(Table 2). In the subsample 
of parks assessed at follow-up, average playground quality scores improved 
between the baseline (38.3) and follow-up (64.6) assessments (mean difference, 
26.3;  95%  CI,  17.8-34.7;  P  <  .001).  At  follow-up,  most  of  these  playgrounds  were
constructed with safety features to prevent injury from falling, tripping, and
entrapment  and  to  allow  for  adult  supervision  of  children  using  equipment.  Some
playground quality measures, such as appropriate safety surfacing and lack of debris
under  equipment,  broken  or  missing  parts,  or  peeling  or  chipping  paint,  continued  to
have low compliance 
with the standards assessed. According to Parks Department capital budgets, 2 of the
18 parks were renovated from FY 1996 to FY 2001, 13 from FY 2002 to FY 2007, and 3
were  not  renovated  during  this  period.  Bicycle  and  pedestrian  access  scores  suggest
that,  on  average,  these  parks  met  standards  for  approximately  half  of  the  items
assessed (mean, 52.3; 95% 
confidence interval, 47.7-56.9) 
(Table  3).  Parks  frequently  had  well-lit  entrances  and  were  surrounded  by  sidewalks
that  were  sufficiently  wide.  Marked  crosswalks  on  street  blocks  containing  park
entrances  were  often  visible,  and  pedestrian  signals  at  marked  crosswalks  always
provided adequate crossing time. On the other hand, neither bicycle racks nor bicycle
lanes  (ie,  special  lanes  marked  on  the  street  for  cyclists)  were  present  on  any  street
blocks containing park entrances. Only 29% of street blocks assessed had speed limits
below 30 mph. Intersections defining blocks containing park entrances rarely employed
traffic-calming measures such as speed humps, curb extensions, or other engineering
features designed to slow oncoming traffic and improve pedestrian safety. Few of the
available marked crosswalks were marked with pedestrian-related signage
to  identify  pedestrian  crossing  locations  for  drivers,  and  no  sidewalks  leading  into
marked  crosswalks  had  detectable  warnings  underfoot  to  alert  pedestrians  to  the
crossing  transition.  Back  to  top  In  previous  findings  from  the  2000  to  2001  baseline
assessment, neighborhoods with lower playground quality scores also tended to have
fewer playgrounds in proportion to youth population (9), suggesting that playgrounds in
these  neighborhoods  may  experience  more  wear  and  require  more  frequent
maintenance.  Between  2000  to  2001  and  2007,  PAB  staff  met  with  Boston  residents
and with the Boston mayor’s office and the Parks Department to share a complete list
of observed playground quality
scores,  and  released  a  report  summarizing  key  findings  (12,13).  The  results  of  our
follow-up  assessment  suggest  that  the  Parks  Department  renovation  schedule  has
equitably addressed playgrounds according to need and that the quality of playgrounds
studied  improved  between  2000  to  2001  and  2007.  In  this  study,  we  observed  lower
playground  quality  at  baseline  among  city  playgrounds  in  a  disadvantaged  area
compared
with  other  city  areas.  Our  finding  that  before  baseline  playground  assessment,
playgrounds in the disadvantaged area were renovated at a rate similar to that of other
city areas, suggests that differences in baseline playground quality across areas may
be due to differences in use and maintenance rather than construction. We found that
among parks that had not been renovated before baseline, those identified as in need
of renovation based on low playground quality scores were renovated at a
significantly higher rate than those with higher quality scores. Furthermore, accounting
for  baseline  quality,  playgrounds  were  replaced  according  to  need  in  both
disadvantaged  and  other  city  areas  after  the  initial  playground  assessment.  Results
from the follow-up observational assessment corroborate findings regarding playground
renovations. Many of the playground quality items that improved between the baseline
and  follow-up  assessments  were  related  to  playground  equipment  construction,
suggesting that newer installations are meeting more stringent safety standards. The
playground quality items that continued to have low compliance were largely related to
maintenance issues, such as upkeep of safety surfacing and attention
to broken or missing equipment. Findings regarding bicycle and pedestrian access offer
a  starting  point  for  further  dialogue  and  collaboration  to  provide  and  improve  local
bicycle and pedestrian access to these playgrounds and parks, which are destinations
for  children  and  adults  alike.  Overall,  pedestrian  access  appeared  better  than  bicycle
access  around  the  parks  assessed.  Road  lighting  and  sidewalks,  basic  infrastructure
associated with reductions in pedestrian injuries (10), were found surrounding nearly all
parks.
However,  other  features  that  can  increase  pedestrian  safety,  such  as  traffic  calming
measures (22), could be improved. Cheaper and simpler strategies, such as installing
pedestrian-related signage to identify pedestrian crossings for drivers, are feasible first
steps toward improving the infrastructure. The addition of bicycle racks in and around
parks  will  make  cycling  to  these  destinations  more  attractive.  In  2007,  the  Boston
Mayor’s Office began several citywide initiatives promoting
bicycling  and  has  added  1,500  bicycle  parking  spaces  and  33  miles  of  bicycle  lanes
throughout Boston neighborhoods since our assessment (23). Several limitations to this
study should be noted. The study was conducted in 1 city 
by  using  an  observational  design  without  a  comparison  community.  Therefore,  we
cannot  account  for  natural  history,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  overall  economic
climate and the lifespan of playgrounds. We did not know the age of each playground at
baseline,  which  would  likely  influence  observed  playground  quality  and  renovation
scheduling, because we lacked detailed capital budget data before FY 1996.
Analyses  of  playground  renovations  after  baseline  were  limited  by  small  sample  size
and  produced  wide  confidence  intervals;  point  estimates  should  be  interpreted  with
caution. The measure used to determine playground renovation rates was not assessed
for  reliability  or  validity.  We  lacked  detailed  project  descriptions  and  did  not  confirm
project  construction  dates  through  discussion  with  city  officials  or  through  direct
observation, except among the subsample of parks observed. We also did not
examine  other  funding  sources  for  playground  renovations,  which  could  vary  by  park
location.  Future  studies  could  compare  playground  renovation  history  across
communities, validate the method for identifying playground renovations by using city 
Parks  Department  capital  budgets,  and  investigate  other  sources  of  park  renovation
funding. For observational assessments, results are representative only of playgrounds
in  the  disadvantaged  area  that  had  low  observed  playground  quality  at  baseline.
Because  of  resource  limitations,  we  were  not  able  to  observe  playground  quality  or
bicycle and pedestrian access citywide or make comparisons by city area or baseline
quality with sufficient power. A comprehensive assessment of all Boston playgrounds is
needed to describe citywide changes in playground quality. In the playground quality
instrument used, items contribute equally to the playground score, so the same score
for  2  different  parks  or  for  the  same  park  at  baseline  and  follow-up  may  not  reflect
equivalent injury hazard. At follow-up, 1 researcher 
(J.L.B.)  completed  all  playground  quality  assessments,  whereas  at  baseline  5
researchers 
(including  C.H.  and  A.L.C.)  assessed  quality.  However,  1  researcher  (A.L.C.)  assessed
64% of parks at baseline, and the instrument demonstrated good interrater reliability (r
= 0.77) (9). The bicycle and pedestrian access
instrument was not tested for reliability or validity. Also, bicycle and pedestrian access
scores  do  not  account  for  parent  or  child  perceptions  of  the  environment,  potentially
significant  factors  affecting  decisions  about  active  transportation  (5).  Future  studies
could assess validity of the bicycle and pedestrian access instrument and investigate
transportation infrastructure on a larger scale and across a larger geographic area. One
of  many  ways  to  promote  physical  activity  and  health  among  children  and  youths  is
through
 provision
 of
 accessible,
 quality
 recreational
 infrastructure,
 including
playgrounds.  In  this  study,  data  from  Parks  Department  capital  budgets  indicate  an
equitable  rate  of  playground  renovation  across  city  areas  according  to  need,  as
observed and communicated through the PAB community-based research project. Back
