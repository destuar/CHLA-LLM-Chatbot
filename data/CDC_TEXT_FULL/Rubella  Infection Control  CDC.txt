Healthcare  Personnel:  Epidemiology  and  Control  of  Selected  Infections  Transmitted
Among  Healthcare  Personnel  and  Patients  (2024)  guideline.  Recommendations  For
recommendations  about  healthcare  personnel  who  are  pregnant  or  intending  to
become  pregnant,  please  see  the  Pregnant  HCP  section.  Rubella  (German  Measles,
Three-Day  Measles)  is  a  viral  rash  illness  that  is  typically  mild,  but  that  can  lead  to
complications  and  death1.  Although  endemic  in  many  countries  in  the  world,  rubella
was  declared  eliminated  in  the  US  in  2004.2  The  US  elimination  of  rubella  was
reconfirmed  in  2011,  and  maintenance  of  elimination  was  reported  in  2014.34  No
documented  transmission  of  rubella  to  healthcare  personnel  (HCP)  or  others  in  US
healthcare  facilities  has  occurred  since  elimination  was  declared;  however,  imported
cases of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) have been reported, and HCP
exposures  have  occurred.5  Rubella  transmission  in  US  medical  settings  was
documented extensively in the decades before elimination, with serious consequences,
including  pregnancy  terminations,  disruption  of  hospital  routine,  absenteeism  from
work,  and  expensive  containment  measures.67891011121314151617  Prevention  of
transmission of the rubella virus in healthcare settings involves (a) ensuring healthcare
personnel  have  presumptive  evidence  of  immunity18;  (b)  using  infection  prevention
and
 control
 practices
 as
 recommended
 by
 CDC
(https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/appendix/type-durationprecau
tions.html#R)19;  and  (c)  excluding  potentially  infectious  HCP  from  work.220
Recommendations  for  rubella  vaccination  of  HCP  are  maintained  by  CDC  and  ACIP
(https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vaccspecific/mmr.html).21 Transmission of
rubella  occurs  through  deposition  of  respiratory,  oral,  or  nasal  secretions  from  an
infected source person on the mucus membranes of a susceptible host. An exposure to
rubella  is  generally  defined  as  being  within  close  proximity  of  an  infectious  source
person  (e.g.,  within  approximately  6  feet  of  the  patient)  while  unprotected  (i.e.,  not
wearing  recommended  personal  protective  equipment)  or  having  mucous  membrane
contact with their secretions.2 The risk of virus transmission may increase depending
on  a  number  of  factors  (e.g.,  decreased  room  ventilation,  increased  exposure  time,
closer  proximity  to  an  infectious  source  person).  Rubella  is  characterized  by  a  mild,
maculopapular rash; lymphadenopathy; and fever.1 The rash occurs in 50% to 80% of
infected people and usually starts on the face, becomes generalized within 24 hours,
and lasts a median of 3 days.1 Many rubella infections are not recognized because the
rash resembles other rash illnesses.1 When rubella infection occurs during pregnancy,
especially during the first trimester, congenital infection and serious consequences can
result,  including  miscarriages,  stillbirths  and  fetal  deaths,  and  severe  birth  defects.2
Additional complications of rubella include arthralgia or arthritis, which may occur in up
to  70%  of  adult  women  with  rubella,  and  rarely  thrombocytopenic  purpura  and
encephalitis.1 The average incubation period of rubella virus is 17 days, with a range of
12 to 23 days.1 Persons with rubella are most infectious when the rash is erupting, but
they  can  shed  virus  from  7  days  before  to  7  days  after  rash  onset.12  Certain
populations  infected  with  rubella,  such  as  infants  with  Congenital  Rubella  Syndrome,
may excrete virus for prolonged periods, which may extend their infectious period.522
Approximately 25% - 50% of rubella infections are asymptomatic.1 Clinical diagnosis of
rubella  is  unreliable;  therefore,  cases  are  laboratory  confirmed.2  Options  for  rubella
testing include detection of the virus by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), the presence
of rubella-specific IgM antibody, or demonstration of a significant rise in IgG antibody
from  paired  acute-  and  convalescent-phase  sera.22  Virus  detection  and  serologic
testing  can  be  used  to  confirm  acute  or  recent  rubella  infection.2  Information  on
laboratory
 testing
 for
 rubella
 is
 available
 on
 the
 CDC
 website
(https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/lab/index.html).23  No  evidence  exists  that  postexposure
vaccination  is  effective  in  preventing  rubella  infection622.  and  PEP  after  exposure  to
rubella  is  not  typically  offered.  Due  to  the  lack  of  evidence,  even  if  HCP  receive
postexposure  vaccination,  they  are  still  excluded  from  work  as  is  recommended  for
those without presumptive evidence of immunity to rubella.  CDC provides information
on  infection  control  and  clinical  safety  to  help  reduce  the  risk  of  infections  among
healthcare workers, patients, and visitors. Languages Language Assistance Languages
