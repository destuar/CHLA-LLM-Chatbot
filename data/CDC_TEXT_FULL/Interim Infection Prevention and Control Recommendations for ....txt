on  preventing  and  controlling  measles  in  healthcare  settings.  Measles  is  most
commonly  acquired  from  persons  in  the  household  or  community,  but  spread  of
measles can also occur in healthcare settings.1 While the most important measure to
prevent measles transmission in all settings is ensuring community immunization, core
measles prevention in healthcare settings requires a multi-faceted approach including:
This  interim  guidance  should  be  implemented  in  the  context  of  a  comprehensive
infection  prevention  program  to  prevent  transmission  of  all  infectious  agents  among
patients, HCP, and visitors. Definition of healthcare personnel (HCP): "HCP" includes all
paid  and  unpaid  persons  working  in  healthcare  settings  who  have  the  potential  for
exposure  to  patients  and/or  to  infectious  materials,  including  body  substances,
contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces,
or  contaminated  air.  HCP  include  but  are  not  limited  to,  emergency  medical  service
personnel,
 nurses,
 nursing
 assistants,
 physicians,
 technicians,
 therapists,
phlebotomists, pharmacists, students and trainees, contractual staff not employed by
the healthcare facility, and persons not directly involved in patient care, but who could
be exposed to infectious agents that can be transmitted in the healthcare setting (e.g.,
clerical,  dietary,  environmental  services,  laundry,  security,  engineering  and  facilities
management, administrative, billing, and volunteer personnel). Definition of healthcare
settings:  "Healthcare  settings"  refers  to  places  where  healthcare  is  delivered  and
includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  acute  care  facilities,  long-term  acute  care  facilities,
inpatient  rehabilitation  facilities,  nursing  homes  and  assisted  living  facilities,  home
healthcare, vehicles where healthcare is delivered (e.g., mobile clinics), and outpatient
facilities, such as dialysis centers, physician offices, and others. Definition of exposure
to measles for HCP in healthcare settings: HCP exposures to measles in a healthcare
setting  include  spending  any  time  while  unprotected  (i.e.,  not  wearing  recommended
respiratory protection): * Measles has been reported to survive in air for up to 2 hours.
For  spaces  with  a  defined  rate  of  air  changes  per  hour  (ACH),  see  the  following  for
additional  considerations  about  estimating  the  time  for  99.9%  removal  efficiency  of
airborne  contaminants:  Table  B1  "Air  changes/hour  (ACH)  and  time  required  for
airborne-contaminant
 removal

 efficiency"
