and the title of the report in the subject line of e-mail. In 2009, the largest single-year
percentage  decrease  in  tuberculosis  (TB)  cases  was  reported  since  national  TB
surveillance began in the United States in 1953. Overall, TB rates decreased 11.4% to
3.8 cases per 100,000 population, compared with an average annual decline of 3.8%
each year since 2000 (1,2). Georgia and Pennsylvania were among 36 states reporting
decreases from 2008; TB case rates fell 14.3% (from 4.9 to 4.2) in Georgia and 38.7%
(from  3.1  to  1.9)  in  Pennsylvania.  Concerned  about  the  possibility  of  unidentified  TB
cases,  the  Georgia  Division  of  Public  Health  and  the  Pennsylvania  Department  of
Health,  in  collaboration  with  CDC,  conducted  investigations  centering  on  four
hypotheses
 for
 the
 declines:
 1)
 surveillance
 artifact,
 2)
 underreporting,
 3)
underdiagnosis,  and  4)  actual  decline.  This  report  summarizes  the  results  of  those
investigations,  which  found  no  evidence  of  surveillance  artifact,  underreporting,  or
underdiagnosis  substantial  enough  to  account  for  the  magnitude  of  the  declines.
Instead, a decrease in the number of laboratory-confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis
complex diagnoses and a decrease in the percentage of suspected TB cases ultimately
counted as meeting the TB case definition; both suggested a true decline in TB in 2009.
The population groups with the largest declines were foreign-born persons and children.
Continued TB surveillance, including vigilance in suspecting, diagnosing, and reporting
TB  cases  to  public  health  departments,  will  help  clarify  the  cause  of  this  decline  and
determine  long-term  TB  trends  in  the  United  States.   The  investigations  in  the  two
states were conducted during March--May 2010 and included systematically assessing
changes  in  TB  surveillance  practices,  cross-matching  health  department  data  with
records  from  reporting  entities  and  secondary  sources,  reviewing  laboratory  records,
and analyzing state TB registries for epidemiologic changes. Reports of suspected TB
cases  sent  by  health-care  providers  and  laboratories  to  public  health  departments  in
Georgia and Pennsylvania are entered into Georgia's State Electronic Notifiable Disease
Surveillance  System  (SENDSS)  and  Pennsylvania's  version  of  the  National  Electronic
Disease  Surveillance  System  (PA-NEDSS).  In  Pennsylvania,  electronic  reports  also  are
downloaded automatically from laboratory databases into PA-NEDSS. Once a report is
investigated locally, designated health department officials determine whether it meets
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists criteria to be counted as a case.*  To
assess for surveillance artifact (i.e., whether case counts were artificially low as a result
of  changes  or  delays  in  reporting,  investigating,  or  counting,  including  changes  in
criteria  for  counting  reports  as  cases)  in  2009,  public  health  staff  members  in  both
states  were  interviewed,  and  trend  analyses  of  SENDSS  and  PA-NEDSS  data  were
conducted. The number of suspected TB case reports, the proportion of those reports
ultimately  counted  as  cases,  and  selected  surveillance  quality  measures  (e.g.,  mean
time  from  initial  report  to  count  inclusion)  were  evaluated  for  2008--2009  in  Georgia
and  2007--2009  in  Pennsylvania  (where  2007  was  the  comparison  year  because
delayed counting of cases first reported in 2005--2007 was known to have inflated the
2008  case  count  artificially).  In  Georgia,  officials  in  the  13  counties  with  declines  of
three  or  more  reported  cases  provided  their  independent  case  counts  to  determine
concordance with SENDSS. In addition, paper reports not yet entered into SENDSS were
reviewed  to  identify  additional  cases.  Similarly,  suspected  TB  reports  included  in
PA-NEDSS that had not been counted as cases were reexamined if they had laboratory
or clinical characteristics suggestive of TB.  To assess for underreporting, SENDSS and
PA-NEDSS records were cross-matched with line lists from different sources of patients
with  potential  TB  diagnoses  in  2008  and  2009.  Both  state  public  health  laboratories
participated, as did the City of Philadelphia public health laboratory and 43 (46%) of 92
licensed  private  laboratories  in  Georgia  and  131  (81%)  of  161  in  Pennsylvania  that
provided these data as part of a survey. Additional cross-matching in Georgia included
infection-control records from the 13 Atlanta hospitals that reported the most cases of
TB. Records of patients with a TB-related code from the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9)† in the state's hospital discharge database, but not in
SENDSS  (i.e.,  unmatched  patients),  also  were  assessed  further.   To  assess  for
underdiagnosis,  the  public  health  laboratories  serving  the  two  states  ran  systematic
queries on the total number of patients who had specimens tested for M. tuberculosis
complex (e.g., M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, or M. africanum) by culture or by nucleic acid
amplification  testing  and  the  proportion  with  M.  tuberculosis  complex  confirmed  by
either test. Investigators also assessed whether any changes in laboratory policies or
practices  might  account  for  the  unexpected  drop  in  reported  TB.  Similar  data  were
gathered via a survey sent to licensed private laboratories in the two states. In Georgia,
57 (62%) of 92 private laboratories responded with these data, as did 131 (81%) of 161
in  Pennsylvania.  Nonresponding  laboratories  in  Pennsylvania  did  not  have  fewer
PA-NEDSS reports in 2009 compared with 2008; in Georgia, such changes could not be
assessed. In addition, TB diagnosis trends in the hospital discharge records provided by
the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council for Southeastern Pennsylvania,
which  covers  approximately  40%  of  the  state's  population  (3),  were  examined;  ICD-9
codes  were  used  to  identify  possible  TB-related  hospitalizations.   To  assess  the
evidence  supporting  an  actual  decline  in  TB,  Georgia  and  Pennsylvania  TB  cases
counted in 2009 were compared with 2008 cases for changes in patient characteristics
that could affect the likelihood of having laboratory-confirmed TB (e.g., age and site of
disease). Linear regression of log-transformed case counts during 1999--2009 was used
to  determine  the  expected  numbers  of  cases  among  U.S.-born  and  foreign-born
persons;  observed  numbers  outside  the  95%  prediction  interval  were  considered
significant.  Investigation  of  Surveillance  Artifact  No  changes  or  delays  in  surveillance
practices were found in Georgia. Excluding results of overseas TB screening in newly
arriving  immigrants,  the  number  of  suspected  TB  reports  in  2008  was  comparable  to
that in 2009. The mean numbers of days between initial report, entry into SENDSS, and
inclusion in the state case count also were comparable. However, despite no changes in
the  criteria  for  counting  suspected  TB  as  cases,  the  percentage  of  initial  reports
ultimately counted as cases declined, from 77% (478 of 623) in 2008 to 66% (415 of
619) in 2009. The independent counts in the 13 counties with the largest declines were
concordant with SENDSS data; one uncounted TB case was found among paper reports
not yet entered into SENDSS.  Similarly, surveillance practices in Pennsylvania did not
appear to change substantially in 2009. Delayed counting of cases first reported during
2005--2007 is known to have artificially inflated the 2008 case count in Pennsylvania.
One  suspected  TB  report  from  2005,  three  from  2006,  and  48  from  2007  were  not
counted  as cases until  2008 (Figure 1).  However,  even  after adjusting  Pennsylvania's
2008 case count for this known surveillance artifact (i.e., subtracting 52 cases), a 30%
annual decline was still observed in 2009, and the number of suspected TB reports to
public  health  authorities  remained  stable.  The  mean  number  of  days  between  initial
report  and  investigation  was  comparable  during  2007--2009.  However,  as  in  Georgia,
the percentage of initial reports ultimately counted as TB cases declined from 14% (276
of 1,995) in 2007 to 12% (236 of 2,030) in 2009. (Pennsylvania has a larger number of
suspected  TB  reports,  compared  with  Georgia,  because  of  automatic  downloads  from
laboratory databases into PA-NEDSS.) Among the suspected TB reports not counted as
cases in Pennsylvania in 2009, a total of 409 met the criteria for further investigation,
but  only  six  were  determined  to  be  verified  and  countable.  Investigation  of
Underreporting  In  Georgia,  the  SENDSS  cross-match  with  line  lists  of  patients  with
positive TB results from the state public health laboratory, 43 private laboratories, and
13 hospitals detected no unreported cases. Among patients with TB ICD-9 codes in the
hospital discharge database, 45% (244 of 539) in 2008 and 43% (178 of 416) in 2009
(fourth quarter data unavailable) were not found in SENDSS. Seventy-three of these 422
unmatched patients were selected for further review based on having ICD-9 codes that
corresponded  to  countable  TB  for  >50%  of  hospital  records.§  Further  medical  review
was possible for 28 (85%) of 33 unmatched records in 2008 and for 37 (93%) of 40 in
2009.  One  unreported  2009  case  (culture-negative  TB  pleurisy)  was  found.   In
Pennsylvania,  the  PA-NEDSS  cross-match  with  line  lists  of  patients  with  positive  M.
tuberculosis  complex  results  from  public  health  laboratories  and  from  58  private
laboratories  found  13  potentially  unreported  cases,  of  which  none  proved  to  be
countable  (seven  were  in  non-Pennsylvania  residents,  and  six  were  nontuberculous
mycobacteria).  Investigation  of  Underdiagnosis  Review  of  2008  and  2009  laboratory
data in both states showed that the total number of patients who had specimens tested
for mycobacteria increased in the public health laboratories (i.e., 4.7% in Georgia and
11.6%  in  Pennsylvania),  but  the  proportion  of  patients  with  specimens  that  tested
positive  for  M.  tuberculosis  complex  decreased  19.8%  in  the  Georgia  State  Public
Health Laboratory and 28.8% in Pennsylvania public health laboratories (Table). In the
10 private laboratories that provided these data in response to the Georgia survey, a
parallel  decline  was  noted.  Among  131  private  laboratories  responding  to  the
Pennsylvania survey, similar numbers of specimens were received for M. tuberculosis
complex testing annually during 2007--2009, but the proportion that tested positive for
M. tuberculosis complex decreased 36% from 2008 to 2009 (Figure 2). In neither state
were  changes  noted  in  the  types  of  specimens  processed  or  in  the  methods  or
procedures  (at  public  health  labs)  for  laboratory  diagnosis  of  TB.   Analysis  of  the
southeastern Pennsylvania hospital discharge dataset showed that the total number of
inpatient hospitalizations was stable, with 707,601; 699,893; and 696,846 discharges in
2007, 2008, and 2009, respectively. Time-trend analysis revealed that the percentage
of  all  hospitalizations  with  either  pulmonary  or  extrapulmonary  TB  as  a  primary  or
secondary  diagnosis  was  approximately  0.04%  each  year;  further  subset  analyses  by
TB-related  ICD-9  codes  revealed  no  other  TB  diagnosis-related  changes  during  this
period.   Evidence  Suggesting  Actual  Declines  in  TB  Because  the  investigations  in
Georgia and Pennsylvania found little evidence to support the first three hypotheses for
the  decline  in  reported  TB  cases,  more  consideration  was  given  to  whether  the
surveillance findings represented an actual decline in 2009. The relative proportions of
counted  TB  cases  that  met  the  national  case  definition  based  on  laboratory  criteria
essentially were unchanged: from 362 (76%) of Georgia's 478 TB cases in 2008 to 303
(73%) of 415 in 2009, and from 214 (78%) of Pennsylvania's 276 TB cases in 2007 to
190 (81%) of 236 in 2009. In both states, the declines noted from 2008 to 2009 by site
of  disease  appeared  approximately  consistent  (i.e.,  a  15%  decline  in  pulmonary  and
13% decline in extrapulmonary in Georgia, with declines of 36% and 45%, respectively,
in Pennsylvania). Also in both states, children aged <15 years were the age group that
experienced the largest decrease in reported TB cases (by 38% in Georgia and 79% in
Pennsylvania) in 2009. Linear regression analysis of cases during 1999--2009 showed
that  observed  case  counts  among  foreign  born-persons  declined  significantly  in  both
states in 2009. Based on the prediction interval for the number of TB cases reported
among  foreign-born  persons,  Georgia  would  have  expected  182--247,  but  observed
176; Pennsylvania would have expected 131--239, but observed 127. Among U.S.-born
persons,  smaller  declines  were  not  statistically  significant.  For  U.S.-born  persons,  the
235 observed cases were within the 201--295 prediction interval in Georgia, and 108
observed  cases  were  within  the  94--197  prediction  interval  in  Pennsylvania.   K  Viner,

Abraham, MD, EIS officers, CDC. After unexpected declines in 2009 in the number of TB
cases reported in Georgia and Pennsylvania, investigations in the two states applied an
extensive  systematic  approach  to  assess  whether  the  declines  were  actual.  Although
the investigations did not reexamine every initial report of suspected TB to determine
whether it was or was not counted properly, hundreds of such reports and thousands of
statewide hospital and laboratory records were reexamined, ultimately finding only two
uncounted cases in Georgia and six in Pennsylvania that should have been counted in
2009;  of  these  eight  cases,  all  except  one  Georgia  case  had  been  reported  to  public
health  authorities  but  not  recorded  in  the  surveillance  system.  The  results  of  these
investigations  provide  strong  evidence  against  underreporting  as  the  cause  for  the
decline.  The  results  are  similar  to  those  of  a  previous  study  of  TB  case-reporting
completeness  in  seven  U.S.  states  during  1994--1995,  which  found  few  unreported
cases  (4).  The  investigations  determined  that,  whereas  the  number  of  positive  TB
results  declined,  the  total  number  of  individual  patients  and  specimens  tested  for  TB
remained stable or increased in the public health laboratories serving the two states. A
similar  trend  in  the  states'  private  laboratories  also  suggested  that  the  decline  in  TB
diagnoses  in  Georgia  and  Pennsylvania  was  not  the  consequence  of  health-care
providers'  failing  to  consider  a  diagnosis  of  TB  in  2009.  Pennsylvania's  stable
percentage  of  hospitalizations  with  TB-related  diagnoses  during  2007--2009  provides
further  evidence  against  underdiagnosis  and  might  suggest  a  decline  in  less  severe
manifestations  of  TB  disease  that  do  not  require  hospitalization.   The  findings  in  this
report  are  subject  to  at  least  three  limitations.  First,  this  investigation  could  not
examine  whether  underdiagnosis  occurred  because  of  failure  of  patients  to  seek
medical  attention  for  TB  symptoms.  For  example,  factors  affecting  patient  access  to
medical  care,  such  as  immigration  status  or  financial  constraints,  were  not  assessed
(5).  Second,  neither  state  assessed  underdiagnosis  or  underreporting  at  outpatient
provider  sites  where  patients  with  less  severe  disease  might  have  been  managed.
Finally, one of the methods used to assess whether hospitals might have underreported
TB  cases  relied  on  how  well  ICD-9  codes  corresponded  to  known  TB  cases  without
medical record reviews to test the validity of the ICD-9 code itself.  The findings in both
Georgia and Pennsylvania of a decrease in the percentage of suspected TB reports that
ultimately were counted as cases and a decrease in the proportion of tested specimens
yielding  M.  tuberculosis  complex  support  an  actual  decline  in  incident  TB  disease  in
2009. The decreased proportion of laboratory-confirmed TB cannot be explained by a
commensurate increase in the types of cases typically associated with culture-negative
TB (e.g., pediatric or extrapulmonary TB [6,7]). Children experienced the largest decline
in  reported  TB,  a  finding  suggesting  either  less  TB  transmission  or  changes  in
immigration  patterns.  Similarly,  the  decline  in  TB  cases  among  foreign-born  persons
might reflect an actual decline because of changes in migration following the economic
downturn  (i.e.,  decreased  immigration  or  increased  emigration  of  job-seekers)  or
improved  preimmigration  TB  detection  and  treatment  among  U.S.-bound  immigrants
per CDC's technical instructions for prevention and treatment of TB among immigrants
(8).  Varying  implementation  dates  and  the  small  number  of  cases  in  Georgia  and
Pennsylvania from countries that have implemented the revised instructions prevented
an  assessment  of  the  impact  of  these  overseas  screening  changes.   Although  recent
changes  in  migration  patterns  or  in  overseas  TB  screening  of  new  immigrants  are
possible  explanations  for  an  actual  U.S.  decline  in  TB  in  2009,  clinicians  and  health
systems should maintain vigilance for TB and promptly report new TB cases to public
health authorities. A decline because of delayed diagnosis resulting from obstacles to
care also remains a possibility, although preliminary 2010 TB surveillance data did not
demonstrate  a  compensatory  increase  in  the  number  of  cases  (9).  Monitoring  for
patients  with  more  advanced  disease  is  important  to  prevent  worse  morbidity  and
increased mortality from TB. Continued analyses of new public health surveillance and
other  data  sources  will  help  to  better  discern  long-term  trends  in  TB  in  the  United
States.   This  report  is  based,  in  part,  on  contributions  by  A  Chakragiri,  S  Daniel,  K
Buford, Georgia Div of Public Health; J Bush, Georgia Dept of Community Health; and T

ICD-9  codes  (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd/icd9.htm)  for  TB  are  010--019;  code  011  is
specific for pulmonary TB disease. § Georgia investigators estimated which ICD-9 codes
corresponded to countable TB on the basis of the counted 2008--2009 TB cases (i.e.,
known to have TB) in SENDSS. First, they recorded the frequency of all the TB-related
ICD-9  codes  that  appeared  in  hospital  discharge  records.  For  each  ICD-9  code  with  a
frequency  greater  than  three,  the  numerator  for  the  estimate  was  the  number  of
hospital records with that ICD-9 code that also matched a counted TB case in SENDSS,
and  the  denominator  was  the  total  number  of  records  with  that  ICD-9  code.  The
discharge  diagnosis  codes  estimated  to  correspond  to  countable  TB  for  >50%  of
records  were  011.2,  011.23,  011.24,  011.26,  011.6,  011.63,  011.64,  011.66,  011.91,
011.92,  011.93,  011.94,  011.96,  012.0,  012.04,  013.0,  013.04,  015.53,  017.2,  and
018.9.  What is already known on this topic? In 2009, tuberculosis (TB) incidence in the
United States decreased to 3.8 cases per 100,000 population, the lowest recorded rate
since national TB surveillance began in 1953. The 11.4% decrease from 2008 was the
greatest  single-year  decrease  ever  recorded.  What  is  added  by  this  report?  Findings
from  systematic  investigations  in  Georgia  and  Pennsylvania,  two  states  that
experienced  unexpectedly  large  decreases  in  TB  incidence  in  2009,  indicate  that  the
decline  in  new  TB  disease  in  those  states  appeared  actual  and  not  attributable  to
surveillance artifact, health-care provider underdiagnosis, or underreporting.  What are
the implications for public health practice? The TB surveillance systems in Georgia and
Pennsylvania appear to be functioning appropriately. Current efforts to diagnose, treat,
and report TB cases should be vigorously maintained as the United States moves closer
to the goal of TB elimination. FIGURE 1. Counted cases of tuberculosis --- Georgia and
