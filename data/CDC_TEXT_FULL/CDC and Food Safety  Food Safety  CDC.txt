 CDC helps make food safer by: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is charged
with implementing most of the laws, rules and guidance that are part of the Food Safety
Modernization Act (FSMA), but CDC plays a key role. The act, signed into law in 2011,
seeks  to  protect  public  health  more  effectively  by  strengthening  the  food  safety
system.  FSMA  focuses  on  preventing  food  safety  problems  before  they  occur  and
recognizes  the  importance  of  strong  foodborne  illness  and  outbreak  surveillance
systems. Rapidly detecting and responding to foodborne disease outbreaks is crucial to
stop outbreaks, prevent them from happening, and ultimately decrease the burden of
foodborne illness. FSMA directs CDC to enhance foodborne illness surveillance systems
through  improved  collection,  analysis,  and  reporting  of  foodborne  illness  data.  CDC
supports  FSMA  with  four  key  activities:  Foods  we  love  and  rely  on  for  good  health
sometimes  contain  germs  that  can  make  us  sick.  These  illnesses  can  be  deadly  for
some people. More prevention efforts that focus on the foods and germs responsible for
the  most  illnesses  are  needed  to  reduce  foodborne  illness  in  the  United  States.
