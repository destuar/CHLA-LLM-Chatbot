increase  your  risk  for  heat-related  illnesses.  PPE  (e.g.,  waterproof  aprons,  surgical
gowns,  surgical  caps,  respirators,  face  shields,  boots,  and  gloves):  For  additional
information, see 3.3 Effects of Clothing on Heat Exchange in the NIOSH Criteria for a
Recommended  Standard:  Occupational  Exposure   to  Heat  and  Hot  Environments.
Wearing  certain  types  of  PPE  can  increase  core  body  temperature  (i.e.,  internal
temperature) more quickly than wearing other types of PPE in the same environment.
Yes,  wearable  PPE  that  protects  against  heat  exposures  are  called  auxiliary  cooling
systems or personal cooling systems (e.g., water-cooled garments, air-cooled garments,
cooling  vests,  and  wetted  overgarments)  and  can  range  in  simplicity,  cost,  and
maintenance. In situations, where heat stress levels exceed the NIOSH recommended
occupational  exposure  limit  (RAL  or  REL),  some  form  of  heat-protective  clothing  or
equipment should be provided. Wearable personal cooling systems could also be used
during  a  rest  period  where  the  worker  is  not  actively  engaged  in  work.  Core  body
temperature decreases relatively slowly, and simply stopping hard work will not result
in an immediate decrease. Therefore, increasing the rate of heat removal from the body
would reduce the risk for heat-related illness. Using wearable personal cooling systems
could  reduce the time required  to  lower core body  temperature.  For example,  during
rest  breaks:  This  reduces  body  core  temperature  and  allows  for  a  more  rapid
“rehabilitation”  during  the  rest  break.  Wearable  personal  cooling  systems  have
limitations within a work setting, such as: For additional information, see 6.3 Personal
