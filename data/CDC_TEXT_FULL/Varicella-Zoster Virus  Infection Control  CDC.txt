 guideline.
Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a DNA virus that is a member of the herpesvirus group.
Primary  infection  with  VZV  causes  varicella  (chickenpox),  and  reactivation  of  latent
infection causes herpes zoster (shingles). Healthcare-associated transmission of VZV is
well recognized,45 although reports of transmission in healthcare settings have become
less  common  since  the  introduction  of  the  varicella  vaccine.6789  Sources  for
healthcare-associated  transmission  include  patients,  healthcare  personnel  (HCP),  and
visitors  with  either  varicella  or  herpes  zoster.10  Prevention  of  transmission  of  VZV  in
healthcare settings involves (a) ensuring HCP have evidence of immunity to varicella11;
(b)  using  infection  prevention  and  control  practices  as  recommended  by  CDC  
(https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/isolation-precautions/appendix-a-type-durati
on.html#V)12;  (c)  administering  postexposure  prophylaxis  (PEP)  to  susceptible  HCP
exposed to varicella or herpes zoster; and (d) excluding potentially infectious HCP from
work.13 CDC recommends that susceptible HCP should not enter the room of a patient
with  varicella,  disseminated  herpes  zoster,  or  localized  herpes  zoster  if  immune
caregivers  are  available.14  The  criteria  for  evidence  of  immunity  to  varicella

CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). VZV can be spread
from  person  to  person  by  direct  contact,  inhalation  of  small  particles  from  vesicular
fluid of skin lesions of acute varicella or herpes zoster that remain suspended in the air,
and possibly through infectious respiratory secretions from patients with varicella that
also  may  be  suspended  in  the  air.16   Unprotected  (e.g.,  not  wearing  recommended
personal  protective  equipment)  contact  with  patients  with  varicella  or  disseminated
herpes  zoster,  their  secretions,  or  air  containing  infectious  particles  is  typically
considered  an  exposure  to  VZV.  Exposures  in  healthcare  settings  may  include
unprotected  entry  into  a  source  patient’s  room  (or  shared  air  space)  or  touching
vesicular fluid from skin lesions without personal protective equipment. Experts differ
regarding  the  duration  of  exposure  to  an  infectious  patient  (e.g.,  being  in  the  same
room) that is needed for transmission. Sources suggest time frames from 5 minutes to
up  to  1  hour.3  Using  a  shorter  time  frame  (e.g.,  5  minutes)  for  considering  an
unprotected  HCP  to  be  exposed,  might  better  ensure  that  HCP  at  risk  for  developing
disease are identified. Brief, unprotected entry into a source patient’s room (or shared
air  space)  without  touching  the  patient  or  surfaces  is  generally  not  considered  an
exposure.  VZV  can  also  spread  from  a  person  with  active  localized  herpes  zoster  to
cause  varicella  in  a  susceptible  person  (i.e.,  who  has  never  had  varicella  or  has  not
received varicella vaccine).17 The lesions of localized (or disseminated) herpes zoster
are  infectious  until  they  dry  and  crust  over;  covering  the  lesions  reduces  the  risk  of
transmission to others. For HCP with localized herpes zoster, covering lesions serves the
two-fold purpose of reducing the risk of transmission to others, as well as protecting the
compromised skin from contamination and potential secondary infection. Data on the
efficacy  of  one  type  of  covering  (e.g.,  sterile  bandage,  gauze,  clothing,  etc.)  versus
another for preventing virus transmission are limited.1819 Some facilities have policies
regarding what types of dressings may be used to cover lesions for HCP with localized
herpes zoster to report to work. Varicella, or chickenpox, is the acute, infectious febrile
rash illness that results from primary infection with VZV.2021 After primary infection,
VZV establishes latency in the sensory nerve ganglia. Herpes zoster, or shingles, is the
reactivation of latent VZV and occurs in approximately one-third of those infected over
their  lifetime.  The  incubation  period  for  varicella  is  on  average  14  to  16  days  after
exposure  to  a  varicella  or  a  herpes  zoster  rash,  with  a  range  of  10  to  21  days.22  A
person with varicella is considered contagious from 1-2 days before rash onset until all
lesions have crusted.22 A person with active herpes zoster is contagious when the rash
is  vesicular,  and  no  longer  infectious  to  others  once  the  rash  has  crusted  over.17
Herpes  zoster  is  less  contagious  than  varicella,  and  the  risk  of  a  person  with  herpes
zoster  spreading  the  virus  is  low  if  the  rash  is  covered.1417  A  varicella-like  rash  can
occur at the injection site after receipt of varicella vaccine and is generally self-limited.
Transmission  of  vaccine  virus  to  others  is  rare.2023  More  information  about  the

 Varicella
 is
 highly
contagious,  with  secondary  infection  occurring  in  61-100%  of  susceptible  household
contacts.  Varicella  is  characterized  by  a  pruritic,  maculopapular  vesicular  rash  that
evolves  into  noninfectious  dried  crusts  over  a  4-7  day  period.21  A  mild  prodrome  of
fever  and  malaise  may  occur  1  to  2  days  before  rash  onset,  particularly  in  adults.22
Acute  varicella  is  generally  mild  and  self-limited,  but  it  may  be  associated  with
complications.20  Immunocompromised  and  pregnant  adults  without  evidence  of
immunity
 to
 varicella
 are
 at
 increased
 risk
 for
 severe
 varicella
(https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/hcp/#high-risk-people).24
 Examples
 of
immunocompromised HCP at high risk for severe varicella include those with leukemia
or  lymphoma,  cellular  immune-deficiencies,  and  on  medications  that  suppress  the
immune  system  such  as  high  dose  steroids  or  chemotherapeutic  agents.16
Immunocompromised  persons  are  at  risk  for  developing  visceral  dissemination,
pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.24 In
addition, they can present with increased numbers of skin lesions that may be atypical
(i.e.,  hemorrhagic),  that  can  continue  to  develop,  and  that  can  have  longer  duration
than  immunocompetent  hosts  with  varicella.  Pregnant  persons  without  evidence  of
immunity to varicella are at risk for complications of varicella, such as VZV pneumonia,
with  increased  frequency  and  severity  in  the  3rd  trimester.  If  an  individual  develops
varicella  in  the  first  or  early  second  trimester  of  pregnancy,  the  baby  is  at  risk  for
congenital  varicella  syndrome; if the individual  develops a  varicella  rash  from 5 days
before  to  2  days  after  delivery,  the  baby  is  at  risk  for  neonatal  varicella.24
Breakthrough varicella is infection occurring in a vaccinated person more than 42 days
post-vaccination.22  Breakthrough  disease  is  generally  milder  than  disease  in
unvaccinated persons, often with fewer than 50 skin lesions, mostly maculopapular with
few vesicles, compared with 300 or more skin lesions, mostly vesicular in unvaccinated
persons.22  Given  its  modified  clinical  presentation,  breakthrough  varicella  can  be
challenging  for  practitioners  to  recognize.  Persons  with  breakthrough  disease  are  still
contagious to others, though they usually are less so than unvaccinated persons with
varicella.2225  Herpes zoster usually presents as a vesicular rash with pain and itching
in a localized dermatomal distribution.26 The rash may also be disseminated – defined
as the appearance of lesions outside the primary or adjacent dermatomes – mainly in
immunocompromised  persons.26  Postherpetic  neuralgia  (PHN),  or  pain  in  the  area  of
the  rash  that  persists  after  the  lesions  have  resolved,  is  a  complication  of  herpes
zoster.2026  The clinical diagnosis of varicella has become increasingly challenging as a
growing proportion of cases occur in vaccinated persons in whom disease is mild and
modified,  and  HCP  encounter  patients  with  varicella  less  frequently.327  Given  these
factors,  laboratory  testing  to  confirm  the  diagnosis  in  affected  HCP  has  become
increasingly  important.  Polymerase  chain  reaction  (PCR)  is  the  laboratory  testing
method  of  choice  to  confirm  varicella.  Ideal  samples  for  testing  are  vesicular  fluid  or
crusts from skin lesions.2829 VZV may also be isolated in tissue culture, although this
method is less sensitive and requires several days to obtain results.2021 The signs and
symptoms of herpes zoster are usually distinctive enough to make an accurate clinical
diagnosis once the rash has appeared.30 However, clinical diagnosis of herpes zoster
might not be possible in the absence of a rash, and laboratory testing can confirm VZV
infection when the rash may be similar in appearance to other diseases, such as herpes
simplex virus.303132 Additional information regarding VZV testing is available on the
CDC
 website
 
 (https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/lab-testing/index.html)33
 and
(https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/diagnosistesting.html).30   ACIP  recommends  that
exposed  HCP  without  evidence  of  immunity  to  varicella  receive  postexposure
vaccination
 as
 soon
 as
 possible
(https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5604a1.htm)3   Vaccination  within  3
to  5  days  of  exposure  may  modify  the  disease  if  infection  occurs.3  Vaccination  6  or
more  days  after  exposure  is  still  indicated  because  it  induces  protection  against
subsequent exposures.3 For HCP without evidence of immunity to varicella who have a
contraindication  to  varicella  vaccination  and  are  at  increased  risk  for  severe  disease
(e.g.,
 pregnant,
 immunocompromised),
 varicella-zoster
 immune
 globulin
 is
recommended to be administered as soon as possible (within 10 days) after exposure
to VZV.23 Administration of immune globulin can prolong the incubation period to 28
days after exposure.2 Detailed information regarding dosage and administration of PEP
is
 available
 on
 the
 CDC
 website
 
(https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6228a4.htm;
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5604a1.htm).2,3,33
 
 For
immunocompetent  HCP  with  localized  herpes  zoster  that  can  be  completely  covered,
risk for transmission to patients or other HCP is low, and these HCP typically remain at
work. Restricting these HCP from providing direct care to those at high risk for severe
varicella  (https://www.cdc.gov/chickenpox/hcp/#high-risk-people)24  might  provide  an
added layer of protection for these patients, but is not readily implemented when these
patients are not easily identified (e.g., evidence of immunity to varicella is unknown).
Hence,  restricting  these  HCP  from  caring  for  patients  at  high  risk  for  severe  varicella
may  be  reasonably  applied  in  selected  situations  (e.g.,  restricted  from  caring  for
patients  placed  in  a  protective  environment,  such  as  a  hematopoietic  stem  cell
transplant unit or neonatal intensive care unit). CDC provides information on infection
control  and  clinical  safety  to  help  reduce  the  risk  of  infections  among  healthcare
workers, patients, and visitors. Languages Language Assistance Languages  Language
