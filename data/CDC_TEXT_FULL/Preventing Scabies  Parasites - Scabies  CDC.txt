mites generally do not survive more than 2 â€“ 3 days away from human skin. Children
and  adults  can  return  to  childcare,  school,  or  work  the  day  after  treatment.
Aggressively  treat  crusted  (Norwegian)  scabies  to  prevent  an  outbreak.  Outbreaks  in
institutions can be difficult to control and require quick action to prevent further spread.
Animals do not spread human scabies. Pets can become infected with a different kind of
scabies  mite.  This  is  what  causes  mange  in  animals.  The  scabies  mites  that  infest
animals  cannot  survive  or  reproduce  on  humans.  However,  they  can  get  under  your
skin  and  cause  temporary  itching  and  irritation.  Therefore,  it's  important  to  treat  all
animals  infected  with  mange.    Scabies  is  an  infestation  of  the  skin  by  a  human  itch
mite. Languages Language Assistance Languages  Language Assistance
