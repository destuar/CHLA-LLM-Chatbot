Safe steps in food handling, cooking, and storage are essential to prevent foodborne illness. You can’t see, smell,
or taste harmful bacteria that may cause illness. In every step of food preparation, follow the four steps of the
Food Safe Families campaign to keep food safe:

                    •                   Clean - Wash hands and surfaces often.                                                               Preparation

                    •                   Chill - Refrigerate promptly.                                                                                     •  Don’t cross-contaminate. Keep raw meat,

Serving
     •    Hot food should be held at 140 °F (60 °C) or
          warmer.
     •    Cold food should be held at 40 °F (4.4 ºC) or
          colder.
     •    When serving food at a buffet, keep food hot
          with chafing dishes, slow cookers, and warming
          trays. Keep food cold by nesting dishes in bowls
          of ice or use small serving trays and replace
          them often.
     •    Perishable food should not be left out more than
          2 hours at room temperature--1 hour when the
          temperature is above 90 °F (32.2 ºC).
