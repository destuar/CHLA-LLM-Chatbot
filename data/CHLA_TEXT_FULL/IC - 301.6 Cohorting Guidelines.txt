                    IC – 301.6 Cohorting Guidelines

                    Before utilizing the grid below, first consider the following in cohorting patients:

                         •    When cohorting needs arise, Standard Precautions patients should be cohorted first.

                         •    If there are no more eligible Standard Precautions patients to cohort, only then should you
                              use these guidelines to determine appropriate cohorting for Combined-Droplet patients.

                         •    Testing strongly recommended before cohorting.

                         •    Any new onset of symptoms would require the patient to be placed in a single room. Re-
                              testing for COVID-19 is recommended.

Combined-Droplet Precautions Cohorting
Disease                          When is it appropriate to cohort?

Respiratory symptoms,            Okay to cohort like illnesses if within
viral pathogen                   approximately 3-5 days of onset of
identified                       illness (example: two Flu A patients,
                                 two RSV patients) – including
                                 patients on AGPs




















When is it NOT appropriate to
cohort?
•    Do not cohort one patient who
     just developed a URI with
     another patient who developed
     symptoms >7 days prior.
•    Do not cohort
     immunocompromised
     patients with viral URI*
•    Do not cohort patients with
     different species of Influenza
     (e.g. Influenza A and Influenza
     B)
•    Patient in Combined-Eyewear
     during their
     isolation/quarantine period
     (reference Patient and Family
     Quarantine and Deisolation
     Reference Guide for details)
•    Patient with parent/visitor who
     is symptomatic or has known
     COVID-19 (reference Patient
     and Family Quarantine and
     Deisolation Reference Guide for
     details)
