         To decrease the chance of getting MRSA your
         family and friends should:
         • Clean their hands before they enter your
           room and when they leave.
         • Ask a healthcare provider if they need to
           wear protective gowns and gloves when
           they visit you.
         What do I need to do when I go home from
         the hospital?

         To prevent another MRSA infection and to
         prevent spreading MRSA to others:
         • Keep taking any antibiotics prescribed
           by your doctor. Don’t take half-doses or
           stop before you complete your prescribed
           course.
         • Clean your hands often, especially before
           and after changing your wound dressing or
           bandage.
         • People who live with you should clean their
           hands often as well.
         • Keep any wounds clean and change
           bandages as instructed until healed.
         • Avoid sharing personal items such as
           towels or razors.
         • Wash and dry your clothes and bed
           linens in the warmest temperatures
           recommended on the labels.
         • Tell your healthcare providers that you
           have MRSA. This includes home health
           nurses and aides, therapists, and personnel
           in doctors’ offices.
         • Your doctor may have more instructions for
           you.
         If you have questions, please ask your doctor
         or nurse.
