  PURPOSE:
      CCR, Title 22 Chapter 1. 70723 (b) (1) requires General Acute Care Hospitals use a 5 Tuberculin Unit
      dose of PPD in screening healthcare workers (HCWs) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). This
      policy was submitted along with a letter to the CDPH Licensing and Certification district office that
      has jurisdiction over CHLA. The purpose of this policy is to allow program flexibility and the use of
      Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) blood tests either in conjunction with or separate from
      Tuberculosis Skin Tests (TSTs) in screening of new hire employees, volunteers, students and others
      defined as Health Care Workers (HCWs). It is also intended to provide program flexibility in annual
      surveillance screening for tuberculosis (TB) infection and Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) in
      HCWs.

      “This policy applies to the following personnel (regardless of their employer) who work for any
      portion of a day at any location in which CHLA is responsible for the care of and provides services to
      patients including , but not limited to hospitals, outpatient clinics, home health, student and employee
      health centers, dental clinics, and pharmacies:
       •   All faculty, CHLA employees, volunteers, licensed health care professionals, medical staff
           members,        residents,      fellows,     researchers,       medical      students,      nursing       students,      nurse
           practitioner/physician assistant students, pharmacy students, respiratory therapy students,
           radiation technology students, all other students receiving training at a CHLA health care facility,
           vendors, representatives or distributors of a manufacturer or company who visit for the purpose
           of soliciting, marketing, or distributing products or information regarding the use of medications,
           products, equipment and/or services.”

           4.       IGRAs (Blood tests that detect an immune response to Mycobacterium TB). With reference
                    to this policy we are referring to the QFT-G (QUANTIFERON GOLD TEST), the QFT-GIT
                    (QUANTIFERON GOLD IN-TUBE TEST), and the T-SPOT.

  PROCEDURE
           1.       All newly hired employees, new volunteers, and newly assigned students will be screened
                    for TB Infection by either the 5 TU PPD TST, or one of the 3 IGRAs listed above. The tests
                    will be conducted either by the CHLA lab or another approved lab as appropriate and shall
                    be conducted in accordance with CDC, CDPH, OSHA and MMWR guidelines.
           2.       TSTs or IGRAs will be used to screen HCWs known to be exposed to Tuberculosis.
           3.       A HCW with a positive TSTs or IGRA will be further screened for active TB by Chest X-ray,
                    symptom questionnaire and physical examination if indicated
           4.       Appropriate follow up will include: TB conversion tracking, isolation from hospital staff
                    and patients as indicated, and medical follow up with either the department of public
                    health, a private medical provider, or with the company medical provider network if
                    determined compensable under the workers’ compensation system. Evaluation of test
                    results, the initial HCW evaluation, and initiation of treatment (if work related), and
                    follow-up determination will be conducted by Employee Health (EHS).
