 POLICY NUMBER: IC – 830.0CHLA        CHAPTER: ENTERPRISE – INFECTION CONTROL                                                  PAGE 1 of 2
PURPOSE:

CHLA continues to take a conservative approach to its use of PPE. To ensure current supplies of
N95 respirators are adequate for an extended period, CHLA has implemented N95 respirator disinfection
reprocessing.

PROCEDURE:

     I.       Collection of N95 Respirators
                   1. Staff and providers allocated a N95 respirator will doff the respirator appropriately.
                       Staff label the bottom edge of the mask with their first name, last name and unit so it can
                       be returned to them after reprocessing.
                   2. Staff place the N95 respirator in a paper bag and store it in the designated plastic bin in
                       the unit’s selected dirty utility room.
                   3. After performing hand hygiene, staff should don the surgical mask issued at the start of
                       the shift to wear until exiting the hospital.

     II.      Reprocessing of N95 Respirators
                   1. The two disinfection methodologies that have been validated are UVC disinfection
                       (Helios Surfacide machines) and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) sterilization
                       (Bioquell machines). VHP is the preferred method as it can reprocess all N95 respirators
                       and is not limited to structure or “hard-shell” N95 masks.

     III.     Redistribution of N95 Respirators
                   1. Mark respirators with “X”or “I” tally, then place into individual bags.
                   2. N95 respirators can be safely reused after being reprocessed 3 times. If the N95 mask
                       begins deteriorating due to use (particularly if the straps break), it can be discarded
                       before reaching the 3rd time reprocessed amount threshold.
                   3. Visibly soiled or unlabeled N95 masks will be discarded.
                   4. Unit or group representative will pick up respective N95 masks to be redistributed to
                       staff and faculty from the mask reprocessing area.
                   5. Obtain new N95 mask per protocol until receipt of disinfected N95 mask.
