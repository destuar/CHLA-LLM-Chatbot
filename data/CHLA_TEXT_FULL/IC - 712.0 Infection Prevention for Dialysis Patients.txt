         12.      All used patient dialyzer and tubing must be carefully placed in double red biohazard
                  trash.
         13.      Waste dialysate from machines should be drained into closed plastic bags to prevent
                  splashing or aerosolization.
         14.      Dialysis units are considered contaminated areas; housekeeping personnel must wear
                  gowns and gloves when cleaning the units.

         Patient-related Practices:
         1.       Chloroprep is used for skin preparation. If a patient is sensitive to Chloroprep, povidone
                  iodine is used. If a patient is also sensitive to povidone iodine, the prepped area is allowed
                  to dry for one minute and the solution wiped off with alcohol.
         2.       Subclavian or femoral catheter care is done prior to each dialysis (refer to PCS policy CC
                  192.0 Central Venous Catheters (CVC’s) Care and Maintenance -- for the specific techniques
                  required).
         3.       Peritoneal catheter care is done with each dialysis treatment
         4.       Appropriate cultures are obtained immediately for any suspected infection.
         5.       Fistula and dialysis catheter cleaning procedures as outlined in PCS procedures and
                  policies under section IV are performed every time dialysis is performed.
         6.       Any drainage from skin lesion, wound, catheter or fistula will be cultured and appropriate
                  measures taken as outlined in procedure.
         7.       Wounds other than fistula or catheter site must be dressed and dressing changed in
                  patient's room rather than on dialysis units.
         8.       Elevations of temperature over 38° C during hemodialysis are considered a pyrogenic
                  reaction and appropriate measures are taken, as outlined in procedure.

         Bloodborne Pathogen Transmission Prevention:
         1.       ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels are performed monthly on all patients undergoing extended
                  dialysis. If elevations are noted, further serial observations are made.
         2.       Quarterly HBsAg determination is done on all patients undergoing dialysis who have not
                  converted to HBsAb positive status. (Patients are routinely given HBV vaccine).
         3.       Prior to the first dialysis, Hepatitis A, HBsAg, Hepatitis C, HIV, ALT and AST are drawn.
         4.       Patients who are HIV positive or carry a diagnosis of AIDS can be dialyzed safely if
                  principles of Standard (Universal) Precautions are strictly applied. The sterilization
                  procedure outlined in the Care of the Equipment section is adequate. Nevertheless patients
                  who have AIDS, hepatitis, or are HBsAg positive will be treated as follows:
                  a.        Isolation room
                  b.        Equipment used for the patient with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is reserved for use on

          2.       Machines are disinfected daily with vinegar and heat by Dialysis staff.
          3.       Machines are cultured by the Dialysis Technician once a month and whenever clinical
                   indications suggest pyrogenic and/or septicemic complications. If any culture, water or
                   dialysate, shows a count of 200 colonies per mL or greater, or if the action level of 50
                   cfu/mL, is reached in product water, the machine must be disinfected according to
                   procedure by the BioMedical (Biomed) engineering team.
          4.       Reverse osmosis water is cultured monthly by the Dialysis Technician. If the culture is
                   positive, Biomed engineering is responsible for treating R.O. systems, including portable
                   RO systems, with bleach and formaldehyde.
          5.       CHLA tests Reverse Osmosis, Dialysis machines, and at the first loop of piping system for
                   endotoxins monthly. Acceptable results must be lower than 1 EU/ml per AAMI standards.
                   If results are greater than or equal to 1EU/ML the machine must be disinfected according to
                   procedure by Biomed engineering. Any Dialysis machines or Reverse Osmosis machines
                   that test positive with an action level > 50 cfu/mL, will be disinfected within 24 hours and
                   re-cultured within 48 hours after disinfection.

         6.        Dialysis solution from every hemodialysis machine is cultured once a month by Dialysis
                   staff
         7.        Reusable clamps (Kellys) are sent to Sterile Processing Department for high level
                   disinfection in between patient use. Single use clamps (blue plastic kellys) are discarded
                   after a single patient use.
         8.        All tubing and filters are single-use only and replaced after each dialysis.
         9.        Transducer filters are used on arterial and venous monitor lines to prevent contamination.
                   Transducer filters are for single patient use and treatment only.
         10.       The outside of the hemodialysis machines and IPD cyclers are wiped by Dialysis staff with
                   1:10 bleach solution or bleach wipes. Surfaces are maintained wet with bleach solution until
                   the contact time of 1 minute is met.
