Algorithm for Management of Varicella Exposure

1. Identify Index Case:
   - Confirmed:
     - If VZV is isolated from a clinical specimen then confirm varicella.
     - If VZV DNA is detected by PCR tests from a clinical specimen (ideally scabs, vesicular fluid, or cells from the base of a lesion) then confirm varicella.
     - If there is a fourfold or greater rise in serum varicella IgG antibody titer then confirm varicella.
   - Probable:
     - If there is a high index of suspicion characterized by:
       - Acute onset of diffuse maculopapular/vesicular rash without other apparent cause
       - No history of varicella vaccination or prior varicella infection
       - Possible exposure to a VZV patient in the past 3 weeks
     - Then consider varicella probable.

2. Is the Index Case Infectious?
   - If the index case is within the infectious period (two days before the onset of rash until lesions are crusted over) then the case is infectious.

3. Does the Case Require Exposure Follow-up?
   - If there are disseminated lesions, localized lesions on >2 dermatomes, or localized lesions in an immunocompromised patient then follow up on exposure.

4. Identify Exposed Contacts:
   - If contacts include patients, employees, students, or visitors then identify who among them is susceptible.
   - If contacts are not immunized against VZV, have no history of VZV disease, or are immunocompromised then consider them susceptible.

5. Actions for Susceptible Contacts:
   - If immunocompromised then administer Varicella-Zoster Immune Globulin (VariZIG) within 3-5 days post-exposure but up to 10 days post-exposure.
   - If susceptible then monitor for symptoms and isolate in Airborne Precautions from day 8-21 after exposure. If patient received VariZIG or IGIV then isolate from day 8-28 after exposure.
   - If active disease is present then impose appropriate work restrictions.
   - CHLA Team Members:
     - If exposed then remain off work for the incubation period (8-21 days).
     - If returning to work then employee contacts EHS for clearance.
   - Visitors:
     - If exposed then limit or restrict hospital visitation for the incubation period.

6. Notifications:
   - If a varicella case is identified then notify Infection Control at Ext 15510 during normal business hours.
   - If after hours/holidays/weekends then contact ID physician on call and leave a message on the IC voicemail.
   - If a varicella case is identified then begin collecting names of exposed contacts.
   - If after hours then contact LACDPH to report the case at (213) 240-7941.
