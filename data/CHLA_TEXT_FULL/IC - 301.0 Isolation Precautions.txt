                        Precautions, display both the staff transmission-based isolation sign and staff Protective
                        Precautions sign.

Transportation of Isolated Patients:
         1. Patients on Isolation Precautions should only leave their rooms for medical/surgical reasons,
              in order to reduce opportunities for transmission of microorganisms in the hospital.
         2. Notify personnel in the receiving unit of the patient’s Isolation Precautions. On arrival,
              appropriate isolation precautions should be applied when handling the patient.
         3. All transportation equipment (wheelchair, bed, etc.) should be wiped down with hospital-
              approved disinfectants before and after use.
         4. Personal Protective Equipment for patient being transported:
                   a. All patients should be in clean pajamas or isolation gown prior to transport.
                   b. Patient on Combined-Droplet or Combined-Airborne Precautions should wear a
                        standard surgical mask during transport.
                   c. Patient on Mask or Protective Precautions should wear a Biomask during transport
                   d. Immunocompromised patients traveling to non-Hepa filtered areas of the hospital
                        should wear a BioMask regardless of their isolation status.
         5. Personal Protective Equipment for staff doing the transportation:
                   a. If at all possible, a two-staff transport is preferred, so that one staff member can be the
                        “clean” transporter who touches elevator buttons, opens doors, etc. and the other staff
                        member can serve as the “patient care” transporter who performs patient care as needed
                        during transport.
                   b. If a two-staff transport is not available, one staff member may transport an isolated
                        patient. This staff member should carry gloves with them to avoid cross-contamination.

Isolation Precautions in Special Patient Groups
              1. Cystic Fibrosis (CF)
                       a. All patients with cystic fibrosis must be separated from each other at least 6 feet
                            apart in all clinical environments. No more than one patient with CF should be in
                            the same room (i.e., gift shop) indoors at the same time.
                       b. Patients admitted to CHLA with Cystic Fibrosis may leave their rooms if they wear
                            appropriate personal protective equipment (mask, gown, and gloves). They may go
                            to open spaces (garden), gift shop, interfaith center, etc. They may go to the HBO
                            Café and Farmer’s Market, except from 11:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m., due to crowding
                            during those hours.
                       Exceptions:
                                 i. If patients with CF are admitted with viral/URI symptoms (cough, sneeze,
                                     etc.), GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, etc.), or any draining wounds
                                     they should remain in their rooms until symptoms resolve. They may then
                                     go outside their rooms as above.
                                ii. Patients with highly communicable infections (i.e., Burkholderia cepacia,
                                     tuberculosis) should remain in their rooms in appropriate isolation as per
                                     hospital policy for all such patients.
                       c. All inpatients with CF must be placed in Contact Precautions from April through
                            October (non-viral respiratory season) and be placed in Combined-Droplet
                            Precautions from November through March (viral respiratory season).
                       d. Patients with CF in the ambulatory setting (other than Pulmonary Clinic) must also
                            follow isolation precautions as referenced above. Although patients with CF in the
                            ambulatory setting will not be required to be placed in a private room, clinics must
                            ensure that they are at least 6 feet apart from other CF patients.
                       e. Patients with CF are not allowed in the Playroom.

Isolation Precautions in Operating Room (OR) and Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC)
         1. Surgical Admitting staff will notify House Supervisor and recovery areas of isolation status to
              allow for appropriate placement of patients.
         2. Special procedure areas (e.g. PACU, OR etc.) will utilize isolation requirements in the patient’s
              immediate environment.
         3. Patients on Transmission-Based Precautions may not have procedures performed in the ASC,
              and instead must be scheduled in the main OR. Exceptions may be made on a case by case
              basis in consultation with Infection Prevention and Control.
         4. Patients on Combined-Airborne precautions who require surgical procedures must be
              scheduled in the Main OR.
                   a. Infection Prevention & Control (IPC) staff should be notified of these scheduled
                       procedures in advance in order to coordinate with OR and Facilities/Engineering.
                   b. See IC – 301.3 for OR requirements for patients on Combined-Airborne Precautions.
                       Cleaning procedures: staff should wait 30 minutes prior to clean OR after patient leaves.
                       Staff must perform a Terminal clean after procedure, followed by treatment with Xenex
                       UV disinfection system. Refer to IC – 716.0 Cleaning and Disinfection for more
                       information.

         ii. Known or suspected viral Upper Respiratory Infection
                  1. Patient should be provided with a surgical mask immediately.
                  2. All staff caring for patients with these symptoms should wear surgical masks as a
                       precaution.
        iii. Known or suspected airborne-transmissible disease (i.e. Measles, Tuberculosis, Varicella)
                  1. Patient should be provided with a surgical mask immediately.
                  2. As soon as the risk is identified, patient must be moved from the waiting room into a
                       closed private room.
                  3. Due to the lack of negative pressure isolation rooms in the ambulatory care setting, the
                       patient should either be sent home or transferred to a unit capable of caring for patients
                       in Airborne Precautions as soon as possible.
                       a. Until the patient is able to be discharged or transferred, healthcare workers who
                            have completed annual Fit Testing should use N95 respirators or CAPR/PAPRs
                            when caring for these patients. See Aerosol Transmissible Disease (ATD) Exposure
                            Control Plan for more information.
        iv. Known CRO (Carbapenem-Resistant Organism) colonization or infection (see IC – 825.0 for
              more details)
                  1. Healthcare providers should wear gown and gloves when caring for known CP-CRO
                       patients in ambulatory settings.
                  2. If possible, these patients should be scheduled for the last appointment of the clinic in a
                       private room.
         v. The patient room or bay should be terminally cleaned after the appointment if additional
              isolation precautions is indicated.

3. Disinfection of patient care areas and reusable items must be performed using hospital-approved
    disinfectants (see IC – 716.0 Cleaning and Disinfection for more information).

Patient Discharge/ Patient Transfer Room Downtime Requirements (Contaminated Air Clearance
Time) – For Combined Airborne, Combine Eyewear, and SP Eyewear

1. There are no restrictions for staff entering a patient's room after discharge/transfer if the appropriate
    PPE is worn
2. It is safe to remove respiratory protection (N95/PAPR/CAPR) once 99% of airborne contaminants
    have been removed by the room’s ventilation system. The table below outlines the amount of time
    needed for the ventilation system to remove 99% of airborne contaminants once the patient has left the
    room. All other PPE are required until the room has been cleaned and disinfected by EVS staff.
