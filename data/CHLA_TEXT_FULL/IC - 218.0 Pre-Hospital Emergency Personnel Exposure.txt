PURPOSE:

Exposure of Pre-hospital emergency personnel to emergency victims may, on occasion, present risks for
contracting a communicable Infectious disease.
Patients at higher risk for communicable infectious diseases tend to use emergency services at a higher rate
than the general population. All emergency victims, therefore, present a potential risk to all care providers.
EMS personnel may be at risk for bloodborne pathogens (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis), pathogens transmitted by
direct contact (e.g. Multi-Drug Resistant Organisms), pathogens transmitted by respiratory droplets (e.g.
upper respiratory infections, influenza, pneumonia, Tuberculosis), and more.
The purpose of the following policy is to outline infection prevention strategies and exposure follow-up for
EMS personnel.

PROCEDURES:

    1. Standard Precautions should be followed at all times when caring for patients. See IC 220.0 for more
         details.
              a. Eating, drinking, storing food/drinks, and activities that involve touching one’s face or
                  mouth should be avoided where there is a risk of occupational exposure to blood or body
                  fluids.
    2. If patient has confirmed or suspected communicable diseases, emergency personnel should use
         appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) that is available in transport vehicles and/or
         helicopters as per policy IC 220.0 Standard Precautions or IC 301.0 Isolation Precautions.
    3. EMS personnel should perform hand hygiene according to IC 212.0 Hand Hygiene.
    4. Transport vehicles and equipment should be disinfected between patient use as per IC 716.0
         Cleaning Disinfection.

Exposure of Transportation personnel
If there is a suspected or confirmed bloodborne pathogen or communicable disease exposure:

          1.      The exposed personnel will notify their employer immediately and follow the agency
                  Occupational Health policy.
          2.      Contracted helicopter pilots and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) are treated under
                  CHLA Employee Exposure Plan and seen by Employee Health Service (refer to IC – 601.0
