POLICY NUMBER: IC – 210.0CHLA      CHAPTER: ENTERPRISE – INFECTION CONTROL                                                PAGE 1 of 2
 PURPOSE:
     All CHLA employees will take the necessary steps to ensure their personal food and drink is
     prepared, stored and consumed in a manner that reduces the risk for food-related pathogens. The
     purpose of this policy is to provide a working environment free of conditions that could expose
     individuals to food-related pathogens. Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standard
     1910.1030 regulates where food and drink may be consumed in a healthcare setting, prohibiting
     consumption where blood or other potentially infectious materials are present, in order to prevent
     cross-contamination

     All CHLA employees shall be responsible for adhering to strict guidelines for sanitation and infection
     control in regard to the proper storage, preparation, and consumption of food and beverage.

 PROCEDURE:

          3. Covered employee beverages can be consumed in nursing stations in designated and marked
              areas that are strictly separated from areas where blood, body fluids, or other infectious or
              toxic materials are located or stored. No dirty or contaminated items may be stored in these
              designated beverage zones.
          4. Employee food will be stored in a refrigerator designated for employee use. Employees will be
              responsible for the prompt clean up and storage of their food.

                    c. No alcoholic beverages will be stored or consumed on the premises, unless authorized
                    to do so.
          5. Fresh produce purchased from the CHLA Farmer’s Market should be bagged before bringing
              into the hospital.
