POLICY NUMBER: IC – 404.0CHLA       CHAPTER: ENTERPRISE – INFECTION CONTROL                                                  PAGE 1 of 1
PURPOSE:
     Children’s Hospital Los Angeles routinely reviews antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to aid in the
     control of hospital acquired infections by identifying changes in the in vitro susceptibility patterns of
     bacteria isolated from clinical specimens to various antimicrobial agents used to treat infection at this
     institution.

PROCEDURES:
         1.        The Microbiology Section of the Clinical Laboratory is responsible for collecting and
                   compiling data on susceptibility patterns. Data are organized in the following manner:
                   a.       An antibiogram is published once per year that summarizes the percentage of
                            individual bacterial pathogens of clinical interest susceptible to select antimicrobial
                            agents.
         2.        Reports, summarizing the data, are made available to the Attending, House Staff and
                   relevant committees and published once each year in the CHLA Pharmacy Pink Book.
         3.        Data are reported to the Hospital Infection Control Committee on a yearly basis, or as
                   significant changes are identified.
         4.        The Hospital Infection Control Committee is responsible for coordination with the
                   appropriate committee personnel on action relative to the findings from susceptibility
                   studies which pertain to infection control.
