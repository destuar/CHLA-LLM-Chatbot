IC – 301.1 Appendix A:
Preamble       The mode(s) and risk of transmission for each specific disease agent included in Appendix A were reviewed.
Principle sources consulted for the development of disease-specific recommendations for Appendix A included infectious
disease manuals and textbooks 833, 1043, 1044. The published literature was searched for evidence of person-to-person
transmission in healthcare and non-healthcare settings with a focus on reported outbreaks that would assist in developing
recommendations for all settings where healthcare is delivered. Criteria used to assign Transmission-Based Precautions
categories follow:
    •   A Transmission-Based Precautions category was assigned if there was strong evidence for person-to-person
        transmission via droplet, contact, or airborne routes in healthcare or non-healthcare settings and/or if patient
        factors (e.g., diapered infants, diarrhea, draining wounds) increased the risk of transmissionr
    •   Transmission-Based Precautions category assignments reflect the predominant mode(s) of transmission
    •   If there was no evidence for person-to-person transmission by droplet, contact or airborne routes, Standard
        Precautions were assigned
    •   If there was a low risk for person-to-person transmission and no evidence of healthcare-associated transmission,
        Standard Precautions were assigned
    •   Standard Precautions were assigned for bloodborne pathogens (e.g., hepatitis B and C viruses, human
        immunodeficiency virus) as per CDC recommendations for Universal Precautions issued in 1988 780. Subsequent
        experience has confirmed the efficacy of Standard Precautions to prevent exposure to infected blood and body
        fluid 778, 779, 866.
Additional information relevant to use of precautions was added in the comments column to assist the caregiver in
decision-making. Citations were added as needed to support a change in or provide additional evidence for
recommendations for a specific disease and for new infectious agents (e.g., SARS-CoV, avian influenza) that have been
added to Appendix A. The reader may refer to more detailed discussion concerning modes of transmission and emerging
pathogens in the background text and for MDRO control in Appendix B.

Not transmitted from person to person


Person to person transmission is rare. Transmission in settings for the
mentally challenged and in a family group has been reported 1045. Use
care when handling diapered infants and mentally challenged persons
1046.
Infected patients do not generally pose a transmission risk.
Transmission through non-intact skin contact with draining lesions
possible, therefore use Contact Precautions if large amount of
uncontained drainage. Handwashing with soap and water preferable

Use Contact Precautions for diapered or incontinent persons for the

clean areas heavily contaminated with feces or vomitus may benefit
from wearing masks since virus can be aerosolized from these body
substances 142, 147 148; ensure consistent environmental cleaning and
disinfection with focus on restrooms even when apparently unsoiled
273, 1064). Hypochlorite solutions may be required when there is
continued transmission 290-292. Alcohol is less active, but there is no
evidence that alcohol antiseptic handrubs are not effective for hand
decontamination 294. Cohorting of affected patients to separate
airspaces and toilet facilities may help interrupt transmission during
outbreaks.
Ensure consistent environmental cleaning and disinfection and
frequent removal of soiled diapers. Prolonged shedding may occur in

                Precautions
Comments
Susceptible HCWs should not provide direct patient care when other
immune caregivers are available.
Not transmitted from person to person
Post-exposure chemoprophylaxis for some blood exposures 866.
HAI reported 1071, but route of transmission not established 823.
Assumed to be Contact transmission as for RSV since the viruses are
closely related and have similar clinical manifestations and
epidemiology. Wear masks according to Standard Precautions..



Single patient room when available or cohort; avoid placement with
high-risk patients; mask patient when transported out of room;
chemoprophylaxis/vaccine to control/prevent outbreaks 611. Use gown

and gloves according to Standard Precautions may be especially
important in pediatric settings. Duration of precautions for
immunocompromised patients cannot be defined; prolonged duration
of viral shedding (i.e. for several weeks) has been observed;
implications for transmission are unknown 930.

See meningococcal disease below

Concurrent, active pulmonary disease or draining cutaneous lesions
may necessitate addition of Contact and/or Airborne Precautions;
For children, airborne precautions until active tuberculosis ruled out in
visiting family members (see tuberculosis below) 42

Postexposure chemoprophylaxis for household contacts, HCWs
exposed to respiratory secretions; postexposure vaccine only to
control outbreaks 15, 17.

                 Precautions
Comments

MDROs judged by the infection control program, based on local, state,
regional, or national recommendations, to be of clinical and
epidemiologic significance. Contact Precautions recommended in
settings with evidence of ongoing transmission, acute care settings
with increased risk for transmission or wounds that cannot be
contained by dressings. See recommendations for management
options in Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms In
Healthcare Settings, 2006 870. Contact state health department for
guidance regarding new or emerging MDRO.
After onset of swelling; susceptible HCWs should not provide care if
immune caregivers are available.
Note: (Recent assessment of outbreaks in healthy 18-24 year olds has
indicated that salivary viral shedding occurred early in the course of
illness and that 5 days of isolation after onset of parotitis may be
appropriate in community settings; however the implications for
healthcare personnel and high-risk patient populations remain to be
clarified.)

                 Precautions
Comments


Use Contact Precautions if there is copious drainage

Not an infectious condition

Follow organism-specific (strep, staph most frequent)
recommendations and consider magnitude of drainage
Susceptible HCWs should not enter room if immune caregivers are
available; no recommendation for face protection of immune HCWs;
no recommendation for type of protection, i.e. surgical mask or
respirator for susceptible HCWs. In immunocompromised host with
varicella pneumonia, prolong duration of precautions for duration of
illness. Post-exposure prophylaxis: provide post-exposure vaccine
ASAP but within 120 hours; for susceptible exposed persons for whom
vaccine is contraindicated (immunocompromised persons, pregnant
women, newborns whose mother’s varicella onset is <5days before
delivery or within 48 hrs after delivery) provide VZIG, when available,
within 96 hours; if unavailable, use IVIG, Use Airborne Precautions for
exposed susceptible persons and exclude exposed susceptible
healthcare workers beginning 8 days after first exposure until 21 days
after last exposure or 28 if received VZIG, regardless of postexposure
vaccination. 1036.



Single-patient room preferred. Emphasize: 1) use of sharps safety

Comments
devices and safe work practices, 2) hand hygiene; 3) barrier protection
against blood and body fluids upon entry into room (single gloves and
fluid-resistant or impermeable gown, face/eye protection with masks,
goggles or face shields); and 4) appropriate waste handling. Use N95
or higher respirators when performing aerosol-generating procedures.
Largest viral load in final stages of illness when hemorrhage may
occur; additional PPE, including double gloves, leg and shoe
coverings may be used, especially in resource-limited settings where
options for cleaning and laundry are limited. Notify public health
officials immediately if Ebola is suspected 212, 314, 740, 772 Also see Table

- Introduced seven isolation precaution categories with color-coded
  cards: Strict, Respiratory, Protective, Enteric, Wound and Skin,
  Discharge, and Blood
- No user decision-making required
- Simplicity a strength; over isolation prescribed for some infections
- Same conceptual framework as 1st edition


- Provided two systems for isolation: category-specific and disease-
  specific
- Protective Isolation eliminated; Blood Precautions expanded to include
  Body Fluids
- Categories included Strict, Contact, Respiratory, AFB, Enteric,
  Drainage/Secretion, Blood and Body Fluids
- Emphasized decision-making by users

 * Derived from Garner ICHE 1996

- Emphasized avoiding contact with all moist and potentially infectious
  body substances except sweat even if blood not present
- Shared some features with Universal Precautions
- Weak on infections transmitted by large droplets or by contact with dry
  surfaces
- Did not emphasize need for special ventilation to contain airborne
  infections
- Handwashing after glove removal not specified in the absence of
  visible soiling
- Prepared by the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory
  Committee (HICPAC)
- Melded major features of Universal Precautions and Body
  Substance Isolation into Standard Precautions to be used with all
  patients at all times
- Included three transmission-based precaution categories: airborne,
  droplet, and contact
- Listed clinical syndromes that should dictate use of empiric isolation
  until an etiological diagnosis is established

                       Standard, Contact and Airborne Precautions should be used. Once the pathogen is characterized, if the
                       epidemiology of transmission is consistent with natural disease, Droplet Precautions can be substituted
                       for Airborne Precautions. Emphasize: 1) use of sharps safety devices and safe work practices, 2) hand
                       hygiene; 3) barrier protection against blood and body fluids upon entry into room (single gloves and fluid-

2 Pneumonic plague is not as contagious as is often thought. Historical accounts and contemporary evidence indicate that persons with plague usually only
transmit the infection when the disease is in the end stage. These persons cough copious amounts of bloody sputum that contains many plague bacteria. Patients
in the early stage of primary pneumonic plague (approximately the first 20–24 h) apparently pose little risk [1, 2]. Antibiotic medication rapidly clears the
sputum of plague bacilli, so that a patient generally is not infective within hours after initiation of effective antibiotic treatment [3]. This means that in modern
times many patients will never reach a stage where they pose a significant risk to others. Even in the end stage of disease, transmission only occurs after close
contact. Simple protective measures, such as wearing masks, good hygiene, and avoiding close contact, have been effective to interrupt transmission during many
pneumonic plague outbreaks [2]. In the United States, the last known cases of person to person transmission of pneumonic plague occurred in 1925 [2].

Patient resuscitation



For touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, contaminated items; for
touching mucous membranes and nonintact skin
During procedures and patient-care activities when contact of clothing/exposed
skin with blood/body fluids, secretions, and excretions is anticipated..
During procedures and patient-care activities likely to generate splashes or
sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, especially suctioning, endotracheal
intubation
Handle in a manner that prevents transfer of microorganisms to others and to the
environment; wear gloves if visibly contaminated; perform hand hygiene.
Develop procedures for routine care, cleaning, and disinfection of environmental
surfaces, especially frequently touched surfaces in patient-care areas.
Handle in a manner that prevents transfer of microorganisms to others and to the
environment
Do not recap, bend, break, or hand-manipulate used needles; if recapping is
required, use a one-handed scoop technique only; use safety features when
available; place used sharps in puncture-resistant container
Use mouthpiece, resuscitation bag, other ventilation devices to prevent contact
with mouth and oral secretions
                                                                                         129
Patient placement



Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette
(source containment of infectious
respiratory secretions in symptomatic
patients, beginning at initial point of
encounter e.g., triage and reception
areas in emergency departments and
physician offices)

             ** During aerosol-generating procedures on patients with suspected or proven infections transmitted by respiratory aerosols
                   (e.g., SARS), wear a fit-tested N95 or higher respirator in addition to gloves, gown,and face/eye protection.

Prioritize for single-patient room if patient is at increased risk of transmission, is
likely to contaminate the environment, does not maintain appropriate hygiene, or
is at increased risk of acquiring infection or developing adverse outcome following
infection.
Instruct symptomatic persons to cover mouth/nose when sneezing/coughing; use
tissues and dispose in no-touch receptacle; observe hand hygiene after soiling of
hands with respiratory secretions; wear surgical mask if tolerated or maintain
spatial separation, >3 feet if possible.

TABLE 5. COMPONENTS OF A PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENT
                              (Adapted from MMWR 2003; 52 [RR-10])

    I. Patients: allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplant (HSCT) only
       • Maintain in PE room except for required diagnostic or therapeutic procedures
         that cannot be performed in the room, e.g. radiology, operating room
       • Respiratory protection e.g., N95 respirator, for the patient when leaving PE
         during periods of construction

    II. Standard and Expanded Precautions
       • Hand hygiene observed before and after patient contact
       • Gown, gloves, mask NOT required for HCWs or visitors for routine entry into
         the room
       • Use of gown, gloves, mask by HCWs and visitors according to Standard
         Precautions and as indicated for suspected or proven infections for which
         Transmission-Based Precautions are recommended

    III. Engineering
       • Central or point-of-use HEPA (99.97% efficiency) filters capable of removing
         particles 0.3 m in diameter for supply (incoming) air
       • Well-sealed rooms
           o Proper construction of windows, doors, and intake and exhaust ports
           o Ceilings: smooth, free of fissures, open joints, crevices
           o Walls sealed above and below the ceiling
           o If leakage detected, locate source and make necessary repairs
       • Ventilation to maintain >12 ACH
       • Directed air flow: air supply and exhaust grills located so that clean, filtered
         air enters from one side of the room, flows across the patient’s bed, exits on
         opposite side of the room
       • Positive room air pressure in relation to the corridor
           o Pressure differential of >2.5 Pa [0.01” water gauge]
       • Monitor and document results of air flow patterns daily using visual methods
         (e.g., flutter strips, smoke tubes) or a hand held pressure gauge
       • Self-closing door on all room exits
       • Maintain back-up ventilation equipment (e.g., portable units for fans or filters)
         for emergency provision of ventilation requirements for PE areas and take
         immediate steps to restore the fixed ventilation system
       • For patients who require both a PE and Airborne Infection Isolation, use an
         anteroom to ensure proper air balance relationships and provide
         independent exhaust of contaminated air to the outside or place a HEPA
         filter in the exhaust duct. If an anteroom is not available, place patient in an
         AIIR and use portable ventilation units, industrial-grade HEPA filters to
         enhance filtration of spores.

                                                      132
IV. Surfaces
   • Daily wet-dusting of horizontal surfaces using cloths moistened with EPA-
     registered hospital disinfectant/detergent
   • Avoid dusting methods that disperse dust
   • No carpeting in patient rooms or hallways
   • No upholstered furniture and furnishings

V. Other
   • No flowers (fresh or dried) or potted plants in PE rooms or areas
   • Use vacuum cleaner equipped with HEPA filters when vacuum cleaning is
     necessary

                                                  133
