 PURPOSE:

 Because varicella/zoster virus (VZV) can cause serious, potentially devastating disease, particularly in
 immunocompromised children and susceptible adults, it is the policy of CHLA to protect susceptible
 children and staff from VZV.

 SCOPE:

 The policy is applicable to CHLA workforce members

 PROCEDURE:

 Documentation of Status
 Employee Health will obtain written proof of previous varicella disease by a physician, or proof of
 immunization, or proof of protective titers, at the time of the Pre-placement Health Screening. If status is
 unknown, varicella immunization will be offered.

 Varicella Vaccination
 Varicella vaccination will be offered to all susceptible CHLA employees. The employee may elect to
 refuse vaccination and will sign a statement of declination. The employee may at any future date elect to
 have the vaccine.
     1. The varicella vaccine is administered in two doses, at a 4 to 8-week interval. CHLA Employees,
          who have received 2 doses of the vaccine, will be considered immune.
     2. In the event the employee develops a post-vaccination rash, the employee is furloughed with
          regular pay until the lesions are fully dried and crusted.

 Reporting an Exposure
 Varicella exposure is defined as direct contact with or aerosolization of lesion material, or through
 respiratory aerosols from an infectious person.
     1. CHLA Employees must report any significant exposure either in the workplace or outside the
          workplace to Employee Health and their supervisor. Refer to CHLA policy IC - 303 Communicable
          Disease Exposure and IC - 303B Varicella for more details.
     2. If there is a medical contraindication for a susceptible employee to receive the vaccine and
          furlough becomes necessary, they will receive regular pay. Susceptible CHLA employees will be
          furloughed from the 8th through the 21st day after exposure (or up to 28 days if given immune
          globulin).
     3. Those employees who signed a declination for vaccination need to use PTO time to be paid.

          Employees exposed outside of the work environment are not eligible for compensation.
     4. CHLA Employees who develop varicella must remain off duty until all lesions have crusted. As
          with other serious contagious illness, CHLA employees must clear through Employee Health with
          a physician’s note. See CHLA policy IC - 602 CHLA Workforce Communicable Disease Exposures
          for more details.
