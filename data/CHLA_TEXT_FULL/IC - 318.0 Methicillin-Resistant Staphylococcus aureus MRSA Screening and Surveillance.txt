 POLICY NUMBER: IC – 318.0CHLA        CHAPTER: ENTERPRISE – INFECTION CONTROL                                                  PAGE 1 of 2
PURPOSE:

Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a common hospital-acquired infection. According to
California SB 1058, all inpatient hospitals in the state of California are required to screen for Methicillin-
Resistant Staphylococcus aureus upon admission and discharge for high-risk patients. An assessment of
the patient’s admission history and MRSA status will be made at the point of entry to the facility.

PROCEDURE:

      1. One (1) bilateral nares culture or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) will be obtained within
           24 hours of admission for all admitted inpatients. A standing order will automatically be
           generated in KIDS for the MRSA screen.
      2. To conduct a nares culture or PCR, the following steps are taken:
               a. Perform hand hygiene
               b. Put on gloves
               c. Open swab container and remove swab
               d. Place swab one (1) inch inside nares
               e. Swab nares 5 times in a clock-wise motion and 5 times in a counter-clockwise motion
               f. Repeat with the opposite nares using the same swab
               g. Place swab in the culture tube, sealing the cap securely
               h. Perform hand hygiene
               i.   Document culture or PCR in the appropriate section of the patient record.
               j.   Send to lab as quickly as possible.
      3. Reference IC 825 for isolation guidelines for MRSA

Patients identified as high risk who tested negative on the admission screening shall be screened for
MRSA prior to discharge. High Risk groups will be determined based on surveillance data and
recommendation of the Infection Control Committee.

FAMILY NOTIFICATION AND EDUCATION:

      1. The patient’s primary provider is responsible for notifying patients and families of a new
           positive MRSA result as soon as possible.
               a. For inpatients, the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) team will notify the care
                    coordination team (CCA-MDs or CCCs) by e-mail regarding any new MRSA positive
                    patient with a reminder to provide the notification and education to patients and their
                    families.

               b. With assistance from the care coordination team, the patient’s primary provider will
                    provide f a m i l i e s w i t h verbal and written information on MRSA and isolation
                    precautions.
               c.    Materials are available in Attachments A-E of IC Policy 318: Methicillin resistant

               d. The family notification and education should be documented in KIDS by the primary
                    provider.
      2. If a patient’s positive MRSA results are finalized post discharge, the Infection Prevention and
           Control team is responsible for informing the patient/family through a notification letter (See
