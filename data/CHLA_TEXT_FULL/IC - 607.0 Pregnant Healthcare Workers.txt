 PURPOSE:

     The purpose of the following policy is to identify transmission sources of infectious diseases of
     concern to the pregnant HCW and to establish guidelines to determine necessity for work
     reassignment or restriction.

 PROCEDURES:

     Pregnant employees must comply with Standard Precautions and Transmission-based Precautions
     (refer to Policy IC – 220.0 and Policy IC – 301.0). Consistent adherence to these precautions provides
     pregnant HCWs protection from exposure to infections.

     All CHLA employees with questions or concerns related to work restriction or reassignment should
     refer to the attached table.

     Individual consideration or request for accommodation should be addressed through the Unit/
     Divisional/Department Managers and submitted to Human Resources via the Leader Resource
     Center.

Transmission: Because of evidence that the
disease can be transmitted vertically through
the placenta and may cause complications in
pregnancy, pregnant personnel should be
restricted from clinical care of Monkeypox
PUIs and confirmed cases.

 Please see

guidance regarding clinical considerations for
Monkeypox in people who are pregnant.
Transmission: Through direct or droplet contact
from nasopharyngeal secretions; primary sites
of replication are red blood cell precursors
found in bone marrow
