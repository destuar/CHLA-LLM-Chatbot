 POLICY NUMBER: IC – 828.0CHLA        CHAPTER: ENTERPRISE – INFECTION CONTROL                                                  PAGE 1 of 3
PURPOSE:

To outline Infection Prevention and Control measures that will be implemented during all phases of
renovation or construction that takes place in patient care and employee office areas. Implementing
evidence-based containment measures during construction and renovation projects aims to prevent and
mitigate transmission of air and waterborne biological contaminants during construction or renovation
projects.

PROCEDURES:

    A. The Project Manager will be responsible for the initiation of the Infection Prevention Environmental
         process.

    B. The Project Manager and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) team will discuss environmental
         protection measures before any major construction project begins.

    C. For projects that are professionally designed, the Project Manager (architect and/or engineer) shall
         certify that the proposed construction or renovation project was designed in accordance with
         applicable codes and standards.

    D. The Project Manager will first conduct a preliminary risk assessment using the Infection Control
         Risk Assessment (ICRA) Form (see attachment IC - 828.1) to determine if the project warrants
         involvement by the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) team. Construction and renovation not
         taking place in patient care areas, patient common areas, or employee office areas does not need
         oversight by IPC. If results of the preliminary risk assessment indicate the need for IPC oversight, a
         member of the IPC team shall then complete an ICRA form.

    E. The ICRA shall be based on scope and location of the work in order to establish the specific set of
         applicable requirements for infection prevention and control and monitoring throughout
         construction. The ICRA form will be completed by the following steps:

              1. Determine the Construction Activity Type from the following options:
                         a. Type A: Non-Invasive inspection or minor repair work
                         b. Type B: Small-scale, short-duration maintenance, repair and component installation
                            which create minimal dust
                         c. Type C: Work that generates moderate to high levels of dust or requires demolition
                            or removal of any fixed building components or assemblies.
                         d. Type D: Major demolition, renovation and new construction projects.

              2. Identify Infection risk groups:
                         a. Lowest: Office areas
                         b. Medium: Medium Risk Outpatient Clinics (see attachment IC – 828.2), Physical
                            Therapy, Radiology/Imaging, Laboratory, Blood Donor Center
                         c. High: High Risk Outpatient Clinics (see attachment IC - 828.2), Dialysis,
                            Hemodialysis, Emergency Room, Medical/Surgical Units, Pharmacy, Post
                            Anesthesia Care Unit, Duque 6 N Rehab
                         d. Highest: Highest Risk Outpatient Clinics (see attachment IC - 828.2), BMT, 4 East, 4

                            (Ambulatory Surgery Center), Sedation Unit, Radiation Oncology, Operating Rooms

              3. Cross reference the selected Construction Activity Type with the selected Infection Risk
                  group in order to determine the Class of Precautions required (I, II, III, or IV). See Table 1
                  below.

                 Group
                 Low Risk Group               I                   II                       II                       III/IV
                 Medium Risk Group            I                   II                       III                      IV
                 High Risk Group              I                   II                       III/IV                   IV
                 Highest Risk Group           II                  III/IV                   III/IV                   IV

              4. Follow appropriate precaution requirements for resulting project class as listed in the ICRA
                  form (see attachment IC – 828.1).

    F. The Project Manager and IPC team will agree to a routine monitoring schedule of the
         construction/renovation jobs for ICRA Compliance using the IPC Rounding Sheet (see attachment
         IC-828C).
    G. The Project Manager will inform contractors of the Infection Prevention and Control guidelines and
         provide them with the ICRA form.
    H. The managers/unit leaders of the patient care areas involved will be notified by the Project
         manager before work begins on any construction or renovation projects in or adjacent to patient
         care areas in order to establish all necessary and appropriate protective measures.
    I. The IPC team will be informed of problems or project changes as needed.
