 PURPOSE:
          Although soiled linen has been shown to be a source of large numbers of pathogenic organisms,
          the risk of actual disease transmission when laundry is rendered hygienically cleaned is negligible.
          Hygienic approaches for handling and processing procedures are recommended to reduce the risk
          of cross-infection.

          CHLA will contract out with a commercial laundry service that processing linens in compliance
          with CDC and CMS standards.

     1. Soiled linen- Laundry which has been soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials
          or may contain sharps.

               b. All soiled linens will be collected in a manner that minimizes agitation to prevent
                   contamination of the environment and personnel and should be appropriately bagged and
                   securely tied or otherwise closed in fluid-resistant blue bags at the site of use, prior to being
                   transported to the processing area. Staff should not hold contaminated linens/bagged
                   contaminated linen near their own bodies or squeeze them.
