                                               Pertussis Background Information

Modes of Transmission: Pertussis is highly contagious. Contact with respiratory tract secretions or
droplets of infected individuals.

Incubation period: Typically 7-10 days (range 5-21 days)

Period of Communicability: Persons ≥1 year are considered infectious from the onset of cold-like
symptoms until after 5 days of treatment or until 21 days after cough onset, if no (or partial)
treatment is given (6 weeks for infants < 1year)

Clinical Manifestation: The classic symptoms of pertussis include “whoop”, vomiting, apnea, and
cyanosis immediately following a paroxysm of coughing. Infants younger than 6 months may have
an atypical presentation with gagging, gasping or apnea as early manifestations.
