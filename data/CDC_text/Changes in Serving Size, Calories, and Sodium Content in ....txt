Introduction  Approximately  60%  of  the  American  diet  comes  from  processed  foods,
which  makes  improving  their  nutritional  quality  important  for  Americans’  health.  The
objective of this study was to measure changes in serving sizes, calories, and sodium in
top-selling  processed  foods  that  were  on  the  market  in  2009  and  2015.  Methods  We
analyzed  products  in  the  top  80%  of  sales  in  the  54  processed  food  categories  with
consistent serving sizes and sales metrics that were on the market in both 2009 and
2015.  Mean  serving  size,  calories  (per  serving  and  density),  sodium  (per  serving  and
density),  and  sales  were  calculated  for  2,979  branded  processed  food  products.  For
each stratification of calorie density and sodium density (decreased, increased, or did
not change), we calculated the mean serving size, calorie density, sodium density, and
sales  for  each  year.  Results  From  2009  to  2015,  we  found  decreases  in  serving  size
(−2.3%, P < .001), calories per serving (−2.0%, P < .001), calorie density (−1.1%, P <
.001), sodium per serving (−7.6%, P < .001), and sodium density (−6.0%, P < .001). A
decrease in calorie density did not correspond to an increase in sodium density or vice
versa. A decline in sales was observed regardless of whether calorie density or sodium
density decreased, increased, or did not change. Conclusion Reductions in calorie and
sodium  density  occurred  in  tandem,  suggesting  that  manufacturers  reformulated  for
more  than  one  health  goal  at  the  same  time.  Instead  of  unintended  negative
consequences of encouraging companies to reformulate for one nutrient, an overall net

nutritional benefit occurred. Top Diet influences a person’s risk for overweight, obesity,
type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the
leading cause of death in the United States (1). Over-consumption of processed foods
that  contain  empty  calories  from  added  sugars  or  saturated  fats  and  contain  excess
sodium  has  detrimental  health  effects  (1,  2).  Approximately  60%  of  the  calorie  and
sodium  intake  of  adult  Americans  is  from  processed  foods  bought  from  stores  (3,  4).
Despite the focus of public health leaders on changes in the food supply as a strategy
to  influence  the  nutritional  intake  of  Americans,  existing  research  that  monitors  the
nutritional  quality  of  food  is  limited  and  has  typically  focused  on  changes  in  a  single
nutrient or on multiple nutrients at a single point in time. The objective of our study was
to measure changes in serving sizes, calories, and sodium among top-selling processed
foods that were on the market in both 2009 and 2015. A secondary objective was to
assess  whether  a  decrease  in  calorie  density  corresponded  to  an  increase  in  sodium
density  and  vice  versa,  and  whether  those  changes  were  associated  with  changes  in
sales.  Top  We  derived  the  sample  used  for  our  analysis  from  the  National  Salt
Reduction Initiative (NSRI) Packaged Food Database. NSRI is the first organized public
health  effort  in  the  United  States  to  engage  industry  in  reducing  sodium  in  the  food
supply. A coalition of more than 100 local public health agencies and national health
organizations  led  by  the  New  York  City  Department  of  Health  and  Mental  Hygiene
encouraged  food  companies  to  meet  NSRI  sodium  reduction  targets  (5).  The  NSRI
database was designed to assess sodium levels and other information listed on nutrition
labels of US processed foods over time. Monitoring began in January 2009 and occurred
at the deadlines (January 2012 and December 2014) set for companies to voluntarily
meet NSRI sodium reduction targets. The NSRI database profiles nutritional content of
products  in  62  processed  food  categories  that  contribute  to  sodium  intake,  such  as
breads and rolls, cold cuts, and cheese, at 3 points in time. Annual equivalized sales
data were purchased from Nielsen, Inc, for these food categories for 2008, 2011, and

2014. The equivalized sales metric converts the various sizes in which a product is sold
into one standard unit to uniformly quantify the product’s sales volume. We purchased
nutrition  data  from  Guiding  Stars  Licensing  Company  and  collected  it  from
manufacturer websites and supermarkets in 2009, 2012, and 2015 for products in the
top 80% of a food category’s sales in each year. Not all products in the NSRI database
are  included  in  our  analysis.  Nielsen  does  not  provide  product  identifiers  for
private-label  products,  also  known  as  store  brands;  therefore,  nutrition  information
could  be  obtained  only  for  branded  products.  The  number  of  private-label  products
varied by category. In 2015 they accounted for 28% of products in the NSRI database.
In addition, only products in 54 of 62 food categories reported serving sizes in grams
and sales data in equivalized sales, thus allowing for comparisons. Therefore products
in 8 categories were not included in our analysis: 6 categories (Asian-style condiments,
dry soup mixes, vegetable juice, dry seasoning mixes, seasoned pasta and stuffing, and
seasoned grain mixes) reported serving sizes in a volume metric (eg, tablespoons, mL);
one category (uncooked whole muscle meat) did not have unit sales data available; and
one  category  (tortillas  and  wraps)  had  sales  information  in  a  different  metric  (sales
dollars). The remaining 54 food categories span the following broader food categories
or  metacategories:  bakery  products;  cereal  and  other  grain  products;  meats;  dairy
products and substitutes; fats and oils; sauces, dips, gravies, and condiments; snacks;
soups;  potatoes;  mixed  dishes;  vegetables;  legumes;  canned  fish;  and  nut  butters.  A
detailed description of the NSRI processed food categories is published elsewhere (5).
To  focus  on  reformulation  of  the  same  products  over  time,  branded  products  on  the
market in both 2009 and 2015 were matched by universal product codes. The universal
product  code  was  used  to  determine  that  a  product  was  the  same  in  both  years.
Products were included in this analysis only when nutrition information was available in
both years. A total of 2,979 branded products were on the market in 2009 and 2015
and had gram weight, sodium, and calorie information. This sample represents 79% of

all  matched  branded  products  (n  =  3,794),  40%  of  branded  products  in  2009  (n  =
7,509)  and  36%  of  branded  products  in  2015  (8,351).  Mean  serving  size  (grams),
calories per serving, sodium (milligrams) per serving, and sales (equivalized units) were
calculated  for  2009  and  for  2015  for  the  entire  sample  and  by  metacategory.  Mean
calorie and sodium content was calculated per 100 g of food (density) in 2009 and 2015
to  standardize  the  serving  size  to  focus  on  reformulation.  Percentage  change  was
calculated  for  the  entire  sample  and  by  metacategory.  Next,  we  determined  the
number of products in which 4 measures (serving size, calorie density, sodium density,
and  sales)  decreased,  increased,  or  did  not  change.  No  change  was  defined  as  a
percentage change of plus or minus 1% from 2009 to 2015. For each stratification of
calorie  density  and  sodium  density,  the  mean  serving  size,  calorie  density,  sodium
density,  and  sales  were  calculated  in  each  year  along  with  percentage  change.  For
these  analyses,  paired  t  tests  were  used  to  test  whether  the  difference  in  means
between years was significant. To further evaluate whether product reformulation was
associated  with  changes  in  sales,  independent  sample  t  tests  assessed  whether  the
mean difference in sales from 2009 to 2015 was significant between 1) products that
decreased versus increased in calorie density from 2009 to 2015 and 2) products that
decreased  versus  increased  in  sodium  density  from  2009  to  2015.  All  t  tests  used  a
2-tailed α of .05, and all analyses were completed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Inc). Top Mean (standard deviation [SD]) serving size declined significantly by 2.3% (P
< .001) from 93.1 g (85.1) in 2009 to 90.9 g (82.7) in 2015 (Table 1). From 2009 to
2015 serving size decreased among 14% of products (n = 430), increased among 10%
of products (n = 312), and did not change among 75% of products (n = 2,237). There
was  a  significant  reduction  in  mean  calories  in  both  the  per-serving  and  the  density
metrics from 2009 to 2015. Mean calories per serving declined significantly (P < .001)
by  2.0%  (mean  [SD]  kcal,  145.7  [109.5]  in  2009  vs  mean  [SD]  kcal,  142.9  [101.9]  in
2015) (Table 1), and mean (SD) calorie density declined significantly (P < .001) by 1.1%

(234.7 [157.4] kcal/100 g in 2009 vs 232.1 [153.8] kcal/100 g in 2015) (Table 2). Calorie
density  decreased  among  29%  of  products  (n  =  850),  increased  among  22%  of
products (n = 669), and did not change among 49% of products (n = 1,460). Of the 14
metacategories,  2  declined  significantly  in  calorie  density  and  one  increased
significantly  (Table  2).  Products  that  decreased  calorie  density  demonstrated  a
significant 10.3% (P < .001) decline in mean (SD) sodium density, from 614.1 (378.8)
mg/100 g in 2009 to 551.1 (347.2) mg/100 g in 2015. Products that increased or did not
change calorie density had significant declines in mean (SD) sodium density during the
same  period  (Figure  1)  (products  that  increased  calorie  density,  4.2%  decline  [P  <
.001], from 561.3 [345.3] mg/100 g in 2009 to 537.9 [325.1] mg/100 g, in 2015; and
products  that  had  no  change  in  calorie  density,  4.4%  [P  <  .001],  from  641.5  [390.8]
mg/100 g in 2009 to 613.4 [379.3] mg/100 g in 2015).

2,979  processed  food  products,  by  level  of  change  in  calorie  density,  2009  to  2015.
Paired  t  tests  were  used  to  test  whether  the  difference  in  means  between  2009  and
2015  was  significant  (2-tailed  α  of  .05).  All  bars  represent  significant  (P  <  .05)
differences  except  the  leftmost  bar  within  Serving  Size  (the  percentage  change  in
serving size among items that decreased in calorie density). [A tabular version of this
figure is also available.] We also saw a significant reduction in mean sodium in both the
per-serving (Table 1) and the density metrics (Table 2) from 2009 to 2015. Mean (SD)
sodium per serving declined significantly by 7.6% (P < .001; 419.2 [284.1] mg in 2009
to 387.3 [248.5] mg in 2015), and mean (SD) sodium density declined significantly by
6.0% (P < .001; 615.7 [378.8] mg/100 g in 2009 to 578.7 [360.2] mg/100 g in 2015).
Sodium density decreased in 49% of products (n = 1,462), increased in 21% of products
(n  =  612),  and  did  not  change  in  30%  of  products  (n  =  905).  Thirteen  of  the  14

metacategories had significant declines in sodium per serving and sodium density, and
no  metacategories  had  significant  increases  in  sodium  per  serving  or  sodium  density
(Table 1, Table 2). Products that decreased sodium density demonstrated a significant
2.9%  (P  <  .001)  decline  in  mean  (SD)  calorie  density  (Figure  2),  from  224.4  (154.2)
kcal/100  g  in  2009  to  217.8  (146.2)  kcal/100  g  in  2015,  whereas  products  that
increased sodium density had a significant 2.4% (P < .01) increase in mean (SD) calorie
density  during  the  same  period  (216.8  [141.2]  kcal/100  g  in  2009  vs  222.1  [144.0]
kcal/100 g in 2015).

Paired  t  tests  were  used  to  test  whether  the  difference  in  means  between  2009  and
2015 was significant (2-tailed α of .05). All bars represent significant (P
< .05) differences except the leftmost bar in Serving Size (the percentage change in
serving  size  among  items  that  decreased  in  sodium  density)  and  the  rightmost  bars
within  Sodium  Density  and  Sales  (the  percentage  change  in  sodium  density  among
items that did not change in sodium density or sales). [A tabular version of this figure is
also available.] Mean (SD) annual equivalized sales units declined significantly by 5.4%
(P < .001), from 4,397,420.0 (3,591,787) in 2009 to 4,159,564.4 (3,475,658) in 2015.
Sales decreased among 60% of products (n = 1,801), increased among 37% of products
(n  =  1,106)  and  did  not  change  among  2%  of  products  (n  =  72).  Products  that
decreased or increased calorie density demonstrated significant declines in sales units
from 2009 to 2015. For decreases, the decrease was 8.2% (P < .001) (Figure 1); mean
(SD) decrease from 4,307,499.3 (3,609,349) units in 2009 to 3,955,056.7 (3,460,379)
units  in  2015.  For  increases,  the  decrease  was  5.9%  (P  =  .02);  mean  (SD)  decrease
from 4,478,441.1 (3,498,997) units in 2009 to 4,214,948.1 (3,098,732) units in 2015.

Products that decreased or increased sodium density demonstrated significant declines
in  sales  units  from  2009  to  2015.  For  decreases,  the  decrease  was  6.8%  (P  <  .001)
(Figure  2);  mean  (SD)  decrease  from  4,841,548.7  (3,966,836)  units  in  2009  to
4,510,680.7  (3,736,687)  units  in  2015.  For  increases,  the  decrease  was  7.7%  (P  <
.001); mean (SD) decrease from 3,645,839.3 (2,845,116) units in 2009 to 3,364,883.9
(2,506,009.5) in 2015. The mean difference in sales was not significant (P = .53) among
products that decreased versus increased in calorie density (−352,442.7 kcal/100 g for
products  that  decreased  vs  −263,493.0  kcal/100  g  for  products  that  increased).The
difference also was not significant among products that decreased versus increased in
sodium density (P = .66) (−330,868 mg/100 g for products that decreased vs −280,955
mg/100 g for products that increased). Top What people eat and how much they eat
contribute  to  deaths  from  heart  disease,  stroke,  and  type  2  diabetes  (1).  Our  study
found  that  sodium,  calories,  and  serving  size  all  decreased  significantly  among
top-selling  products  on  the  market  from  2009  to  2015.  Calls  for  reformulation  have
raised  concerns  about  the  risk  of  unintended  consequences,  particularly  whether
manufacturers  would  increase  calories  through  the  addition  of  sugar  or  fats  to
compensate for reductions in sodium and vice versa (6). On average, this tradeoff did
not  occur:  a  decrease  in  calorie  density  or  sodium  density  did  not  correspond  to  an
increase  in  the  other.  In  fact,  products  with  reductions  in  calorie  density  also
demonstrated  reductions  in  sodium  density  and  vice  versa.  Instead  of  there  being
unintended  negative  nutritional  consequences  of  companies’  reformulating  for  one
nutrient, a net benefit was observed. That is good news for consumers. Among dietary
factors,  high  sodium  is  estimated  to  be  the  greatest  potential  contributor  to  deaths
because of the role it plays in raising blood pressure and the risk that blood pressure
poses to heart health (1). Sodium density decreased significantly by 6%. If translated
into individual behavior, a consumer who ate the same amount of processed food would
have consumed on average 6% less sodium in 2015 than in 2009. These findings are

consistent  with  results  from  analysis  of  changes  in  a  larger,  nonmatched  sample  of
processed foods in 2009 and 2015 (5).  It may reflect achievements by major processed
food  companies  to  lower  sodium  content  in  products  as  part  of  NSRI.  The  observed
reductions  across  many  metacategories  are  evidence  that  industry  operating  in
different  sectors  can  lower  the  sodium  and  calorie  content  of  products  over  a  5-year
period. In contrast to sodium, calories per serving and calorie density decreased only
modestly (−2% and −1.1%, respectively). Declines in calorie density were smaller and
less  widespread  than  the  changes  we  observed  in  sodium  density  and,  although
significant,  may  reflect  normal  variation  in  product  formulation  over  time.  Greater
declines  were  observed  in  products  in  which  sodium  reduction  also  occurred,  which
indicates that when processed food manufacturers reformulated products, they tackled
key  calorie  contributors  in  addition  to  sodium.  The  limited  changes  in  calorie  density
are more modest than findings from an evaluation of the Healthy Weight Commitment
Foundation, which found substantial reductions in calories in processed foods sold from
2007 to 2012 (7). As part of the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation marketplace
pledge,  16  major  food  and  beverage  companies  committed  to  remove  1.5  trillion
calories  from  the  US  marketplace  from  2007  to  2015  (8).  An  independent  evaluation
found  that  by  2012  these  companies  had  already  exceeded  their  goal  by  more  than
400%  (7).  These  reductions  could  be  attributed  to  a  combination  of  industry-led
strategies,  such  as  introducing  lower-calorie  products,  discontinuing  higher-calorie
products,  changing  package  size,  adjusting  price,  or  reformulating  products,  and  to
independent  consumer  decisions  possibly  related  to  public  health  education.  Our
analysis is more recent, is focused on product reformulation in the same food products
for NSRI categories only, and suggests that reformulation was not a key strategy used
to lower calorie content among food. Continued monitoring will help the industry and
the public health community to understand if progress across foods and beverages is
sustained and which strategies are most enduring. During the time period examined,

changes in serving size were observed in many of the reformulated products. Serving
size was reduced overall with greater declines in products that increased both calorie
density  and  sodium  density.  The  variation  in  serving  size  of  similar  products  or  the
same product over time may make it harder for consumers to gauge other nutritional
differences.   Comparing  labels  for  products  with  different  serving  sizes  can  require
complicated mathematics for the average shopper; it would be ideal if similar products
used the same serving size to make it easier for consumers to compare labels. Because
of  the  variance  of  serving  size  across  similar  products  and  in  amounts  actually
consumed,  it  is  important  for  nutrition  surveillance  to  assess  changes  in  both  the
per-serving  and  density  metrics  to  capture  the  full  picture  of  reformulation.  Sales  of
products decreased overall from 2009 to 2015 (−5.4%), but the decrease in sales was
not disproportionately concentrated among products that decreased calories or sodium.
This is consistent with findings that lower calorie products can drive sales growth for
food  companies  (9).  It  is  also  in  line  with  recent  consumer  research  that  shows  that
shoppers are comparing labels to choose low-sodium products and are cutting back on
high-sodium food (10, 11). These findings are relevant in light of the release of draft
voluntary sodium targets from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a wide range
of foods and the ability of the food industry to follow them while continuing to maintain
product  sales  (6).  The  FDA’s  proposed  2-year  sodium  reduction  targets  are  based  on
sodium levels in 2010, which is one year after the baseline data was collected for our
analysis, suggesting that the findings from this analysis have bearing on the ease with
which  industry  could  meet  the  targets.  Ours  is  one  of  the  first  studies  to  explore
changes  in  key  components  of  US  processed  foods  related  to  health  and  is  a  unique
analysis  of  concurrent  changes  in  serving  size,  calorie  density,  sodium  density,  and
sales.  Tracking  changes  among  the  same  products  that  were  chosen  systematically
based  on  high  sales  at  2  points  in  time  provides  unique  insight  into  the  complex
changes in the food supply. However, our study had limitations. Nutrition data were not

available  for  every  top-selling  product  on  the  market  in  both  2009  and  2015  or  for
private-label  products.  A  recent  study  found  that  sodium,  total  fat,  and  total  sugar
concentrations  do  not  differ  significantly  between  private-label  and  national  food
brands  (12).  Products  sold  through  foodservice  channels,  Walmart,  warehouse-style
retailers, military commissaries, and small stores with less than $2 million annual sales
revenue were not included. Walmart has reported reducing sodium and added sugar in
national brands and in its GreatValue products as it worked towards providing healthier
foods  from  2011  to  2015  (13).  The  absence  of  data  on  private-label  products  and
products  sold  by  Walmart  decreases  the  generalizability  of  our  study  findings.  Our
sample  included  food  categories  that  contribute  to  sodium  intake.  Although  dietary
sodium  intake  comes  from  a  wide  range  of  sources,  not  all  food  categories  were
included; thus, reformulation in some foods (eg, beverages, yogurt, some desserts) was
not  captured.  Finally,  food  companies  could  be  reducing  calorie  density  by  replacing
healthier  fats  with  carbohydrates;  an  analysis  of  macronutrient  composition  of  foods
would be a valuable next step for research. To optimize health, the ideal diet should be
made up primarily of whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and legumes. The reality
is  that  many  Americans  eat  substantial  amounts  of  processed  foods,  and  the  United
States has a large food industry built to meet and foster consumer demand. Improving
the healthfulness of processed food is important given Americans’ reliance on it. Food
producers use a combination of economical ingredients, including sodium, sugar, and
fat,  to  make  food  appealing,  shelf-stable,  and  inexpensive  (14).  Consuming  fewer
calories and less sodium is challenging and requires a shift in food choices and eating
patterns. As the public health community and consumers continue to push for products
that  allow  consumers  the  choice  to  eat  healthfully,  it  remains  critical  to  monitor
changes  in  the  food  supply  to  ensure  that  new  formulations  are  truly  healthier.  The
results of our study show that reductions in calorie density and sodium density occurred
in  tandem,  suggesting  that  manufacturers  can  reformulate  for  more  than  one  health

goal  at  the  same  time.  This  finding  helps  mitigate  the  concern  that  the  benefits  of  a
reduction in one area would be offset by an increase in the other, although this may
vary by food type. Our findings show that food companies can reformulate products to
be  healthier  within  a  5-year  period  without  a  negative  effect  on  sales.  Continued
reductions are necessary to achieve population-wide reductions in sodium intake and
consumption of excess calories, requiring active engagement of the food industry. The
pace  and  scope  of  reduction  must  accelerate  to  improve  population  health.  Top  The
