Summary
The  recommendations  in  this  report  were  developed  to  broaden  the  spectrum  of
antimicrobial agents that are available 
for  treatment  and  postexposure  prophylaxis  of  pertussis.  They  include  updated
information on macrolide agents other 
than erythromycin (azithromycin and clarithromycin) and their dosing schedule by age
group. 

Introduction  
Pertussis is an acute bacterial infection of the respiratory tract that is caused by 
Bordetella pertussis, a gram-negative bacterium (Box 1). 
B. pertussis is a uniquely human pathogen that is transmitted from an infected person
to 
susceptible persons, primarily through aerosolized droplets of respiratory secretions or
by direct contact with respiratory secretions 
from the infected person. 
Disease Burden 
The  Council  of  State  and  Territorial  Epidemiologists  (CSTE)  reviewed  and  approved  a
standard case definition for 
pertussis  in  June  1997  (1,2)  (Box  2).  The  national  pertussis  surveillance  system  is
passive and relies on physicians to report cases 
of pertussis to state and local health departments, which then report cases of pertussis
weekly to the National Notifiable 
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). The reports are transmitted to CDC through the
National Electronic 
Telecommunications  System  for  Surveillance  (NETSS)  and  contain  demographic  data
and supplemental clinical and epidemiologic information 
for each reported pertussis case. 
Despite high childhood vaccination coverage levels for pertussis vaccine 
(3,4), pertussis remains a cause of 
substantial  morbidity  in  the  United  States.  Pertussis  is  the  only  disease  for  which
universal childhood vaccination is recommended 

that  has  an  increasing  trend  in  reported  cases  in  the  United  States.  The  disease  is
endemic in the United States with epidemic 
cycles  every  3--4  years.  In  the  early  vaccine  years  during  1922--1940,  an  average
annual rate of 150 per 100,000 population 
was  reported  (5,6).  After  introduction  of  universal  vaccination  during  the  1940s,  the
incidence of reported pertussis 
declined dramatically to approximately one case per 100,000 population.
During  the  preceding  3  decades,  reports  of  pertussis  steadily  increased  again  in  the
United States, from a nadir of 
1,010  cases  in  1976  (3)  to  25,827  in  2004  (2004  rate:  8.5  cases  per  100,000
population) 
(7);  the  number  of  reported  pertussis  cases  in  2004  was  the  highest  since  1959.
Increased awareness and improved recognition of pertussis among clinicians, greater 
access  to  and  use  of  laboratory  diagnostics  (especially  extensive  polymerase  chain
reaction [PCR] testing), and increased 
surveillance  and  reporting  of  pertussis  by  public  health  departments  could  have
contributed to the increase in reported cases 
(8). Some of the reported increase might constitute a real increase in the incidence of
pertussis 
(9).  Although  infants  have  the  highest  incidence  of  pertussis  of  any  age  group,
adolescents and adults account for the majority of reported cases. 
Clinical Manifestations
The incubation period of pertussis averages 7--10 days (range: 5--21 days) 
(6,10) and has been reported to be as long as 
6  weeks  (11,12).  Pertussis  has  an  insidious  onset  with  catarrhal  symptoms  (nasal

congestion, runny nose, mild sore-throat, 
mild dry cough, and minimal or no fever) that are indistinguishable from those of minor
respiratory tract infections. Some 
infants can have atypical disease and initially have apneic spells and minimal cough or
other respiratory symptoms. The catarrhal 
stage last approximately 1--2 weeks. The cough, which is initially intermittent, becomes
paroxysmal. A typical paroxysm 
is characterized by a succession of coughs that follow each other without inspiration.
Paroxysms terminate in typical cases 
with  inspiratory  "whoop"  and  can  be  followed  by  posttussive  vomiting.  Although
children are often exhausted after a 
coughing paroxysm, they usually appear relatively well between episodes. Paroxysms
of cough usually increase in frequency and 
severity  as  the  illness  progresses  and  usually  persist  for  2--6  weeks.  Paroxysms  can
occur more frequently at night. The illness can 
be milder and the characteristic whoop absent in children, adolescents, and adults who
were previously vaccinated. 
Convalescence  is  gradual  and  protracted.  The  severity  of  illness  wanes,  paroxysms
subside, and the frequency of 
coughing  bouts  decreases.  A  nonparoxysmal  cough  can  continue  for  2--6  weeks  or
longer. During the recovery period, 
superimposed viral respiratory infections can trigger a recurrence of paroxysms. 
Patients with pertussis often have substantial weight loss and sleep disturbance 
(13). Conditions resulting from the effects 
of  the  pressure  generated  by  severe  coughing  include  pneumothorax,  epistaxis,
subconjunctival hemorrhage, subdural 
hematoma, hernia, rectal prolapse, urinary incontinence, and rib fracture 

(14). Some infections are complicated by primary or 
secondary  bacterial  pneumonia  and  otitis  media.  Infrequent  neurologic  complications
include seizures and hypoxic encephalopathy. 
Adolescents  and  adults  with  unrecognized  or  untreated  pertussis  contribute  to  the
reservoir of 
B.  pertussis  in  the  community.  Patients  with  pertussis  are  most  infectious  during  the
catarrhal stage and during the first 3 weeks after cough onset. Pertussis 
is highly infectious; the secondary attack rate exceeds 80% among susceptible persons 
(15,16).  Unvaccinated  or  incompletely  vaccinated  infants  aged  <12  months  have  the
highest risk for severe and life-threatening complications and death 
(5,8,17--25). 
Differential Diagnosis
The  differential  diagnoses  of  pertussis  include  infections  caused  by  other  etiologic
agents, including adenoviruses, 
respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and other 
Bordetella species such as B.  
parapertussis, and rarely B. bronchoseptica 
(26) or  B. holmseii (27). Despite increasing awareness and recognition of pertussis as a
disease that 
affects  adolescents  and  adults,  pertussis  is  overlooked  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of
cough illness in this population 
(28).  
Prevention

Vaccination  of  susceptible  persons  is  the  most  important  preventive  strategy  against
pertussis. Universal childhood 
pertussis vaccine recommendations have been implemented since the mid-1940s. For
protection against pertussis during childhood, 
the  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization  Practices  (ACIP)  recommends  5  doses  of
diphtheria and tetanus toxoid and 
acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6, 15--18 months, and 4--6 years 
(29). Childhood vaccination coverage for 
pertussis vaccines has been at an all-time high 
(4). However, neither vaccination nor natural disease confers complete or 
lifelong  protective  immunity  against  pertussis  or  reinfection.  Immunity  wanes  after
5--10 years from the last pertussis vaccine 
dose  (3,8,30--34).  Older  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  can  become  susceptible  to
pertussis after a complete course 
of vaccination during childhood. 
During spring of 2005, two Tetanus Toxoid and Reduced Diphtheria Toxoid and Acellular
Pertussis vaccines 
adsorbed  (Tdap)  formulated  for  adolescents  and  adults  were  licensed  in  the  United
States 
(BOOSTRIX®, GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium and ADACEL, Sanofi Pasteur, Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
ACIP voted to recommend a single dose 
of Tdap for adolescents aged 11--18 years in June 2005 and adults aged 19--64 years in
October 2005.
Treatment of Pertussis

Maintaining  high  vaccination  coverage  rates  among  preschool  children,  adolescents,
and adults and minimizing exposures 
of  infants  and  persons  at  high  risk  for  pertussis  is  the  most  effective  way  to  prevent
pertussis. Antibiotic treatment of 
pertussis  and  judicious  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  for  postexposure  prophylaxis  will
eradicate 
B. pertussis from the nasopharynx of 
infected persons (symptomatic or asymptomatic). A macrolide administered early in the
course of illness can reduce 
the duration and severity of symptoms and lessen the period of communicability 
(35). Approximately 80%--90% of patients 
with untreated pertussis will spontaneously clear 
B. pertussis from the nasopharynx within 3--4 weeks from onset of cough 
(36); however, untreated and unvaccinated infants can remain culture-positive for >6
weeks 
(37). Close asymptomatic contacts 
(38) (Box 3) can be administered postexposure chemoprophylaxis to prevent secondary
cases; symptomatic contacts should 
be treated as cases.  
Erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, has been the antimicrobial of choice for treatment
or postexposure prophylaxis 
of  pertussis.  It  is  usually  administered  in  4  divided  daily  doses  for  14  days.  Although
effective for treatment (Table 1) 
and
 postexposure
 prophylaxis
 (Table
 2),
 erythromycin
 is
 accompanied
 by
uncomfortable to distressing side effects that result 

in  poor  adherence  to  the  treatment  regimen.  During  the  last  decade,  in  vitro  studies
have demonstrated the effectiveness 
against B. pertussis of two other macrolide agents (azithromycin and clarithromycin) 
(57--64). Results from in vitro studies
are not always replicated in clinical studies and practice. A literature search and review
was conducted for in vivo studies and 
clinical  trials  that  were  conducted  during  1970--2004  and  used  clarithromycin  or
azithromycin for the treatment and prophylaxis 
of  pertussis  (Table  3).  On  the  basis  of  this  review,  guidelines  were  developed  to
broaden the spectrum of macrolide 
agents  available  for  pertussis  treatment  and  postexposure  prophylaxis  and  are
presented in this report to update previous 
CDC
 recommendations
 (71).
 Treatment
 and
 postexposure
 prophylaxis
recommendations are made on the basis of existing 
scientific evidence and theoretical rationale.  
Recommendations
I. General Principles
A. Treatment. The macrolide agents erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin are
preferred for the treatment 
of  pertussis  in  persons  aged  >1  month.  For  infants  aged  <1  month,  azithromycin  is
preferred; erythromycin and 
clarithromycin are not recommended. For treatment of persons aged 
>2 months, an alternative agent to macrolides is 

trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP--SMZ) (Table 4). 
The  choice  of  antimicrobial  for  treatment  or  prophylaxis  should  take  into  account
effectiveness, safety (including 
the potential for adverse events and drug interactions), tolerability, ease of adherence
to the regimen prescribed, and 
cost. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are as effective as erythromycin for treatment of
pertussis in persons aged 
>6 months, are better tolerated, and are associated with fewer and milder side effects
than erythromycin. Erythromycin and 
clarithromycin,  but  not  azithromycin,  are  inhibitors  of  the  cytochrome  P450  enzyme
system (CYP3A subclass) and can interact with 
other drugs that are metabolized by this system. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are
more resistant to gastric acid, achieve 
higher  tissue  concentrations,  and  have  a  longer  half-life  than  erythromycin,  allowing
less frequent administration (1--2 doses per 
day) and shorter treatment regimens (5--7 days). Erythromycin is available as generic
preparations and is considerably less 
expensive than azithromycin and clarithromycin. 
B. Postexposure prophylaxis. A macrolide can be administered as prophylaxis for close
contacts of a person with 
pertussis  if  the  person  has  no  contraindication  to  its  use.  The  decision  to  administer
postexposure chemoprophylaxis is made 
after considering the infectiousness of the patient and the intensity of the exposure, the
potential consequences of severe pertussis 
in the contact, and possibilities for secondary exposure of persons at high risk from the
contact (e.g., infants aged <12 
months). For postexposure prophylaxis, the benefits of administering an antimicrobial

agent to reduce the risk for pertussis and 
its complications should be weighed against the potential adverse effects of the drug.
Administration of postexposure 
prophylaxis  to  asymptomatic  household  contacts  within  21  days  of  onset  of  cough  in
the index patient can prevent symptomatic 
infection. Coughing (symptomatic) household members of a pertussis patient should be
treated as if they have pertussis. Because 
severe and sometimes fatal pertussis-related complications occur in infants aged <12
months, especially among infants aged 
<4 months, postexposure prophylaxis should be administered in exposure settings that
include infants aged <12 months 
or women in the third trimester of pregnancy. The recommended antimicrobial agents
and dosing regimens for 
postexposure prophylaxis are the same as those for treatment of pertussis (Table 4). 
C.  Special  considerations  for  infants  aged  <6  months  when  using  macrolides  for
treatment or 
postexposure  prophylaxis.  The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  has  not
licensed any macrolide for use in infants aged 
<6  months.  Data  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  azithromycin  and  clarithromycin  use
among infants aged <6 months are 
limited.  
Data  from  subsets  of  infants  aged  1--5  months  (enrolled  in  small  clinical  studies)
suggest similar microbiologic 
effectiveness of azithromycin and clarithromycin against pertussis as with older infants
and children. If not treated, infants with 
pertussis remain culture-positive for longer periods than older children and adults 
(36,72). These limited data support the use 

of azithromycin and clarithromycin as first-line agents among infants aged 1--5 months,
based on their in vitro 
effectiveness against B. pertussis, their demonstrated safety and effectiveness in older
children and adults, and more convenient 
dosing schedule. 
For  treatment  of  pertussis  among  infants  aged  <1  month  (neonates),  no  data  are
available on the effectiveness 
of azithromycin and clarithromycin. Abstracts and published case series describing use
of azithromycin among infants aged 
<1 month report fewer adverse events compared with erythromycin 
(73); to date, use of azithromycin in infants aged <1 
month  has  not  been  associated  with  infantile  hypertrophic  pyloric  stenosis  (IHPS).
Therefore, for pertussis, azithromycin is 
the preferred macrolide for postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of infants aged <1
month. In this age group, the risk 
for  acquiring  severe  pertussis  and  its  life-threatening  complications  outweigh  the
potential risk for IHPS that has been 
associated  with  erythromycin  (74).  Infants  aged  <1  month  who  receive  a  macrolide
should be monitored for IHPS and other 
serious adverse events.
D.  Safety.  A  comprehensive  description  of  the  safety  of  the  recommended
antimicrobials is available in the package 
insert, or in the latest edition of the Red Book: Pharmacy's 
Fundamental Reference. A macrolide is contraindicated if there is history 
of  hypersensitivity  to  any  macrolide  agent  (Table  5).  Neither  erythromycin  nor
clarithromycin should be 
administered  concomitantly  with  astemizole,  cisapride,  pimazole,  or  terfenadine.  The

most commonly reported side effects of 
oral  macrolides  are  gastrointestinal  (e.g.,  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain  and
cramps, diarrhea, and anorexia) and rashes; 
side effects are more frequent and severe with erythromycin use. 
II. Specific Antimicrobial Agents
1. Azithromycin. Azithromycin is available in the United States for oral administration as
azithromycin 
dihydrate (suspension, tablets, and capsules). It is administered as a single daily dose.
Recommended regimen:
Infants aged <6 months: 10 mg/kg per day for 5 days.
Infants and children aged 
>6 months: 10 mg/kg (maximum: 500 mg) on day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg per day 
(maximum: 250 mg) on days 2--5.
Adults: 500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg per day on days 2--5. 
Side  effects  include  abdominal  discomfort  or  pain,  diarrhea,  nausea,  vomiting,
headache,  and  dizziness.  Azithromycin  should  be  prescribed  with  caution  to  patients
with impaired hepatic function. All patients should be cautioned not to 
take  azithromycin  and  aluminum-  or  magnesium-containing  antacids  simultaneously
because the latter reduces the rate 
of  absorption  of  azithromycin.  Monitoring  of  patients  is  advised  when  azithromycin  is
used concomitantly with 
agents metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and with other drugs for
which the pharmacokinetics change 
(e.g.,  digoxin,  triazolam,  and  ergot  alkaloids).  Drug  interactions  reactions  similar  to

those observed for erythromycin 
and  clarithromycin  have  not  been  reported.  Azithromycin  is  classified  as  an  FDA
Pregnancy Category B drug 
(75).  
 
2. Erythromycin. Erythromycin is available in the United States for oral administration
as erythromycin base (tablets 
and  capsules),  erythromycin  stearate  (tablets),  and  erythromycin  ethylsuccinate
(tablets, powders, and liquids). 
Because relapses have been reported after completion of 7--10 days of treatment with
erythromycin, a 14-day course 
of  erythromycin  is  recommended  for  treatment  of  patients  with  pertussis  or  for
postexposure prophylaxis of close contacts 
of pertussis patients (76). 
Recommended regimen:
Infants  aged  <1  month:  not  preferred  because  of  risk  for  IHPS.  Azithromycin  is  the
recommended antimicrobial agent. 
If azithromycin is unavailable and erythromycin is used, the dose is 40--50 mg/kg per
day in 4 divided doses. These 
infants should be monitored for IHPS.
Infants aged >1 month and older children: 40--50 mg/kg per day (maximum: 2 g per
day) in 4 divided doses for 14 days. 

Adults: 2 g per day in 4 divided doses for 14 days
Gastrointestinal  irritation,  including  epigastric  distress,  abdominal  cramps,  nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea, are the 
most  common  adverse  effects  associated  with  oral  administration  of  erythromycin.
Symptoms are dose-related. Some 
formulations with enteric-coated tablets and the ester derivatives (e.g., ethylsuccinate)
can be taken with food to minimize these side 
effects.  Hypersensitivity  reactions  (e.g.,  skin  rashes,  drug  fever,  or  eosinophilia),
cholestatic hepatitis, and sensorineural hearing 
loss  have  occurred  after  administration  of  macrolides;  severe  reactions  such  as
anaphylaxis are rare.
An  increased  risk  for  IHPS  has  been  reported  in  neonates  during  the  month  after
erythromycin administration. In one 
case,  pyloric  stenosis  occurred  in  a  breastfeeding  infant  whose  mother  took
erythromycin. In 1999, a cluster of seven cases of 
IHPS were reported among neonates (all aged <3 weeks when prophylaxis was started)
who had taken erythromycin after 
exposure  to  a  pertussis  patient.  In  a  cohort  study,  erythromycin  prophylaxis  was
causally associated with IHPS (seven cases out of 
157  erythromycin  exposed  infants  versus  zero  cases  out  of  125  infants  with  no
erythromycin exposure (relative risk: infinity 
[95% confidence interval = 1.7--infinity]). 
The  high  case-fatality  ratio  of  pertussis  in  neonates  underscores  the  importance  of
preventing pertussis among 
exposed  infants.  Health-care  providers  who  prescribe  erythromycin  rather  than
azithromycin to newborns should inform parents 

about the possible risks for IHPS and counsel them about signs of IHPS.
Erythromycin is contraindicated if there is history of hypersensitivity to any macrolide 
agent.  Erythromycin  should  not  be  administered  concomitantly  with  astemizole,
cisapride, pimazole, or terfenadine. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular 
adverse events, including electrocardiographic 
QT/QTc interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other 
ventricular  arrhythmias,  have  been  observed  after  concomitant  use  of  erythromycin
with these drugs.
Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system (CYP3A subclass).
Coadministration of 
erythromycin and a drug that is primarily metabolized by CYP3A can result in elevations
in drug concentrations that could increase 
or  prolong  both  the  therapeutic  and  adverse  effects  of  the  concomitant  drug.  Drugs
that are metabolized by CYP3A 
include
 alfentanil,
 bromocriptine,
 cyclosporine,
 carbamazepine,
 cilostazol,
disopyramide, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, 
lovastatin  and  simvastatin,  methylprednisolone,  quinidine,  rifabutin,  vinblastine,
tacrolimus, triazolo-benzodiazepines (e.g., 
triazolam  and  alprazolam)  and  related  benzodiazepines,  and  sildenafil.   In  addition,
reports exists of drug interactions of 
erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including zidovudine,
hexobarbital, phenytoin, and 
valproate, theophylline, digoxin, and oral anticoagulants. 
Erythromycin is classified as an FDA Pregnancy Category B drug 
(76). Animal reproduction studies have failed 
to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, but no adequate or well-controlled studies in humans
exist.

3. Clarithromycin. Clarithromycin is available in the United States for oral administration
as granules for oral 
suspension and tablets. 
Recommended regimen:
Infants aged <1 month: not recommended. 
Infants and children aged 
>1 month: 15 mg/kg per day (maximum: 1 g per day) in 2 divided doses each day for 7
days.
Adults: 1 g per day in two divided doses for 7 days. 
The  most  common  adverse  effects  associated  with  clarithromycin  include  epigastric
distress, abdominal cramps, 
nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhea.  Hypersensitivity  reactions  (e.g.,  skin  rashes,  drug
fever, or eosinophilia), hepatotoxicity, and 
severe reactions such as anaphylaxis are rare. Because of its similarity to erythromycin,
both chemically and 
metabolically,  clarithromycin  should  not  be  administered  to  infants  aged  <1  month
because it is unknown if the drug can be 
similarly  associated  with  IHPS.  The  drug  is  contraindicated  if  there  is  history  of
hypersensitivity to any macrolide agent. Similar 
to  erythromycin,  clarithromycin  should  not  be  administered  concomitantly  with
astemizole, cisapride, pimazole, or 
terfenadine.  Clarithromycin  inhibits  the  cytochrome  P450  enzyme  system  (CYP3A
subclass), and coadministration of clarithromycin 

and  a  drug  that  is  primarily  metabolized  by  CYP3A  can  result  in  elevations  in  drug
concentrations that could increase or 
prolong  both  the  therapeutic  and  adverse  effects  of  the  concomitant  drug.
Clarithromycin can be administered without 
dosage  adjustment  in  patients  with  impaired  hepatic  function  and  normal  renal
function; however, drug dosage and interval 
between  doses  should  be  reassessed  in  the  presence  of  impaired  renal  function.
Clarithromycin is classified by FDA as a 
Pregnancy Category C drug (76). Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse
effect on the fetus; no adequate or 
well-controlled studies in humans exist. 
4.  Alternate  agent  (TMP--SMZ).  Data  from  clinical  studies  indicate  that  TMP--SMZ  is
effective in eradicating 
B. pertussis from the nasopharynx 
(64,77,78).  TMP--SMZ  is  used  as  an  alternative  to  a  macrolide  antibiotic  in  patients
aged 
>2 months who have contraindication to or cannot tolerate macrolide agents, or who
are infected with a macrolide-resistant strain of 
B. pertussis. Macrolide-resistant B. 
pertussis is rare. Because of the potential risk for kernicterus among infants, 
TMP--SMZ should not be administered to pregnant women, nursing mothers, or infants
aged <2 months.
Recommended regimen (79):
Infants aged <2 months: contraindicated.

Infants aged >2 months and children: trimethoprim 8 mg/kg per day, sulfamethoxazole
40 mg/kg per day in 2 
divided doses for 14 days.
Adults: trimethoprim 320 mg per day, sulfamethoxazole 1,600 mg per day in 2 divided
doses for 14 days.
Patients  receiving  TMP-SMZ  might  experience  gastrointestinal  adverse  effects,
hypersensitivity skin reactions, and 
rarely,  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome,  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis,  blood  dyscrasias,  and
hepatic necrosis. TMP--SMZ is 
contraindicated  if  there  is  known  hypersensitivity  to  trimethoprim  or  sulfonamides.
TMP--SMZ should be prescribed with caution to 
patients with impaired hepatic and renal functions, folate deficiency, blood dyscrasias,
and in older adults because of the 
higher  incidence  of  severe  adverse  events.  Patients  taking  TMP--SMZ  should  be
instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake 
to  prevent  crystalluria  and  renal  stones.  Drug  interactions  must  be  considered  when
TMP--SMZ is used concomitantly 
with  drugs,  including  methotrexate,  oral  anticoagulants,  antidiabetic  agents,  thiazide
diuretics, anticonvulsants, and 
other  antiretroviral  drugs.  TMP--SMZ  is  classified  by  FDA  as  a  Pregnancy  Category  C
drug 
(76).  Animal  reproduction  studies  have  indicated  an  adverse  effect  on  the  fetus;  no
adequate or well-controlled studies in humans exist. 
5. Other antimicrobial agents. Although in vitro activity against 
B. pertussis has been demonstrated for other 
macrolides such as roxithromycin and ketolides (e.g., telithromycin) 

(60), no published data exist on the clinical effectiveness of 
these agents. 
Other
 antimicrobial
 agents
 such
 as
 ampicillin,
 amoxicillin,
 tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones 
(e.g.,  ciprofloxacin,  levofloxacin,  ofloxacin,   moxifloxacin),  and  cephalosporins  exhibit
various levels of in 
vitro inhibitory activity against B. 
pertussis,  but  in  vitro  inhibitory  activity  does  not  predict  clinical  effectiveness.  The
clinical effectiveness of 
these agents for treatment of pertussis has not been demonstrated. For example, both
ampicillin and amoxicillin were ineffective 
in clearing B. pertussis from nasopharynx 
(80). Poor penetration into respiratory secretions was proposed as a possible 
mechanism for failure to clear B. pertussis 
from the nasopharynx (81). The minimum inhibitory concentration of 
B. pertussis to the cephalosporins is unacceptably high 
(82). In addition, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and fluoroquinolones have 
potentially harmful side effects in children. Therefore, none of the above antimicrobial
agents are recommended for treatment 
or postexposure prophylaxis of pertussis.

Introduction  
 Pertussis is an acute bacterial infection of the respiratory tract that is caused by 
Bordetella pertussis, a gram-negative bacterium (Box 1). 

B. pertussis is a uniquely human pathogen that is transmitted from an infected person
to 
susceptible persons, primarily through aerosolized droplets of respiratory secretions or
by direct contact with respiratory secretions 
from the infected person. 
Disease Burden 
 The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) reviewed and approved a
standard case definition for 
pertussis  in  June  1997  (1,2)  (Box  2).  The  national  pertussis  surveillance  system  is
passive and relies on physicians to report cases 
of pertussis to state and local health departments, which then report cases of pertussis
weekly to the National Notifiable 
Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). The reports are transmitted to CDC through the
National Electronic 
Telecommunications  System  for  Surveillance  (NETSS)  and  contain  demographic  data
and supplemental clinical and epidemiologic information 
for each reported pertussis case. 
 Despite high childhood vaccination coverage levels for pertussis vaccine 
(3,4), pertussis remains a cause of 
substantial  morbidity  in  the  United  States.  Pertussis  is  the  only  disease  for  which
universal childhood vaccination is recommended 
that  has  an  increasing  trend  in  reported  cases  in  the  United  States.  The  disease  is
endemic in the United States with epidemic 
cycles  every  3--4  years.  In  the  early  vaccine  years  during  1922--1940,  an  average
annual rate of 150 per 100,000 population 

was  reported  (5,6).  After  introduction  of  universal  vaccination  during  the  1940s,  the
incidence of reported pertussis 
declined dramatically to approximately one case per 100,000 population.
 During the preceding 3 decades, reports of pertussis steadily increased again in the
United States, from a nadir of 
1,010  cases  in  1976  (3)  to  25,827  in  2004  (2004  rate:  8.5  cases  per  100,000
population) 
(7);  the  number  of  reported  pertussis  cases  in  2004  was  the  highest  since  1959.
Increased awareness and improved recognition of pertussis among clinicians, greater 
access  to  and  use  of  laboratory  diagnostics  (especially  extensive  polymerase  chain
reaction [PCR] testing), and increased 
surveillance  and  reporting  of  pertussis  by  public  health  departments  could  have
contributed to the increase in reported cases 
(8). Some of the reported increase might constitute a real increase in the incidence of
pertussis 
(9).  Although  infants  have  the  highest  incidence  of  pertussis  of  any  age  group,
adolescents and adults account for the majority of reported cases. 
Clinical Manifestations
 The incubation period of pertussis averages 7--10 days (range: 5--21 days) 
(6,10) and has been reported to be as long as 
6  weeks  (11,12).  Pertussis  has  an  insidious  onset  with  catarrhal  symptoms  (nasal
congestion, runny nose, mild sore-throat, 
mild dry cough, and minimal or no fever) that are indistinguishable from those of minor
respiratory tract infections. Some 
infants can have atypical disease and initially have apneic spells and minimal cough or

other respiratory symptoms. The catarrhal 
stage last approximately 1--2 weeks. The cough, which is initially intermittent, becomes
paroxysmal. A typical paroxysm 
is characterized by a succession of coughs that follow each other without inspiration.
Paroxysms terminate in typical cases 
with  inspiratory  "whoop"  and  can  be  followed  by  posttussive  vomiting.  Although
children are often exhausted after a 
coughing paroxysm, they usually appear relatively well between episodes. Paroxysms
of cough usually increase in frequency and 
severity  as  the  illness  progresses  and  usually  persist  for  2--6  weeks.  Paroxysms  can
occur more frequently at night. The illness can 
be milder and the characteristic whoop absent in children, adolescents, and adults who
were previously vaccinated. 
 Convalescence  is  gradual  and  protracted.  The  severity  of  illness  wanes,  paroxysms
subside, and the frequency of 
coughing  bouts  decreases.  A  nonparoxysmal  cough  can  continue  for  2--6  weeks  or
longer. During the recovery period, 
superimposed viral respiratory infections can trigger a recurrence of paroxysms. 
 Patients with pertussis often have substantial weight loss and sleep disturbance 
(13). Conditions resulting from the effects 
of  the  pressure  generated  by  severe  coughing  include  pneumothorax,  epistaxis,
subconjunctival hemorrhage, subdural 
hematoma, hernia, rectal prolapse, urinary incontinence, and rib fracture 
(14). Some infections are complicated by primary or 
secondary  bacterial  pneumonia  and  otitis  media.  Infrequent  neurologic  complications
include seizures and hypoxic encephalopathy. 
 Adolescents  and  adults  with  unrecognized  or  untreated  pertussis  contribute  to  the

reservoir of 
B.  pertussis  in  the  community.  Patients  with  pertussis  are  most  infectious  during  the
catarrhal stage and during the first 3 weeks after cough onset. Pertussis 
is highly infectious; the secondary attack rate exceeds 80% among susceptible persons 
(15,16).  Unvaccinated  or  incompletely  vaccinated  infants  aged  <12  months  have  the
highest risk for severe and life-threatening complications and death 
(5,8,17--25). 
Differential Diagnosis
 The  differential  diagnoses  of  pertussis  include  infections  caused  by  other  etiologic
agents, including adenoviruses, 
respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and other 
Bordetella species such as B.  
parapertussis, and rarely B. bronchoseptica 
(26) or  B. holmseii (27). Despite increasing awareness and recognition of pertussis as a
disease that 
affects  adolescents  and  adults,  pertussis  is  overlooked  in  the  differential  diagnosis  of
cough illness in this population 
(28).  
Prevention
 Vaccination of susceptible persons is the most important preventive strategy against
pertussis. Universal childhood 
pertussis vaccine recommendations have been implemented since the mid-1940s. For

protection against pertussis during childhood, 
the  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization  Practices  (ACIP)  recommends  5  doses  of
diphtheria and tetanus toxoid and 
acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine at ages 2, 4, 6, 15--18 months, and 4--6 years 
(29). Childhood vaccination coverage for 
pertussis vaccines has been at an all-time high 
(4). However, neither vaccination nor natural disease confers complete or 
lifelong  protective  immunity  against  pertussis  or  reinfection.  Immunity  wanes  after
5--10 years from the last pertussis vaccine 
dose  (3,8,30--34).  Older  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  can  become  susceptible  to
pertussis after a complete course 
of vaccination during childhood. 
 During  spring  of  2005,  two  Tetanus  Toxoid  and  Reduced  Diphtheria  Toxoid  and
Acellular Pertussis vaccines 
adsorbed  (Tdap)  formulated  for  adolescents  and  adults  were  licensed  in  the  United
States 
(BOOSTRIX®, GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium and ADACEL, Sanofi Pasteur, Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
ACIP voted to recommend a single dose 
of Tdap for adolescents aged 11--18 years in June 2005 and adults aged 19--64 years in
October 2005.
Treatment of Pertussis
 Maintaining  high  vaccination  coverage  rates  among  preschool  children,  adolescents,
and adults and minimizing exposures 
of  infants  and  persons  at  high  risk  for  pertussis  is  the  most  effective  way  to  prevent

pertussis. Antibiotic treatment of 
pertussis  and  judicious  use  of  antimicrobial  agents  for  postexposure  prophylaxis  will
eradicate 
B. pertussis from the nasopharynx of 
infected persons (symptomatic or asymptomatic). A macrolide administered early in the
course of illness can reduce 
the duration and severity of symptoms and lessen the period of communicability 
(35). Approximately 80%--90% of patients 
with untreated pertussis will spontaneously clear 
B. pertussis from the nasopharynx within 3--4 weeks from onset of cough 
(36); however, untreated and unvaccinated infants can remain culture-positive for >6
weeks 
(37). Close asymptomatic contacts 
(38) (Box 3) can be administered postexposure chemoprophylaxis to prevent secondary
cases; symptomatic contacts should 
be treated as cases.  
 Erythromycin,  a  macrolide  antibiotic,  has  been  the  antimicrobial  of  choice  for
treatment or postexposure prophylaxis 
of  pertussis.  It  is  usually  administered  in  4  divided  daily  doses  for  14  days.  Although
effective for treatment (Table 1) 
and
 postexposure
 prophylaxis
 (Table
 2),
 erythromycin
 is
 accompanied
 by
uncomfortable to distressing side effects that result 
in  poor  adherence  to  the  treatment  regimen.  During  the  last  decade,  in  vitro  studies
have demonstrated the effectiveness 
against B. pertussis of two other macrolide agents (azithromycin and clarithromycin) 
(57--64). Results from in vitro studies

are not always replicated in clinical studies and practice. A literature search and review
was conducted for in vivo studies and 
clinical  trials  that  were  conducted  during  1970--2004  and  used  clarithromycin  or
azithromycin for the treatment and prophylaxis 
of  pertussis  (Table  3).  On  the  basis  of  this  review,  guidelines  were  developed  to
broaden the spectrum of macrolide 
agents  available  for  pertussis  treatment  and  postexposure  prophylaxis  and  are
presented in this report to update previous 
CDC
 recommendations
 (71).
 Treatment
 and
 postexposure
 prophylaxis
recommendations are made on the basis of existing 
scientific evidence and theoretical rationale.  
Recommendations
I. General Principles
 A.  Treatment.  The  macrolide  agents  erythromycin,  clarithromycin,  and  azithromycin
are preferred for the treatment 
of  pertussis  in  persons  aged  >1  month.  For  infants  aged  <1  month,  azithromycin  is
preferred; erythromycin and 
clarithromycin are not recommended. For treatment of persons aged 
>2 months, an alternative agent to macrolides is 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP--SMZ) (Table 4). 
 The  choice  of  antimicrobial  for  treatment  or  prophylaxis  should  take  into  account
effectiveness, safety (including 
the potential for adverse events and drug interactions), tolerability, ease of adherence

to the regimen prescribed, and 
cost. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are as effective as erythromycin for treatment of
pertussis in persons aged 
>6 months, are better tolerated, and are associated with fewer and milder side effects
than erythromycin. Erythromycin and 
clarithromycin,  but  not  azithromycin,  are  inhibitors  of  the  cytochrome  P450  enzyme
system (CYP3A subclass) and can interact with 
other drugs that are metabolized by this system. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are
more resistant to gastric acid, achieve 
higher  tissue  concentrations,  and  have  a  longer  half-life  than  erythromycin,  allowing
less frequent administration (1--2 doses per 
day) and shorter treatment regimens (5--7 days). Erythromycin is available as generic
preparations and is considerably less 
expensive than azithromycin and clarithromycin. 
 B. Postexposure prophylaxis. A macrolide can be administered as prophylaxis for close
contacts of a person with 
pertussis  if  the  person  has  no  contraindication  to  its  use.  The  decision  to  administer
postexposure chemoprophylaxis is made 
after considering the infectiousness of the patient and the intensity of the exposure, the
potential consequences of severe pertussis 
in the contact, and possibilities for secondary exposure of persons at high risk from the
contact (e.g., infants aged <12 
months). For postexposure prophylaxis, the benefits of administering an antimicrobial
agent to reduce the risk for pertussis and 
its complications should be weighed against the potential adverse effects of the drug.
Administration of postexposure 
prophylaxis  to  asymptomatic  household  contacts  within  21  days  of  onset  of  cough  in

the index patient can prevent symptomatic 
infection. Coughing (symptomatic) household members of a pertussis patient should be
treated as if they have pertussis. Because 
severe and sometimes fatal pertussis-related complications occur in infants aged <12
months, especially among infants aged 
<4 months, postexposure prophylaxis should be administered in exposure settings that
include infants aged <12 months 
or women in the third trimester of pregnancy. The recommended antimicrobial agents
and dosing regimens for 
postexposure prophylaxis are the same as those for treatment of pertussis (Table 4). 
 C.  Special  considerations  for  infants  aged  <6  months  when  using  macrolides  for
treatment or 
postexposure  prophylaxis.  The  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  has  not
licensed any macrolide for use in infants aged 
<6  months.  Data  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  azithromycin  and  clarithromycin  use
among infants aged <6 months are 
limited.  
 Data  from  subsets  of  infants  aged  1--5  months  (enrolled  in  small  clinical  studies)
suggest similar microbiologic 
effectiveness of azithromycin and clarithromycin against pertussis as with older infants
and children. If not treated, infants with 
pertussis remain culture-positive for longer periods than older children and adults 
(36,72). These limited data support the use 
of azithromycin and clarithromycin as first-line agents among infants aged 1--5 months,
based on their in vitro 
effectiveness against B. pertussis, their demonstrated safety and effectiveness in older
children and adults, and more convenient 

dosing schedule. 
 For  treatment  of  pertussis  among  infants  aged  <1  month  (neonates),  no  data  are
available on the effectiveness 
of azithromycin and clarithromycin. Abstracts and published case series describing use
of azithromycin among infants aged 
<1 month report fewer adverse events compared with erythromycin 
(73); to date, use of azithromycin in infants aged <1 
month  has  not  been  associated  with  infantile  hypertrophic  pyloric  stenosis  (IHPS).
Therefore, for pertussis, azithromycin is 
the preferred macrolide for postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of infants aged <1
month. In this age group, the risk 
for  acquiring  severe  pertussis  and  its  life-threatening  complications  outweigh  the
potential risk for IHPS that has been 
associated  with  erythromycin  (74).  Infants  aged  <1  month  who  receive  a  macrolide
should be monitored for IHPS and other 
serious adverse events.
 D.  Safety.  A  comprehensive  description  of  the  safety  of  the  recommended
antimicrobials is available in the package 
insert, or in the latest edition of the Red Book: Pharmacy's 
Fundamental Reference. A macrolide is contraindicated if there is history 
of  hypersensitivity  to  any  macrolide  agent  (Table  5).  Neither  erythromycin  nor
clarithromycin should be 
administered  concomitantly  with  astemizole,  cisapride,  pimazole,  or  terfenadine.  The
most commonly reported side effects of 
oral  macrolides  are  gastrointestinal  (e.g.,  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain  and
cramps, diarrhea, and anorexia) and rashes; 
side effects are more frequent and severe with erythromycin use. 

II. Specific Antimicrobial Agents
 1. Azithromycin. Azithromycin is available in the United States for oral administration
as azithromycin 
dihydrate (suspension, tablets, and capsules). It is administered as a single daily dose.
 Recommended regimen:
 2. Erythromycin. Erythromycin is available in the United States for oral administration
as erythromycin base (tablets 
and  capsules),  erythromycin  stearate  (tablets),  and  erythromycin  ethylsuccinate
(tablets, powders, and liquids). 
Because relapses have been reported after completion of 7--10 days of treatment with
erythromycin, a 14-day course 
of  erythromycin  is  recommended  for  treatment  of  patients  with  pertussis  or  for
postexposure prophylaxis of close contacts 
of pertussis patients (76). 
 Recommended regimen:
 Gastrointestinal  irritation,  including  epigastric  distress,  abdominal  cramps,  nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea, are the 
most  common  adverse  effects  associated  with  oral  administration  of  erythromycin.
Symptoms are dose-related. Some 
formulations with enteric-coated tablets and the ester derivatives (e.g., ethylsuccinate)
can be taken with food to minimize these side 
effects.  Hypersensitivity  reactions  (e.g.,  skin  rashes,  drug  fever,  or  eosinophilia),
cholestatic hepatitis, and sensorineural hearing 
loss  have  occurred  after  administration  of  macrolides;  severe  reactions  such  as
anaphylaxis are rare.

 An  increased  risk  for  IHPS  has  been  reported  in  neonates  during  the  month  after
erythromycin administration. In one 
case,  pyloric  stenosis  occurred  in  a  breastfeeding  infant  whose  mother  took
erythromycin. In 1999, a cluster of seven cases of 
IHPS were reported among neonates (all aged <3 weeks when prophylaxis was started)
who had taken erythromycin after 
exposure  to  a  pertussis  patient.  In  a  cohort  study,  erythromycin  prophylaxis  was
causally associated with IHPS (seven cases out of 
157  erythromycin  exposed  infants  versus  zero  cases  out  of  125  infants  with  no
erythromycin exposure (relative risk: infinity 
[95% confidence interval = 1.7--infinity]). 
 The  high  case-fatality  ratio  of  pertussis  in  neonates  underscores  the  importance  of
preventing pertussis among 
exposed  infants.  Health-care  providers  who  prescribe  erythromycin  rather  than
azithromycin to newborns should inform parents 
about the possible risks for IHPS and counsel them about signs of IHPS.
 Erythromycin is contraindicated if there is history of hypersensitivity to any macrolide 
agent.  Erythromycin  should  not  be  administered  concomitantly  with  astemizole,
cisapride, pimazole, or terfenadine. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular 
adverse events, including electrocardiographic 
QT/QTc interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other 
ventricular  arrhythmias,  have  been  observed  after  concomitant  use  of  erythromycin
with these drugs.
 Erythromycin is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system (CYP3A subclass).
Coadministration of 
erythromycin and a drug that is primarily metabolized by CYP3A can result in elevations
in drug concentrations that could increase 

or  prolong  both  the  therapeutic  and  adverse  effects  of  the  concomitant  drug.  Drugs
that are metabolized by CYP3A 
include
 alfentanil,
 bromocriptine,
 cyclosporine,
 carbamazepine,
 cilostazol,
disopyramide, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, 
lovastatin  and  simvastatin,  methylprednisolone,  quinidine,  rifabutin,  vinblastine,
tacrolimus, triazolo-benzodiazepines (e.g., 
triazolam  and  alprazolam)  and  related  benzodiazepines,  and  sildenafil.   In  addition,
reports exists of drug interactions of 
erythromycin with drugs not thought to be metabolized by CYP3A, including zidovudine,
hexobarbital, phenytoin, and 
valproate, theophylline, digoxin, and oral anticoagulants. 
 Erythromycin is classified as an FDA Pregnancy Category B drug 
(76). Animal reproduction studies have failed 
to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, but no adequate or well-controlled studies in humans
exist.
 3.  Clarithromycin.  Clarithromycin  is  available  in  the  United  States  for  oral
administration as granules for oral 
suspension and tablets.  Recommended regimen:
 The  most  common  adverse  effects  associated  with  clarithromycin  include  epigastric
distress, abdominal cramps, 
nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhea.  Hypersensitivity  reactions  (e.g.,  skin  rashes,  drug
fever, or eosinophilia), hepatotoxicity, and 
severe reactions such as anaphylaxis are rare. Because of its similarity to erythromycin,
both chemically and 
metabolically,  clarithromycin  should  not  be  administered  to  infants  aged  <1  month
because it is unknown if the drug can be 
similarly  associated  with  IHPS.  The  drug  is  contraindicated  if  there  is  history  of

hypersensitivity to any macrolide agent. Similar 
to  erythromycin,  clarithromycin  should  not  be  administered  concomitantly  with
astemizole, cisapride, pimazole, or 
terfenadine.  Clarithromycin  inhibits  the  cytochrome  P450  enzyme  system  (CYP3A
subclass), and coadministration of clarithromycin 
and  a  drug  that  is  primarily  metabolized  by  CYP3A  can  result  in  elevations  in  drug
concentrations that could increase or 
prolong  both  the  therapeutic  and  adverse  effects  of  the  concomitant  drug.
Clarithromycin can be administered without 
dosage  adjustment  in  patients  with  impaired  hepatic  function  and  normal  renal
function; however, drug dosage and interval 
between  doses  should  be  reassessed  in  the  presence  of  impaired  renal  function.
Clarithromycin is classified by FDA as a 
Pregnancy Category C drug (76). Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse
effect on the fetus; no adequate or 
well-controlled studies in humans exist. 
 4.  Alternate  agent  (TMP--SMZ).  Data  from  clinical  studies  indicate  that  TMP--SMZ  is
effective in eradicating 
B. pertussis from the nasopharynx 
(64,77,78).  TMP--SMZ  is  used  as  an  alternative  to  a  macrolide  antibiotic  in  patients
aged 
>2 months who have contraindication to or cannot tolerate macrolide agents, or who
are infected with a macrolide-resistant strain of 
B. pertussis. Macrolide-resistant B. 
pertussis is rare. Because of the potential risk for kernicterus among infants, 
TMP--SMZ should not be administered to pregnant women, nursing mothers, or infants
aged <2 months.

 Recommended regimen (79):
 Patients  receiving  TMP-SMZ  might  experience  gastrointestinal  adverse  effects,
hypersensitivity skin reactions, and 
rarely,  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome,  toxic  epidermal  necrolysis,  blood  dyscrasias,  and
hepatic necrosis. TMP--SMZ is 
contraindicated  if  there  is  known  hypersensitivity  to  trimethoprim  or  sulfonamides.
TMP--SMZ should be prescribed with caution to 
patients with impaired hepatic and renal functions, folate deficiency, blood dyscrasias,
and in older adults because of the 
higher  incidence  of  severe  adverse  events.  Patients  taking  TMP--SMZ  should  be
instructed to maintain an adequate fluid intake 
to  prevent  crystalluria  and  renal  stones.  Drug  interactions  must  be  considered  when
TMP--SMZ is used concomitantly 
with  drugs,  including  methotrexate,  oral  anticoagulants,  antidiabetic  agents,  thiazide
diuretics, anticonvulsants, and 
other  antiretroviral  drugs.  TMP--SMZ  is  classified  by  FDA  as  a  Pregnancy  Category  C
drug 
(76).  Animal  reproduction  studies  have  indicated  an  adverse  effect  on  the  fetus;  no
adequate or well-controlled studies in humans exist. 
 5. Other antimicrobial agents. Although in vitro activity against 
B. pertussis has been demonstrated for other 
macrolides such as roxithromycin and ketolides (e.g., telithromycin) 
(60), no published data exist on the clinical effectiveness of 
these agents. 
 Other
 antimicrobial
 agents
 such
 as
 ampicillin,
 amoxicillin,
 tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones 
(e.g.,  ciprofloxacin,  levofloxacin,  ofloxacin,   moxifloxacin),  and  cephalosporins  exhibit

various levels of in 
vitro inhibitory activity against B. 
pertussis,  but  in  vitro  inhibitory  activity  does  not  predict  clinical  effectiveness.  The
clinical effectiveness of 
these agents for treatment of pertussis has not been demonstrated. For example, both
ampicillin and amoxicillin were ineffective 
in clearing B. pertussis from nasopharynx 
(80). Poor penetration into respiratory secretions was proposed as a possible 
mechanism for failure to clear B. pertussis 
from the nasopharynx (81). The minimum inhibitory concentration of 
B. pertussis to the cephalosporins is unacceptably high 
(82). In addition, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, and fluoroquinolones have 
potentially harmful side effects in children. Therefore, none of the above antimicrobial
agents are recommended for treatment 
or postexposure prophylaxis of pertussis.
