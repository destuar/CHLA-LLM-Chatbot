for  Disinfection  and  Sterilization  in  Healthcare  Facilities  (2008).  In  the  healthcare
setting,  "alcohol"  refers  to  two  water-soluble  chemical  compounds—ethyl  alcohol  and
isopropyl alcohol—that have generally underrated germicidal characteristics 482. FDA
has not cleared any liquid chemical sterilant or high-level disinfectant with alcohol as
the  main  active  ingredient.  These  alcohols  are  rapidly  bactericidal  rather  than
bacteriostatic  against  vegetative  forms  of  bacteria;  they  also  are  tuberculocidal,
fungicidal, and virucidal but do not destroy bacterial spores. Their cidal activity drops
sharply  when  diluted  below  50%  concentration,  and  the  optimum  bactericidal
concentration  is  60%–90%  solutions  in  water  (volume/volume)  483,  484.  The  most
feasible explanation for the antimicrobial action of alcohol is denaturation of proteins.
This  mechanism  is  supported  by  the  observation  that  absolute  ethyl  alcohol,  a
dehydrating  agent,  is  less  bactericidal  than  mixtures  of  alcohol  and  water  because
proteins  are  denatured  more  quickly  in  the  presence  of  water  484,  485.  Protein
denaturation  also  is  consistent  with  observations  that  alcohol  destroys  the
dehydrogenases of Escherichia coli 486, and that ethyl alcohol increases the lag phase
of  Enterobacter  aerogenes  487  and  that  the  lag  phase  effect  could  be  reversed  by
adding certain amino acids. The bacteriostatic action was believed caused by inhibition
of  the  production  of  metabolites  essential  for  rapid  cell  division.  Methyl  alcohol
(methanol) has the weakest bactericidal action of the alcohols and thus seldom is used
in  healthcare  488.  The  bactericidal  activity  of  various  concentrations  of  ethyl  alcohol
(ethanol)  was  examined  against  a  variety  of  microorganisms  in  exposure  periods
ranging  from  10  seconds  to  1  hour  483.  Pseudomonas  aeruginosa  was  killed  in  10
seconds  by  all  concentrations  of  ethanol  from  30%  to  100%  (v/v),  and  Serratia
marcescens,  E,  coli  and  Salmonella  typhosa  were  killed  in  10  seconds  by  all

concentrations  of  ethanol  from  40%  to  100%.  The  gram-positive  organisms
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were slightly more resistant, being
killed  in  10  seconds  by  ethyl  alcohol  concentrations  of  60%–95%.  Isopropyl  alcohol
(isopropanol) was slightly more bactericidal than ethyl alcohol for E. coli and S. aureus
489.  Ethyl  alcohol,  at  concentrations  of  60%–80%,  is  a  potent  virucidal  agent
inactivating all of the lipophilic viruses (e.g., herpes, vaccinia, and influenza virus) and
many hydrophilic viruses (e.g., adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and rotaviruses but
not hepatitis A virus (HAV) 58 or poliovirus) 49. Isopropyl alcohol is not active against
the nonlipid enteroviruses but is fully active against the lipid viruses 72. Studies also
have demonstrated the ability of ethyl and isopropyl alcohol to inactivate the hepatitis
B virus(HBV) 224, 225 and the herpes virus, 490 and ethyl alcohol to inactivate human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 227, rotavirus, echovirus, and astrovirus 491. In tests of
the effect of ethyl alcohol against M. tuberculosis, 95% ethanol killed the tubercle bacilli
in sputum or water suspension within 15 seconds 492. In 1964, Spaulding stated that
alcohols were the germicide of choice for tuberculocidal activity, and they should be the
standard by which all other tuberculocides are compared. For example, he compared
the  tuberculocidal  activity  of  iodophor  (450  ppm),  a  substituted  phenol  (3%),  and
isopropanol (70%/volume) using the mucin-loop test (106 M. tuberculosis per loop) and
determined the contact times needed for complete destruction were 120–180 minutes,
45–60  minutes,  and  5  minutes,  respectively.  The  mucin-loop  test  is  a  severe  test
developed  to  produce  long  survival  times.  Thus,  these  figures  should  not  be
extrapolated to the exposure times needed when these germicides are used on medical
or surgical material 482. Ethyl alcohol (70%) was the most effective concentration for
killing  the  tissue  phase  of  Cryptococcus  neoformans,  Blastomyces  dermatitidis,
Coccidioides immitis, and Histoplasma capsulatum and the culture phases of the latter
three  organisms  aerosolized  onto  various  surfaces.  The  culture  phase  was  more
resistant to the action of ethyl alcohol and required about 20 minutes to disinfect the

contaminated  surface,  compared  with  <1  minute  for  the  tissue  phase  493,  494.
Isopropyl  alcohol  (20%)  is  effective  in  killing  the  cysts  of  Acanthamoeba  culbertsoni
(560)  as  are  chlorhexidine,  hydrogen  peroxide,  and  thimerosal  496.  Alcohols  are  not
recommended  for  sterilizing  medical  and  surgical  materials  principally  because  they
lack  sporicidal  action  and  they  cannot  penetrate  protein-rich  materials.  Fatal
postoperative  wound  infections  with  Clostridium  have  occurred  when  alcohols  were
used to sterilize surgical instruments contaminated with bacterial spores 497. Alcohols
have been used effectively to disinfect oral and rectal thermometers498, 499, hospital
pagers 500, scissors 501, and stethoscopes 502. Alcohols have been used to disinfect
fiberoptic  endoscopes  503,  504  but  failure  of  this  disinfectant  have  lead  to  infection
280, 505. Alcohol towelettes have been used for years to disinfect small surfaces such
as  rubber  stoppers  of  multiple-dose  medication  vials  or  vaccine  bottles.  Furthermore,
alcohol  occasionally  is  used  to  disinfect  external  surfaces  of  equipment  (e.g.,
stethoscopes, ventilators, manual ventilation bags) 506, CPR manikins 507, ultrasound
instruments  508  or  medication  preparation  areas.  Two  studies  demonstrated  the
effectiveness  of  70%  isopropyl  alcohol  to  disinfect  reusable  transducer  heads  in  a
controlled  environment  509,  510.  In  contrast,  three  bloodstream  infection  outbreaks
have  been  described  when  alcohol  was  used  to  disinfect  transducer  heads  in  an
intensive-care setting 511. The documented shortcomings of alcohols on equipment are
that  they  damage  the  shellac  mountings  of  lensed  instruments,  tend  to  swell  and
harden  rubber  and  certain  plastic  tubing  after  prolonged  and  repeated  use,  bleach
rubber and plastic tiles 482 and damage tonometer tips (by deterioration of the glue)
after the equivalent of 1 working year of routine use 512. Tonometer biprisms soaked in
alcohol for 4 days developed rough front surfaces that potentially could cause corneal
damage; this appeared to be caused by weakening of the cementing substances used
to fabricate the biprisms 513. Corneal opacification has been reported when tonometer
tips  were  swabbed  with  alcohol  immediately  before  measurement  of  intraocular

pressure  514.  Alcohols  are  flammable  and  consequently  must  be  stored  in  a  cool,
well-ventilated  area.  They  also  evaporate  rapidly,  making  extended  exposure  time
difficult to achieve unless the items are immersed. Hypochlorites, the most widely used
of the chlorine disinfectants, are available as liquid (e.g., sodium hypochlorite) or solid
(e.g., calcium hypochlorite). The most prevalent chlorine products in the United States
are  aqueous  solutions  of  5.25%–6.15%  sodium  hypochlorite  (see  glossary),  usually
called household bleach. They have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, do not
leave toxic residues, are unaffected by water hardness, are inexpensive and fast acting
328, remove dried or fixed organisms and biofilms from surfaces465, and have a low
incidence of serious toxicity 515-517. Sodium hypochlorite at the concentration used in
household  bleach  (5.25-6.15%)  can  produce  ocular  irritation  or  oropharyngeal,
esophageal,  and  gastric  burns  318,  518-522.  Other  disadvantages  of  hypochlorites
include  corrosiveness  to  metals  in  high  concentrations  (>500  ppm),  inactivation  by
organic matter, discoloring or "bleaching" of fabrics, release of toxic chlorine gas when
mixed  with  ammonia  or  acid  (e.g.,  household  cleaning  agents)  523-525,  and  relative
stability 327. The microbicidal activity of chlorine is attributed largely to undissociated
hypochlorous  acid  (HOCl).  The  dissociation  of  HOCI  to  the  less  microbicidal  form
(hypochlorite ion OCl-) depends on pH. The disinfecting efficacy of chlorine decreases
with an increase in pH that parallels the conversion of undissociated HOCI to OCl- 329,
526. A potential hazard is production of the carcinogen bis(chloromethyl) ether when
hypochlorite  solutions  contact  formaldehyde  527  and  the  production  of  the  animal
carcinogen  trihalomethane  when  hot  water  is  hyperchlorinated  528.  After  reviewing
environmental fate and ecologic data, EPA has determined the currently registered uses
of hypochlorites will not result in unreasonable adverse effects to the environment 529.
Alternative  compounds  that  release  chlorine  and  are  used  in  the  health-care  setting
include
 demand-release
 chlorine
 dioxide,
 sodium
 dichloroisocyanurate,
 and
chloramine-T. The advantage of these compounds over the hypochlorites is that they

retain  chlorine  longer  and  so  exert  a  more  prolonged  bactericidal  effect.  Sodium
dichloroisocyanurate tablets are stable, and for two reasons, the microbicidal activity of
solutions prepared from sodium dichloroisocyanurate tablets might be greater than that
of sodium hypochlorite solutions containing the same total available chlorine. First, with
sodium dichloroisocyanurate, only 50% of the total available chlorine is free (HOCl and
OCl–),
 whereas
 the
 remainder
 is
 combined
 (monochloroisocyanurate
 or
dichloroisocyanurate), and as free available chlorine is used up, the latter is released to
restore  the  equilibrium.  Second,  solutions  of  sodium  dichloroisocyanurate  are  acidic,
whereas sodium hypochlorite solutions are alkaline, and the more microbicidal type of
chlorine  (HOCl)  is  believed
 to
 predominate  530-533.  Chlorine  dioxide-based
disinfectants  are  prepared  fresh  as  required  by  mixing  the  two  components  (base
solution  [citric  acid  with  preservatives  and  corrosion  inhibitors]  and  the  activator
solution [sodium chlorite]). In vitro suspension tests showed that solutions containing
about 140 ppm chlorine dioxide achieved a reduction factor exceeding 106 of S. aureus
in 1 minute and of Bacillus atrophaeus spores in 2.5 minutes in the presence of 3 g/L
bovine albumin. The potential for damaging equipment requires consideration because
long-term use can damage the outer plastic coat of the insertion tube 534. In another
study,  chlorine  dioxide  solutions  at  either  600  ppm  or  30  ppm  killed  Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare  within  60  seconds  after  contact  but  contamination  by  organic
material significantly affected the microbicidal properties535. The microbicidal activity
of  a  new  disinfectant,  "superoxidized  water,"  has  been  examined  The  concept  of
electrolyzing  saline  to  create  a  disinfectant  or  antiseptics  is  appealing  because  the
basic  materials  of  saline  and  electricity  are  inexpensive  and  the  end  product  (i.e.,
water)  does  not  damage  the  environment.  The  main  products  of  this  water  are
hypochlorous  acid  (e.g.,  at  a  concentration  of  about  144  mg/L)  and  chlorine.  As  with
any germicide, the antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water is strongly affected by
the  concentration  of  the  active  ingredient  (available  free  chlorine)  536.  One

manufacturer generates the disinfectant at the point of use by passing a saline solution
over coated titanium electrodes at 9 amps. The product generated has a pH of 5.0–6.5
and an oxidation-reduction potential (redox) of >950 mV. Although superoxidized water
is  intended  to  be  generated  fresh  at  the  point  of  use,  when  tested  under  clean
conditions  the  disinfectant  was  effective  within  5  minutes  when  48  hours  old  537.
Unfortunately,  the  equipment  required  to  produce  the  product  can  be  expensive
because  parameters  such  as  pH,  current,  and  redox  potential  must  be  closely
monitored.  The  solution  is  nontoxic  to  biologic  tissues.  Although  the  United  Kingdom
manufacturer claims the solution is noncorrosive and nondamaging to endoscopes and
processing equipment, one flexible endoscope manufacturer (Olympus Key-Med, United
Kingdom) has voided the warranty on the endoscopes if superoxidized water is used to
disinfect them 538. As with any germicide formulation, the user should check with the
device manufacturer for compatibility with the germicide. Additional studies are needed
to  determine  whether  this  solution  could  be  used  as  an  alternative  to  other
disinfectants  or  antiseptics  for  hand  washing,  skin  antisepsis,  room  cleaning,  or
equipment  disinfection  (e.g.,  endoscopes,  dialyzers)  400,  539,  540.  In  October  2002,
the  FDA  cleared  superoxidized  water  as  a  high-level  disinfectant  (FDA,  personal
communication,  September  18,  2002).  The  exact  mechanism  by  which  free  chlorine
destroys  microorganisms  has  not  been  elucidated.  Inactivation  by  chlorine  can  result
from  a  number  of  factors:  oxidation  of  sulfhydryl  enzymes  and  amino  acids;  ring
chlorination  of  amino  acids;  loss  of  intracellular  contents;  decreased  uptake  of
nutrients;  inhibition  of  protein  synthesis;  decreased  oxygen  uptake;  oxidation  of
respiratory components; decreased adenosine triphosphate production; breaks in DNA;
and depressed DNA synthesis 329, 347. The actual microbicidal mechanism of chlorine
might involve a combination of these factors or the effect of chlorine on critical sites
347.  Low  concentrations  of  free  available  chlorine  (e.g.,  HOCl,  OCl–,  and  elemental
chlorine-Cl2) have a biocidal effect on mycoplasma (25 ppm) and vegetative bacteria

(<5 ppm) in seconds in the absence of an organic load 329, 418. Higher concentrations
(1,000  ppm)  of  chlorine  are  required  to  kill  M.  tuberculosis  using  the  Association  of
Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) tuberculocidal test 73. A concentration of 100 ppm
will kill ≥99.9% of B. atrophaeus spores within 5 minutes 541, 542 and destroy mycotic
agents in <1 hour 329. Acidified bleach and regular bleach (5,000 ppm chlorine) can
inactivate 106 Clostridium difficile spores in ≤10 minutes 262. One study reported that
25 different viruses were inactivated in 10 minutes with 200 ppm available chlorine 72.
Several  studies  have  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  diluted  sodium  hypochlorite
and  other  disinfectants  to  inactivate  HIV  61.  Chlorine  (500  ppm)  showed  inhibition  of
Candida after 30 seconds of exposure 54. In experiments using the AOAC Use-Dilution
Method,  100  ppm  of  free  chlorine  killed  106–107  S.  aureus,  Salmonella  choleraesuis,
and  P.  aeruginosa  in  <10  minutes  327.  Because  household  bleach  contains
5.25%–6.15% sodium hypochlorite, or 52,500–61,500 ppm available chlorine, a 1:1,000
dilution provides about 53–62 ppm available chlorine, and a 1:10 dilution of household
bleach  provides  about  5250–6150  ppm.  Data  are  available  for  chlorine  dioxide  that
support manufacturers' bactericidal, fungicidal, sporicidal, tuberculocidal, and virucidal
label  claims  543-546.  A  chlorine  dioxide  generator  has  been  shown  effective  for
decontaminating flexible endoscopes 534 but it is not currently FDA-cleared for use as a
high-level disinfectant 85. Chlorine dioxide can be produced by mixing solutions, such
as  a  solution  of  chlorine  with  a  solution  of  sodium  chlorite  329.  In  1986,  a  chlorine
dioxide product was voluntarily removed from the market when its use caused leakage
of  cellulose-based  dialyzer  membranes,  which  allowed  bacteria  to  migrate  from  the
dialysis fluid side of the dialyzer to the blood side 547.  Sodium dichloroisocyanurate at
2,500 ppm available chlorine is effective against bacteria in the presence of up to 20%
plasma,  compared  with  10%  plasma  for  sodium  hypochlorite  at  2,500  ppm  548.
"Superoxidized water" has been tested against bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, fungi,
and  spores  537,  539,  549.  Freshly  generated  superoxidized  water  is  rapidly  effective

(<2  minutes)  in  achieving  a  5-log10  reduction  of  pathogenic  microorganisms  (i.e.,  M.
tuberculosis, M. chelonae, poliovirus, HIV, multidrug-resistant S. aureus, E. coli, Candida
albicans,  Enterococcus  faecalis,  P.  aeruginosa)  in  the  absence  of  organic  loading.
However,  the  biocidal  activity  of  this  disinfectant  decreased  substantially  in  the
presence  of  organic  material  (e.g.,  5%  horse  serum)  537,  549,  550.  No  bacteria  or
viruses  were  detected  on  artificially  contaminated  endoscopes  after  a  5-minute
exposure  to  superoxidized  water  551  and  HBV-DNA  was  not  detected  from  any
endoscope  experimentally  contaminated  with  HBV-positive  mixed  sera  after  a
disinfectant  exposure  time  of  7  minutes552.  Hypochlorites  are  widely  used  in
healthcare facilities in a variety of settings. 328 Inorganic chlorine solution is used for
disinfecting tonometer heads 188 and for spot-disinfection of countertops and floors. A
1:10–1:100  dilution  of  5.25%–6.15%  sodium  hypochlorite  (i.e.,  household  bleach)  22,
228,  553,  554  or  an  EPA-registered  tuberculocidal  disinfectant  17has  been
recommended for decontaminating blood spills. For small spills of blood (i.e., drops of
blood)  on  noncritical  surfaces,  the  area  can  be  disinfected  with  a  1:100  dilution  of
5.25%-6.15%  sodium  hypochlorite  or  an  EPA-registered  tuberculocidal  disinfectant.
Because  hypochlorites  and  other  germicides  are  substantially  inactivated  in  the
presence of blood 63, 548, 555, 556, large spills of blood require that the surface be
cleaned before an EPA-registered disinfectant or a 1:10 (final concentration) solution of
household  bleach  is  applied  557.  If  a  sharps  injury  is  possible,  the  surface  initially
should  be  decontaminated  69,  318,  then  cleaned  and  disinfected  (1:10  final
concentration)  63.  Extreme  care  always  should  be  taken  to  prevent  percutaneous
injury.  At  least  500  ppm  available  chlorine  for  10  minutes  is  recommended  for
decontaminating
 CPR
 training
 manikins
 558.
 Full-strength
 bleach
 has
 been
recommended for self-disinfection of needles and syringes used for illicit-drug injection
when needle-exchange programs are not available. The difference in the recommended
concentrations  of  bleach  reflects  the  difficulty  of  cleaning  the  interior  of  needles  and

syringes  and  the  use  of  needles  and  syringes  for  parenteral  injection  559.  Clinicians
should not alter their use of chlorine on environmental surfaces on the basis of testing
methodologies that do not simulate actual disinfection practices 560, 561. Other uses in
healthcare  include  as  an  irrigating  agent  in  endodontic  treatment  562  and  as  a
disinfectant  for  manikins,  laundry,  dental  appliances,  hydrotherapy  tanks  23,  41,
regulated  medical  waste  before  disposal  328,  and  the  water  distribution  system  in
hemodialysis centers and hemodialysis machines 563. Chlorine long has been used as
the  disinfectant  in  water  treatment.  Hyperchlorination  of  a  Legionella-contaminated
hospital  water  system  23  resulted  in  a  dramatic  decrease  (from  30%  to  1.5%)  in  the
isolation of L. pneumophila from water outlets and a cessation of healthcare-associated
Legionnaires'  disease  in  an  affected  unit  528,  564.  Water  disinfection  with
monochloramine by municipal water-treatment plants substantially reduced the risk for
healthcare–associated  Legionnaires  disease  565,  566.  Chlorine  dioxide  also  has  been
used  to  control  Legionella  in  a  hospital  water  supply.  567  Chloramine  T  568  and
hypochlorites  41  have  been  used  to  disinfect  hydrotherapy  equipment.   Hypochlorite
solutions in tap water at a pH >8 stored at room temperature (23°C) in closed, opaque
plastic containers can lose up to 40%–50% of their free available chlorine level over 1
month.  Thus,  if  a  user  wished  to  have  a  solution  containing  500  ppm  of  available
chlorine  at  day  30,  he  or  she  should  prepare  a  solution  containing  1,000  ppm  of
chlorine  at  time  0.  Sodium  hypochlorite  solution  does  not  decompose  after  30  days
when stored in a closed brown bottle 327. The use of powders, composed of a mixture
of a chlorine-releasing agent with highly absorbent resin, for disinfecting spills of body
fluids has been evaluated by laboratory tests and hospital ward trials. The inclusion of
acrylic resin particles in formulations markedly increases the volume of fluid that can be
soaked  up  because  the  resin  can  absorb  200–300  times  its  own  weight  of  fluid,
depending  on  the  fluid  consistency.  When  experimental  formulations  containing  1%,
5%, and 10% available chlorine were evaluated by a standardized surface test, those

containing 10% demonstrated bactericidal activity. One problem with chlorine-releasing
granules  is  that  they  can  generate  chlorine  fumes  when  applied  to  urine  569.
Formaldehyde  is  used  as  a  disinfectant  and  sterilant  in  both  its  liquid  and  gaseous
states. Liquid formaldehyde will be considered briefly in this section, and the gaseous
form  is  reviewed  elsewhere  570.  Formaldehyde  is  sold  and  used  principally  as  a
water-based  solution  called  formalin,  which  is  37%  formaldehyde  by  weight.  The
aqueous  solution  is  a  bactericide,  tuberculocide,  fungicide,  virucide  and  sporicide  72,
82, 571-573. OSHA indicated that formaldehyde should be handled in the workplace as
a potential carcinogen and set an employee exposure standard for formaldehyde that
limits an 8-hour time-weighted average exposure concentration of 0.75 ppm 574, 575.
The standard includes a second permissible exposure limit in the form of a short-term
exposure  limit  (STEL)  of  2  ppm  that  is  the  maximum  exposure  allowed  during  a
15-minute period 576. Ingestion of formaldehyde can be fatal, and long-term exposure
to low levels in the air or on the skin can cause asthma-like respiratory problems and
skin  irritation,  such  as  dermatitis  and  itching.  For  these  reasons,  employees  should
have limited direct contact with formaldehyde, and these considerations limit its role in
sterilization  and  disinfection  processes.  Key  provisions  of  the  OSHA  standard  that
protects  workers  from  exposure  to  formaldehyde  appear  in  Title  29  of  the  Code  of
Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Part  1910.1048  (and  equivalent  regulations  in  states  with
OSHA-approved  state  plans)  577.  Formaldehyde  inactivates  microorganisms  by
alkylating  the  amino  and  sulfhydral  groups  of  proteins  and  ring  nitrogen  atoms  of
purine bases 376. Varying concentrations of aqueous formaldehyde solutions destroy a
wide range of microorganisms. Inactivation of poliovirus in 10 minutes required an 8%
concentration of formalin, but all other viruses tested were inactivated with 2% formalin
72.  Four  percent  formaldehyde  is  a  tuberculocidal  agent,  inactivating  104  M.
tuberculosis in 2 minutes 82, and 2.5% formaldehyde inactivated about 107 Salmonella
Typhi  in  10  minutes  in  the  presence  of  organic  matter  572.  The  sporicidal  action  of

formaldehyde  was  slower  than  that  of  glutaraldehyde  in  comparative  tests  with  4%
aqueous  formaldehyde  and  2%  glutaraldehyde  against  the  spores  of  B.  anthracis  82.
The formaldehyde solution required 2 hours of contact to achieve an inactivation factor
of
 104,
 whereas
 glutaraldehyde
 required
 only
 15
 minutes.
 Although
formaldehyde-alcohol  is  a  chemical  sterilant  and  formaldehyde  is  a  high-level
disinfectant,  the  health-care  uses  of  formaldehyde  are  limited  by  its  irritating  fumes
and  its  pungent  odor  even  at  very  low  levels  (<1  ppm).  For  these  reasons  and
others—such as its role as a suspected human carcinogen linked to nasal cancer and
lung  cancer  578,  this  germicide  is  excluded  from  Table  1.  When  it  is  used,  ,  direct
exposure  to  employees  generally  is  limited;  however,  excessive  exposures  to
formaldehyde have been documented for employees of renal transplant units 574, 579,
and  students  in  a  gross  anatomy  laboratory  580.  Formaldehyde  is  used  in  the
health-care  setting  to  prepare  viral  vaccines  (e.g.,  poliovirus  and  influenza);  as  an
embalming agent; and to preserve anatomic specimens; and historically has been used
to  sterilize  surgical  instruments,  especially  when  mixed  with  ethanol.  A  1997  survey
found  that  formaldehyde  was  used  for  reprocessing  hemodialyzers  by  34%  of  U.S.
hemodialysis  centers—a  60%  decrease  from  1983  249,  581.  If  used  at  room
temperature, a concentration of 4% with a minimum exposure of 24 hours is required to
disinfect  disposable  hemodialyzers  reused  on  the  same  patient  582,  583.  Aqueous
formaldehyde  solutions  (1%–2%)  also  have  been  used  to  disinfect  the  internal  fluid
pathways  of  dialysis  machines  583.  To  minimize  a  potential  health  hazard  to  dialysis
patients,  the  dialysis  equipment  must  be  thoroughly  rinsed  and  tested  for  residual
formaldehyde before use. Paraformaldehyde, a solid polymer of formaldehyde, can be
vaporized  by  heat  for  the  gaseous  decontamination  of  laminar  flow  biologic  safety
cabinets when maintenance work or filter changes require access to the sealed portion
of  the  cabinet.  Glutaraldehyde  is  a  saturated  dialdehyde  that  has  gained  wide
acceptance as a high-level disinfectant and chemical sterilant 107. Aqueous solutions of

glutaraldehyde are acidic and generally in this state are not sporicidal. Only when the
solution is "activated" (made alkaline) by use of alkalinating agents to pH 7.5–8.5 does
the  solution  become  sporicidal.  Once  activated,  these  solutions  have  a  shelf-life  of
minimally  14  days  because  of  the  polymerization  of  the  glutaraldehyde  molecules  at
alkaline pH levels. This polymerization blocks the active sites (aldehyde groups) of the
glutaraldehyde  molecules  that  are  responsible  for  its  biocidal  activity.  Novel
glutaraldehyde formulations (e.g., glutaraldehyde-phenol-sodium phenate, potentiated
acid glutaraldehyde, stabilized alkaline glutaraldehyde) produced in the past 30 years
have  overcome  the  problem  of  rapid  loss  of  activity  (e.g.,  use-life  28–30  days)  while
generally  maintaining  excellent  microbicidal  activity  584-588.  However,  antimicrobial
activity  depends  not  only  on  age  but  also  on  use  conditions,  such  as  dilution  and
organic stress. Manufacturers' literature for these preparations suggests the neutral or
alkaline glutaraldehydes possess microbicidal and anticorrosion properties superior to
those  of  acid  glutaraldehydes,  and  a  few  published  reports  substantiate  these  claims
542, 589, 590. However, two studies found no difference in the microbicidal activity of
alkaline and acid glutaraldehydes 73, 591. The use of glutaraldehyde-based solutions in
health-care  facilities  is  widespread  because  of  their  advantages,  including  excellent
biocidal properties; activity in the presence of organic matter (20% bovine serum); and
noncorrosive  action  to  endoscopic  equipment,  thermometers,  rubber,  or  plastic
equipment  (Tables  4  and  5).  The  biocidal  activity  of  glutaraldehyde  results  from  its
alkylation of sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino groups of microorganisms, which
alters  RNA,  DNA,  and  protein  synthesis.  The  mechanism  of  action  of  glutaraldehydes
are  reviewed  extensively  elsewhere  592,  593.  The  in  vitro  inactivation  of
microorganisms  by  glutaraldehydes  has  been  extensively  investigated  and  reviewed
592, 593. Several investigators showed that ≥2% aqueous solutions of glutaraldehyde,
buffered to pH 7.5–8.5 with sodium bicarbonate effectively killed vegetative bacteria in
<2 minutes; M. tuberculosis, fungi, and viruses in <10 minutes; and spores of Bacillus

and Clostridium species in 3 hours 542, 592-597. Spores of C. difficile are more rapidly
killed by 2% glutaraldehyde than are spores of other species of Clostridium and Bacillus
79, 265, 266. Microorganisms with substantial resistance to glutaraldehyde have been
reported,
 including
 some
 mycobacteria
 (M.
 chelonae,
 Mycobacterium
avium-intracellulare,  M.  xenopi)  598-601,  Methylobacterium  mesophilicum  602,
Trichosporon,  fungal  ascospores  (e.g.,  Microascus  cinereus,  Cheatomium  globosum),
and Cryptosporidium271, 603. M. chelonae persisted in a 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution
used to store porcine prosthetic heart valves 604. Two percent alkaline glutaraldehyde
solution inactivated 105 M. tuberculosis cells on the surface of penicylinders within 5
minutes at 18°C 589. However, subsequent studies82 questioned the mycobactericidal
prowess of glutaraldehydes. Two percent alkaline glutaraldehyde has slow action (20 to
>30  minutes)  against  M.  tuberculosis  and  compares  unfavorably  with  alcohols,
formaldehydes, iodine, and phenol 82. Suspensions of M. avium, M. intracellulare, and
M.  gordonae  were  more  resistant  to  inactivation  by  a  2%  alkaline  glutaraldehyde
(estimated  time  to  complete  inactivation:  ~60  minutes)  than  were  virulent  M.
tuberculosis (estimated time to complete inactivation ~25 minutes) 605. The rate of kill
was  directly  proportional  to  the  temperature,  and  a  standardized  suspension  of  M.
tuberculosis  could  not  be  sterilized  within  10  minutes  84.  An  FDA-cleared  chemical
sterilant containing 2.5% glutaraldehyde uses increased temperature (35°C) to reduce
the time required to achieve high-level disinfection (5 minutes) 85, 606, but its use is
limited to automatic endoscope reprocessors equipped with a heater. In another study
employing  membrane  filters  for  measurement  of  mycobactericidal  activity  of  2%
alkaline glutaraldehyde, complete inactivation was achieved within 20 minutes at 20°C
when  the  test  inoculum  was  106  M.  tuberculosis  per  membrane  81.  Several
investigators  55,  57,  73,  76,  80,  81,  84,  605  have  demonstrated  that  glutaraldehyde
solutions  inactivate  2.4  to  >5.0  log10  of  M.  tuberculosis  in  10  minutes  (including
multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis) and 4.0–6.4 log10 of M. tuberculosis in 20 minutes.

On  the  basis  of  these  data  and  other  studies,  20  minutes  at  room  temperature  is
considered the minimum exposure time needed to reliably kill Mycobacteria and other
vegetative bacteria with ≥2% glutaraldehyde 17, 19, 27, 57, 83, 94, 108, 111, 117-121,
607.  Glutaraldehyde  is  commonly  diluted  during  use,  and  studies  showed  a
glutaraldehyde  concentration  decline  after  a  few  days  of  use  in  an  automatic
endoscope  washer  608,  609.  The  decline  occurs  because  instruments  are  not
thoroughly  dried  and  water  is  carried  in  with  the  instrument,  which  increases  the
solution's volume and dilutes its effective concentration 610. This emphasizes the need
to ensure that semicritical equipment is disinfected with an acceptable concentration of
glutaraldehyde. Data suggest that 1.0%–1.5% glutaraldehyde is the minimum effective
concentration for >2% glutaraldehyde solutions when used as a high-level disinfectant
76,  589,  590,  609.  Chemical  test  strips  or  liquid  chemical  monitors  610,  611  are
available  for  determining  whether  an  effective  concentration  of  glutaraldehyde  is
present despite repeated use and dilution. The frequency of testing should be based on
how  frequently  the  solutions  are  used  (e.g.,  used  daily,  test  daily;  used  weekly,  test
before use; used 30 times per day, test each 10th use), but the strips should not be
used to extend the use life beyond the expiration date. Data suggest the chemicals in
the test strip deteriorate with time 612 and a manufacturer's expiration date should be
placed on the bottles. The bottle of test strips should be dated when opened and used
for the period of time indicated on the bottle (e.g., 120 days). The results of test strip
monitoring should be documented. The glutaraldehyde test kits have been preliminarily
evaluated for accuracy and range 612 but the reliability has been questioned 613. To
ensure the presence of minimum effective concentration of the high-level disinfectant,
manufacturers  of  some  chemical  test  strips  recommend  the  use  of  quality-control
procedures to ensure the strips perform properly. If the manufacturer of the chemical
test  strip  recommends  a  quality-control  procedure,  users  should  comply  with  the
manufacturer's
 recommendations.
 The
 concentration
 should
 be
 considered

unacceptable or unsafe when the test indicates a dilution below the product's minimum
effective  concentration  (MEC)  (generally  to  ≤1.0%–1.5%  glutaraldehyde)  by  the
indicator  not  changing  color.  A  2.0%  glutaraldehyde–7.05%  phenol–1.20%  sodium
phenate product that contained 0.125% glutaraldehyde–0.44% phenol–0.075% sodium
phenate when diluted 1:16 is not recommended as a high-level disinfectant because it
lacks  bactericidal  activity  in  the  presence  of  organic  matter  and  lacks  tuberculocidal,
fungicidal,  virucidal,  and  sporicidal  activity  49,  55,  56,  71,  73-79,  614.  In  December
1991,  EPA  issued  an  order  to  stop  the  sale  of  all  batches  of  this  product  because  of
efficacy  data  showing  the  product  is  not  effective  against  spores  and  possibly  other
microorganisms or inanimate objects as claimed on the label 615. FDA has cleared a
glutaraldehyde–phenol/phenate  concentrate  as  a  high-level  disinfectant  that  contains
1.12% glutaraldehyde with 1.93% phenol/phenate at its use concentration. Other FDA
cleared  glutaraldehyde  sterilants  that  contain  2.4%–3.4%  glutaraldehyde  are  used
undiluted 606. Glutaraldehyde is used most commonly as a high-level disinfectant for
medical equipment such as endoscopes 69, 107, 504, spirometry tubing, dialyzers 616,
transducers,  anesthesia  and  respiratory  therapy  equipment  617,  hemodialysis
proportioning  and  dialysate  delivery  systems  249,  618,  and  reuse  of  laparoscopic
disposable  plastic  trocars  619.  Glutaraldehyde  is  noncorrosive  to  metal  and  does  not
damage lensed instruments, rubber. or plastics. Glutaraldehyde should not be used for
cleaning  noncritical  surfaces  because  it  is  too  toxic  and  expensive.  Colitis  believed
caused  by  glutaraldehyde  exposure  from  residual  disinfecting  solution  in  endoscope
solution  channels  has  been  reported  and  is  preventable  by  careful  endoscope  rinsing
318,  620-630.  One  study  found  that  residual  glutaraldehyde  levels  were  higher  and
more variable after manual disinfection (<0.2 mg/L to 159.5 mg/L) than after automatic
disinfection  (0.2–6.3  mg/L)631.  Similarly,  keratopathy  and  corneal  decompensation
were caused by ophthalmic instruments that were inadequately rinsed after soaking in
2% glutaraldehyde 632, 633.  Healthcare personnel can be exposed to elevated levels

of glutaraldehyde vapor when equipment is processed in poorly ventilated rooms, when
spills occur, when glutaraldehyde solutions are activated or changed,634, or when open
immersion  baths  are  used.  Acute  or  chronic  exposure  can  result  in  skin  irritation  or
dermatitis,  mucous  membrane  irritation  (eye,  nose,  mouth),  or  pulmonary  symptoms
318, 635-639. Epistaxis, allergic contact dermatitis, asthma, and rhinitis also have been
reported
 in
 healthcare
 workers
 exposed
 to
 glutaraldehyde
 636,
 640-647.
Glutaraldehyde  exposure  should  be  monitored  to  ensure  a  safe  work  environment.
Testing can be done by four techniques: a silica gel tube/gas chromatography with a
flame
 ionization
 detector,
 dinitrophenylhydrazine
 (DNPH)-impregnated
 filter
cassette/high-performance  liquid  chromatography  (HPLC)  with  an  ultraviolet  (UV)
detector,  a  passive  badge/HPLC,  or  a  handheld  glutaraldehyde  air  monitor  648.  The
silica gel tube and the DNPH-impregnated cassette are suitable for monitoring the 0.05
ppm ceiling limit. The passive badge, with a 0.02 ppm limit of detection, is considered
marginal at the Americal Council of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) ceiling
level. The ceiling level is considered too close to the glutaraldehyde meter's 0.03 ppm
limit of detection to provide confidence in the readings 648. ACGIH does not require a
specific  monitoring  schedule  for  glutaraldehyde;  however,  a  monitoring  schedule  is
needed to ensure the level is less than the ceiling limit. For example, monitoring should
be  done  initially  to  determine  glutaraldehyde  levels,  after  procedural  or  equipment
changes,  and  in  response  to  worker  complaints  649.  In  the  absence  of  an  OSHA
permissible exposure limit, if the glutaraldehyde level is higher than the ACGIH ceiling
limit  of  0.05  ppm,  corrective  action  and  repeat  monitoring  would  be  prudent  649.
Engineering  and  work-practice  controls  that  can  be  used  to  resolve  these  problems
include ducted exhaust hoods, air systems that provide 7–15 air exchanges per hour,
ductless fume hoods with absorbents for the glutaraldehyde vapor, tight-fitting lids on
immersion baths, personal protection (e.g., nitrile or butyl rubber gloves but not natural
latex gloves, goggles) to minimize skin or mucous membrane contact, and automated

endoscope processors 7, 650. If engineering controls fail to maintain levels below the
ceiling limit, institutions can consider the use of respirators (e.g., a half-face respirator
with  organic  vapor  cartridge  640  or  a  type  "C"  supplied  air  respirator  with  a  full
facepiece operated in a positive pressure mode) 651. In general, engineering controls
are  preferred  over  work-practice  and  administrative  controls  because  they  do  not
require active participation by the health-care worker. Even though enforcement of the
OSHA  ceiling  limit  was  suspended  in  1993  by  the  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  577,  limiting
employee exposure to 0.05 ppm (according to ACGIH) is prudent because, at this level,
glutaraldehyde  can  irritate  the  eyes,  throat,  and  nose  318,  577,  639,  652.  If
glutaraldehyde  disposal  through  the  sanitary  sewer  system  is  restricted,  sodium
bisulfate  can  be  used  to  neutralize  the  glutaraldehyde  and  make  it  safe  for  disposal.
The literature contains several accounts of the properties, germicidal effectiveness, and
potential  uses  for  stabilized  hydrogen  peroxide  in  the  health-care  setting.  Published
reports  ascribe  good  germicidal  activity  to  hydrogen  peroxide  and  attest  to  its
bactericidal,  virucidal,  sporicidal,  and  fungicidal  properties  653-655.  (Tables  4  and  5)
The  FDA  website  lists  cleared  liquid  chemical  sterilants  and  high-level  disinfectants
containing hydrogen peroxide and their cleared contact conditions. Hydrogen peroxide
works by producing destructive hydroxyl free radicals that can attack membrane lipids,
DNA,  and  other  essential  cell  components.  Catalase,  produced  by  aerobic  organisms
and  facultative  anaerobes  that  possess  cytochrome  systems,  can  protect  cells  from
metabolically  produced  hydrogen  peroxide  by  degrading  hydrogen  peroxide  to  water
and oxygen. This defense is overwhelmed by the concentrations used for disinfection
653,  654.  Hydrogen  peroxide  is  active  against  a  wide  range  of  microorganisms,
including  bacteria,  yeasts,  fungi,  viruses,  and  spores  78,  654.  A  0.5%  accelerated
hydrogen  peroxide  demonstrated  bactericidal  and  virucidal  activity  in  1  minute  and
mycobactericidal  and  fungicidal  activity  in  5  minutes  656.  Bactericidal  effectiveness
and stability of hydrogen peroxide in urine has been demonstrated against a variety of

health-care–associated pathogens; organisms with high cellular catalase activity (e.g.,
S. aureus, S. marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis) required 30–60 minutes of exposure to
0.6%  hydrogen  peroxide  for  a  108  reduction  in  cell  counts,  whereas  organisms  with
lower catalase activity (e.g., E. coli, Streptococcus species, and Pseudomonas species)
required  only  15  minutes'  exposure  657.  In  an  investigation  of  3%,  10%,  and  15%
hydrogen peroxide for reducing spacecraft bacterial populations, a complete kill of 106
spores  (i.e.,  Bacillus  species)  occurred  with  a  10%  concentration  and  a  60-minute
exposure time. A 3% concentration for 150 minutes killed 106 spores in six of seven
exposure trials 658. A 10% hydrogen peroxide solution resulted in a 103 decrease in B.
atrophaeus spores, and a ≥105 decrease when tested against 13 other pathogens in 30
minutes at 20°C 659, 660. A 3.0% hydrogen peroxide solution was ineffective against
VRE after 3 and 10 minutes exposure times 661 and caused only a 2-log10 reduction in
the  number  of  Acanthamoeba  cysts  in  approximately  2  hours  662.  A  7%  stabilized
hydrogen peroxide proved to be sporicidal (6 hours of exposure), mycobactericidal (20
minutes), fungicidal (5 minutes) at full strength, virucidal (5 minutes) and bactericidal
(3 minutes) at a 1:16 dilution when a quantitative carrier test was used 655. The 7%
solution  of  hydrogen  peroxide,  tested  after  14  days  of  stress  (in  the  form  of
germ-loaded  carriers  and  respiratory  therapy  equipment),  was  sporicidal  (>7  log10
reduction in 6 hours), mycobactericidal (>6.5 log10 reduction in 25 minutes), fungicidal
(>5 log10 reduction in 20 minutes), bactericidal (>6 log10 reduction in 5 minutes) and
virucidal  (5  log10  reduction  in  5  minutes)  663.  Synergistic  sporicidal  effects  were
observed  when  spores  were  exposed  to  a  combination  of  hydrogen  peroxide
(5.9%–23.6%) and peracetic acid 664. Other studies demonstrated the antiviral activity
of hydrogen peroxide against rhinovirus 665. The time required for inactivating three
serotypes of rhinovirus using a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution was 6–8 minutes; this
time increased with decreasing concentrations (18-20 minutes at 1.5%, 50–60 minutes
at  0.75%).  Concentrations  of  hydrogen  peroxide  from  6%  to  25%  show  promise  as

chemical  sterilants.  The  product  marketed  as  a  sterilant  is  a  premixed,  ready-to-use
chemical  that  contains  7.5%  hydrogen  peroxide  and  0.85%  phosphoric  acid  (to
maintain  a  low  pH)  69.  The  mycobactericidal  activity  of  7.5%  hydrogen  peroxide  has
been corroborated in a study showing the inactivation of >105 multidrug-resistant M.
tuberculosis after a 10-minute exposure 666. Thirty minutes were required for >99.9%
inactivation of poliovirus and HAV 667. Three percent and 6% hydrogen peroxide were
unable  to  inactivate  HAV  in  1  minute  in  a  carrier  test  58.  When  the  effectiveness  of
7.5% hydrogen peroxide at 10 minutes was compared with 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde
at  20  minutes  in  manual  disinfection  of  endoscopes,  no  significant  difference  in
germicidal activity was observed 668. ). No complaints were received from the nursing
or medical staff regarding odor or toxicity. In one study, 6% hydrogen peroxide (unused
product  was  7.5%)  was  more  effective  in  the  high-level  disinfection  of  flexible
endoscopes than was the 2% glutaraldehyde solution 456. A new, rapid-acting 13.4%
hydrogen  peroxide  formulation  (that  is  not  yet  FDA-cleared)  has  demonstrated
sporicidal,  mycobactericidal,  fungicidal,  and  virucidal  efficacy.  Manufacturer  data
demonstrate  that  this  solution  sterilizes  in  30  minutes  and  provides  high-level
disinfection in 5 minutes669. This product has not been used long enough to evaluate
material  compatibility  to  endoscopes  and  other  semicritical  devices,  and  further
assessment  by  instrument  manufacturers  is  needed.  Under  normal  conditions,
hydrogen peroxide is extremely stable when properly stored (e.g., in dark containers).
The decomposition or loss of potency in small containers is less than 2% per year at
ambient temperatures 670. Commercially available 3% hydrogen peroxide is a stable
and  effective  disinfectant  when  used  on  inanimate  surfaces.  It  has  been  used  in
concentrations from 3% to 6% for disinfecting soft contact lenses (e.g., 3% for 2–3 hrs)
653, 671, 672, tonometer biprisms 513, ventilators 673, fabrics 397, and endoscopes
456.  Hydrogen  peroxide  was  effective  in  spot-disinfecting  fabrics  in  patients'  rooms
397.  Corneal  damage  from  a  hydrogen  peroxide-soaked  tonometer  tip  that  was  not

properly rinsed has been reported 674. Hydrogen peroxide also has been instilled into
urinary  drainage  bags  in  an  attempt  to  eliminate  the  bag  as  a  source  of  bladder
bacteriuria and environmental contamination 675. Although the instillation of hydrogen
peroxide into the bag reduced microbial contamination of the bag, this procedure did
not  reduce  the  incidence  of  catheter-associated  bacteriuria  675.  A  chemical  irritation
resembling pseudomembranous colitis caused by either 3% hydrogen peroxide or a 2%
glutaraldehyde has been reported 621. An epidemic of pseudomembrane-like enteritis
and  colitis  in  seven  patients  in  a  gastrointestinal  endoscopy  unit  also  has  been
associated with inadequate rinsing of 3% hydrogen peroxide from the endoscope 676.
As with other chemical sterilants, dilution of the hydrogen peroxide must be monitored
by
 regularly
 testing
 the
 minimum
 effective
 concentration
 (i.e.,
 7.5%–6.0%).
Compatibility testing by Olympus America of the 7.5% hydrogen peroxide found both
cosmetic  changes  (e.g.,  discoloration  of  black  anodized  metal  finishes)  69  and
functional  changes  with  the  tested  endoscopes  (Olympus,  written  communication,
October  15,  1999).  Iodine  solutions  or  tinctures  long  have  been  used  by  health
professionals primarily as antiseptics on skin or tissue. Iodophors, on the other hand,
have been used both as antiseptics and disinfectants. FDA has not cleared any liquid
chemical  sterilant  or  high-level  disinfectants  with  iodophors  as  the  main  active
ingredient. An iodophor is a combination of iodine and a solubilizing agent or carrier;
the  resulting  complex  provides  a  sustained-release  reservoir  of  iodine  and  releases
small amounts of free iodine in aqueous solution. The best-known and most widely used
iodophor  is  povidone-iodine,  a  compound  of  polyvinylpyrrolidone  with  iodine.  This
product and other iodophors retain the germicidal efficacy of iodine but unlike iodine
generally are nonstaining and relatively free of toxicity and irritancy 677, 678. Several
reports that documented intrinsic microbial contamination of antiseptic formulations of
povidone-iodine and poloxamer-iodine 679-681 caused a reappraisal of the chemistry
and  use  of  iodophors682.  "Free"  iodine  (I2)  contributes  to  the  bactericidal  activity  of

iodophors and dilutions of iodophors demonstrate more rapid bactericidal action than
does  a  full-strength  povidone-iodine  solution.  The  reason  for  the  observation  that
dilution increases bactericidal activity is unclear, but dilution of povidone-iodine might
weaken the iodine linkage to the carrier polymer with an accompanying increase of free
iodine  in  solution  680.  Therefore,  iodophors  must  be  diluted  according  to  the
manufacturers' directions to achieve antimicrobial activity. Iodine can penetrate the cell
wall  of  microorganisms  quickly,  and  the  lethal  effects  are  believed  to  result  from
disruption of protein and nucleic acid structure and synthesis. Published reports on the
in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of iodophors demonstrate that iodophors are bactericidal,
mycobactericidal, and virucidal but can require prolonged contact times to kill certain
fungi  and  bacterial  spores  14,  71-73,  290,  683-686.  Three  brands  of  povidone-iodine
solution have demonstrated more rapid kill (seconds to minutes) of S. aureus and M.
chelonae at a 1:100 dilution than did the stock solution 683. The virucidal activity of
75–150  ppm  available  iodine  was  demonstrated  against  seven  viruses  72.  Other
investigators  have  questioned  the  efficacy  of  iodophors  against  poliovirus  in  the
presence  of  organic  matter  685and  rotavirus  SA-11  in  distilled  or  tapwater  290.
Manufacturers'  data  demonstrate  that  commercial  iodophors  are  not  sporicidal,  but
they  are  tuberculocidal,  fungicidal,  virucidal,  and  bactericidal  at  their  recommended
use-dilution.  Besides  their  use  as  an  antiseptic,  iodophors  have  been  used  for
disinfecting blood culture bottles and medical equipment, such as hydrotherapy tanks,
thermometers,  and  endoscopes.  Antiseptic  iodophors  are  not  suitable  for  use  as
hard-surface disinfectants because of concentration differences. Iodophors formulated
as antiseptics contain less free iodine than do those formulated as disinfectants 376.
Iodine  or  iodine-based  antiseptics  should  not  be  used  on  silicone  catheters  because
they can adversely affect the silicone tubing 687. Ortho-phthalaldehyde is a high-level
disinfectant  that  received  FDA  clearance  in  October  1999.  It  contains  0.55%
1,2-benzenedicarboxaldehyde (OPA). OPA solution is a clear, pale-blue liquid with a pH

of 7.5. (Tables 4 and 5) Preliminary studies on the mode of action of OPA suggest that
both OPA and glutaraldehyde interact with amino acids, proteins, and microorganisms.
However,  OPA  is  a  less  potent  cross-linking  agent.  This  is  compensated  for  by  the
lipophilic  aromatic  nature  of  OPA  that  is  likely  to  assist  its  uptake  through  the  outer
layers of mycobacteria and gram-negative bacteria 688-690. OPA appears to kill spores
by blocking the spore germination process 691. Studies have demonstrated excellent
microbicidal activity in vitro 69, 100, 271, 400, 692-703. For example, OPA has superior
mycobactericidal activity (5-log10 reduction in 5 minutes) to glutaraldehyde. The mean
times  required  to  produce  a  6-log10  reduction  for  M.  bovis  using  0.21%  OPA  was  6
minutes, compared with 32 minutes using 1.5% glutaraldehyde 693. OPA showed good
activity against the mycobacteria tested, including the glutaraldehyde-resistant strains,
but 0.5% OPA was not sporicidal with 270 minutes of exposure. Increasing the pH from
its unadjusted level (about 6.5) to pH 8 improved the sporicidal activity of OPA 694. The
level of biocidal activity was directly related to the temperature. A greater than 5-log10
reduction of B. atrophaeus spores was observed in 3 hours at 35°C, than in 24 hours at
20°C.  Also,  with  an  exposure  time  ≤5  minutes,  biocidal  activity  decreased  with
increasing  serum  concentration.  However,  efficacy  did  not  differ  when  the  exposure
time was ≥10 minutes 697. In addition, OPA is effective (>5-log10 reduction) against a
wide range of microorganisms, including glutaraldehyde-resistant mycobacteria and B.
atrophaeus spores 694. The influence of laboratory adaptation of test strains, such as P.
aeruginosa,  to  0.55%  OPA  has  been  evaluated.  Resistant  and  multiresistant  strains
increased  substantially  in  susceptibility  to  OPA  after  laboratory  adaptation  (log10
reduction  factors  increased  by  0.54  and  0.91  for  resistant  and  multiresistant  strains,
respectively) 704. Other studies have found naturally occurring cells of P. aeurginosa
were more resistant to a variety of disinfectants than were subcultured cells 705. OPA
has several potential advantages over glutaraldehyde. It has excellent stability over a
wide pH range (pH 3–9), is not a known irritant to the eyes and nasal passages 706,

does not require exposure monitoring, has a barely perceptible odor, and requires no
activation.  OPA,  like  glutaraldehyde,  has  excellent  material  compatibility.  A  potential
disadvantage of OPA is that it stains proteins gray (including unprotected skin) and thus
must  be  handled  with  caution  69.  However,  skin  staining  would  indicate  improper
handling  that  requires  additional  training  and/or  personal  protective  equipment  (e.g.,
gloves, eye and mouth protection, and fluid-resistant gowns). OPA residues remaining
on  inadequately  water-rinsed  transesophageal  echo  probes  can  stain  the  patient's
mouth 707. Meticulous cleaning, using the correct OPA exposure time (e.g., 12 minutes)
and copious rinsing of the probe with water should eliminate this problem. The results
of  one  study  provided  a  basis  for  a  recommendation  that  rinsing  of  instruments
disinfected  with  OPA  will  require  at  least  250  mL  of  water  per  channel  to  reduce  the
chemical residue to a level that will not compromise patient or staff safety (<1 ppm)
708.  Personal  protective  equipment  should  be  worn  when  contaminated  instruments,
equipment, and chemicals are handled 400. In addition, equipment must be thoroughly
rinsed to prevent discoloration of a patient's skin or mucous membrane. In April 2004,
the  manufacturer  of  OPA  disseminated  information  to  users  about  patients  who
reportedly experienced an anaphylaxis-like reaction after cystoscopy where the scope
had  been  reprocessed  using  OPA.  Of  approximately  1  million  urologic  procedures
performed using instruments reprocessed using OPA, 24 cases (17 cases in the United
States, six in Japan, one in the United Kingdom) of anaphylaxis-like reactions have been
reported after repeated cystoscopy (typically after four to nine treatments). Preventive
measures include removal of OPA residues by thorough rinsing and not using OPA for
reprocessing urologic instrumentation used to treat patients with a history of bladder
cancer  (Nevine  Erian,  personal  communication,  June  4,  2004;  Product  Notification,
Advanced  Sterilization  Products,  April  23,  2004)  709.  A  few  OPA  clinical  studies  are
available.  In  a  clinical-use  study,  OPA  exposure  of  100  endoscopes  for  5  minutes
resulted in a >5-log10 reduction in bacterial load. Furthermore, OPA was effective over

a  14-day  use  cycle  100.  Manufacturer  data  show  that  OPA  will  last  longer  in  an
automatic endoscope reprocessor before reaching its MEC limit (MEC after 82 cycles)
than
 will
 glutaraldehyde
 (MEC
 after
 40
 cycles)
 400.
 High-pressure
 liquid
chromatography confirmed that OPA levels are maintained above 0.3% for at least 50
cycles 706, 710. OPA must be disposed in accordance with local and state regulations.
If  OPA  disposal  through  the  sanitary  sewer  system  is  restricted,  glycine  (25
grams/gallon)  can  be  used  to  neutralize  the  OPA  and  make  it  safe  for  disposal.  The
high-level  disinfectant  label  claims  for  OPA  solution  at  20°C  vary  worldwide  (e.g.,  5
minutes in Europe, Asia, and Latin America; 10 minutes in Canada and Australia; and 12
minutes  in  the  United  States).  These  label  claims  differ  worldwide  because  of
differences  in  the  test  methodology  and  requirements  for  licensure.  In  an  automated
endoscope
 reprocessor
 with
 an
 FDA-cleared
 capability
 to
 maintain
 solution
temperatures at 25°C, the contact time for OPA is 5 minutes. Peracetic, or peroxyacetic,
acid is characterized by rapid action against all microorganisms. Special advantages of
peracetic acid are that it lacks harmful decomposition products (i.e., acetic acid, water,
oxygen, hydrogen peroxide), enhances removal of organic material 711, and leaves no
residue. It remains effective in the presence of organic matter and is sporicidal even at
low temperatures (Tables 4 and 5). Peracetic acid can corrode copper, brass, bronze,
plain steel, and galvanized iron but these effects can be reduced by additives and pH
modifications.  It  is  considered  unstable,  particularly  when  diluted;  for  example,  a  1%
solution loses half its strength through hydrolysis in 6 days, whereas 40% peracetic acid
loses  1%–2%  of  its  active  ingredients  per  month  654.  Little  is  known  about  the
mechanism of action of peracetic acid, but it is believed to function similarly to other
oxidizing agents—that is, it denatures proteins, disrupts the cell wall permeability, and
oxidizes sulfhydryl and sulfur bonds in proteins, enzymes, and other metabolites 654.
Peracetic  acid  will  inactivate  gram-positive  and  gram-negative  bacteria,  fungi,  and
yeasts in ≤5 minutes at <100 ppm. In the presence of organic matter, 200–500 ppm is

required.  For  viruses,  the  dosage  range  is  wide  (12–2250  ppm),  with  poliovirus
inactivated in yeast extract in 15 minutes with 1,500–2,250 ppm. In one study, 3.5%
peracetic acid was ineffective against HAV after 1-minute exposure using a carrier test
58.  Peracetic  acid  (0.26%)  was  effective  (log10  reduction  factor  >5)  against  all  test
strains of mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis, M. avium-intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M.
fortuitum)  within  20–30  minutes  in  the  presence  or  absence  of  an  organic  load  607,
712.  With  bacterial  spores,  500–10,000  ppm  (0.05%–1%)  inactivates  spores  in  15
seconds to 30 minutes using a spore suspension test 654, 659, 713-715. An automated
machine  using  peracetic  acid  to  chemically  sterilize  medical  (e.g.,  endoscopes,
arthroscopes), surgical, and dental instruments is used in the United States716-718. As
previously  noted,  dental  handpieces  should  be  steam  sterilized.  The  sterilant,  35%
peracetic acid, is diluted to 0.2% with filtered water at 50°C. Simulated-use trials have
demonstrated excellent microbicidal activity 111, 718-722, and three clinical trials have
demonstrated  both  excellent  microbial  killing  and  no  clinical  failures  leading  to
infection90,  723,  724.  The  high  efficacy  of  the  system  was  demonstrated  in  a
comparison  of  the  efficacies  of  the  system  with  that  of  ethylene  oxide.  Only  the
peracetic  acid  system  completely  killed  6  log10  of  M.  chelonae,  E.  faecalis,  and  B.
atrophaeus spores with both an organic and inorganic challenge722. An investigation
that  compared  the  costs,  performance,  and  maintenance  of  urologic  endoscopic
equipment processed by high-level disinfection (with glutaraldehyde) with those of the
peracetic  acid  system  reported  no  clinical  differences  between  the  two  systems.
However,  the  use  of  this  system  led  to  higher  costs  than  the  high-level  disinfection,
including  costs  for  processing  ($6.11  vs.  $0.45  per  cycle),  purchasing  and  training
($24,845 vs. $16), installation ($5,800 vs. $0), and endoscope repairs ($6,037 vs. $445)
90.  Furthermore,  three  clusters  of  infection  using  the  peracetic  acid  automated
endoscope  reprocessor  were  linked  to  inadequately  processed  bronchoscopes  when
inappropriate  channel  connectors  were  used  with  the  system  725.  These  clusters

highlight  the  importance  of  training,  proper  model-specific  endoscope  connector
systems,  and  quality-control  procedures  to  ensure  compliance  with  endoscope
manufacturer
 recommendations
 and
 professional
 organization
 guidelines.
 An
alternative  high-level  disinfectant  available  in  the  United  Kingdom  contains  0.35%
peracetic  acid.  Although  this  product  is  rapidly  effective  against  a  broad  range  of
microorganisms  466,  726,  727,  it  tarnishes  the  metal  of  endoscopes  and  is  unstable,
resulting  in  only  a  24-hour  use  life  727.  Two  chemical  sterilants  are  available  that
contain  peracetic  acid  plus  hydrogen  peroxide  (i.e.,  0.08%  peracetic  acid  plus  1.0%
hydrogen  peroxide  [no  longer  marketed];  and  0.23%  peracetic  acid  plus  7.35%
hydrogen peroxide (Tables 4 and 5). The bactericidal properties of peracetic acid and
hydrogen peroxide have been demonstrated 728. Manufacturer data demonstrated this
combination  of  peracetic  acid  and  hydrogen  peroxide  inactivated  all  microorganisms
except  bacterial  spores  within  20  minutes.  The  0.08%  peracetic  acid  plus  1.0%
hydrogen
 peroxide
 product
 effectively
 inactivated
 glutaraldehyde-resistant
mycobacteria729. The combination of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide has been
used  for  disinfecting  hemodialyzers  730.  The  percentage  of  dialysis  centers  using  a
peracetic  acid-hydrogen  peroxide-based  disinfectant  for  reprocessing  dialyzers
increased from 5% in 1983 to 56% in 1997249. Olympus America does not endorse use
of  0.08%  peracetic  acid  plus  1.0%  hydrogen  peroxide  (Olympus  America,  personal
communication, April 15, 1998) on any Olympus endoscope because of cosmetic and
functional damage and will not assume liability for chemical damage resulting from use
of  this  product.  This  product  is  not  currently  available.  FDA  has  cleared  a  newer
chemical  sterilant  with  0.23%  peracetic  acid  and  7.35%  hydrogen  peroxide  (Tables  4
and 5). After testing the 7.35% hydrogen peroxide and 0.23% peracetic acid product,
Olympus  America  concluded  it  was  not  compatible  with  the  company's  flexible
gastrointestinal endoscopes; this conclusion was based on immersion studies where the
test insertion tubes had failed because of swelling and loosening of the black polymer

layer  of  the  tube  (Olympus  America,  personal  communication,  September  13,  2000).
Phenol  has  occupied  a  prominent  place  in  the  field  of  hospital  disinfection  since  its
initial use as a germicide by Lister in his pioneering work on antiseptic surgery. In the
past 30 years, however, work has concentrated on the numerous phenol derivatives or
phenolics  and  their  antimicrobial  properties.  Phenol  derivatives  originate  when  a
functional  group  (e.g.,  alkyl,  phenyl,  benzyl,  halogen)  replaces  one  of  the  hydrogen
atoms on the aromatic ring. Two phenol derivatives commonly found as constituents of
hospital disinfectants are ortho-phenylphenol and ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol. The
antimicrobial  properties  of  these  compounds  and  many  other  phenol  derivatives  are
much improved over those of the parent chemical. Phenolics are absorbed by porous
materials, and the residual disinfectant can irritate tissue. In 1970, depigmentation of
the  skin  was  reported  to  be  caused  by  phenolic  germicidal  detergents  containing
para-tertiary  butylphenol  and  para-tertiary  amylphenol  731.  In  high  concentrations,
phenol acts as a gross protoplasmic poison, penetrating and disrupting the cell wall and
precipitating
 the
 cell
 proteins.
 Low
 concentrations
 of
 phenol
 and
 higher
molecular-weight phenol derivatives cause bacterial death by inactivation of essential
enzyme systems and leakage of essential metabolites from the cell wall 732. Published
reports  on  the  antimicrobial  efficacy  of  commonly  used  phenolics  showed  they  were
bactericidal,  fungicidal,  virucidal,  and  tuberculocidal  14,  61,  71,  73,  227,  416,  573,
732-738.  One  study  demonstrated  little  or  no  virucidal  effect  of  a  phenolic  against
coxsackie  B4,  echovirus  11,  and  poliovirus  1  736.  Similarly,  12%  ortho-phenylphenol
failed  to  inactivate  any  of  the  three  hydrophilic  viruses  after  a  10-minute  exposure
time, although 5% phenol was lethal for these viruses 72. A 0.5% dilution of a phenolic
(2.8%  ortho-phenylphenol  and  2.7%  ortho-benzyl-para-chlorophenol)  inactivated  HIV
227  and  a  2%  solution  of  a  phenolic  (15%  ortho-phenylphenol  and  6.3%
para-tertiary-amylphenol) inactivated all but one of 11 fungi tested 71. Manufacturers'
data using the standardized AOAC methods demonstrate that commercial phenolics are

not  sporicidal  but  are  tuberculocidal,  fungicidal,  virucidal,  and  bactericidal  at  their
recommended  use-dilution.  Attempts  to  substantiate  the  bactericidal  label  claims  of
phenolics  using  the  AOAC  Use-Dilution  Method  occasionally  have  failed  416,  737.
However, results from these same studies have varied dramatically among laboratories
testing identical products. Many phenolic germicides are EPA-registered as disinfectants
for  use  on  environmental  surfaces  (e.g.,  bedside  tables,  bedrails,  and  laboratory
surfaces) and noncritical medical devices. Phenolics are not FDA-cleared as high-level
disinfectants  for  use  with  semicritical  items  but  could  be  used  to  preclean  or
decontaminate critical and semicritical devices before terminal sterilization or high-level
disinfection.  The  use  of  phenolics  in  nurseries  has  been  questioned  because  of
hyperbilirubinemia in infants placed in bassinets where phenolic detergents were used
739. In addition, bilirubin levels were reported to increase in phenolic-exposed infants,
compared  with  nonphenolic-exposed  infants,  when  the  phenolic  was  prepared
according  to  the  manufacturers'  recommended  dilution  740.  If  phenolics  are  used  to
clean  nursery  floors,  they  must  be  diluted  as  recommended  on  the  product  label.
Phenolics  (and  other  disinfectants)  should  not  be  used  to  clean  infant  bassinets  and
incubators while occupied. If phenolics are used to terminally clean infant bassinets and
incubators, the surfaces should be rinsed thoroughly with water and dried before reuse
of  infant  bassinets  and  incubators  17.  The  quaternary  ammonium  compounds  are
widely  used  as  disinfectants.  Health-care–associated  infections  have  been  reported
from  contaminated  quaternary  ammonium  compounds  used  to  disinfect  patient-care
supplies  or  equipment,  such  as  cystoscopes  or  cardiac  catheters  741,  742.  The
quaternaries are good cleaning agents, but high water hardness 743 and materials such
as  cotton  and  gauze  pads  can  make  them  less  microbicidal  because  of  insoluble
precipitates or cotton and gauze pads absorb the active ingredients, respectively. One
study showed a significant decline (~40%–50% lower at 1 hour) in the concentration of
quaternaries  released  when  cotton  rags  or  cellulose-based  wipers  were  used  in  the

open-bucket  system,  compared  with  the  nonwoven  spunlace  wipers  in  the
closed-bucket  system.744  As  with  several  other  disinfectants  (e.g.,  phenolics,
iodophors)  gram-negative  bacteria  can  survive  or  grow  in  them  404.  Chemically,  the
quaternaries are organically substituted ammonium compounds in which the nitrogen
atom  has  a  valence  of  5,  four  of  the  substituent  radicals  (R1-R4)  are  alkyl  or
heterocyclic  radicals  of  a  given  size  or  chain  length,  and  the  fifth  (X-)  is  a  halide,
sulfate,  or  similar  radical  745.  Each  compound  exhibits  its  own  antimicrobial
characteristics,  hence  the  search  for  one  compound  with  outstanding  antimicrobial
properties. Some of the chemical names of quaternary ammonium compounds used in
healthcare  are  alkyl  dimethyl  benzyl  ammonium  chloride,  alkyl  didecyl  dimethyl
ammonium  chloride,  and  dialkyl  dimethyl  ammonium  chloride.  The  newer  quaternary
ammonium  compounds  (i.e.,  fourth  generation),  referred  to  as  twin-chain  or  dialkyl
quaternaries  (e.g.  didecyl  dimethyl  ammonium  bromide  and  dioctyl  dimethyl
ammonium  bromide),  purportedly  remain  active  in  hard  water  and  are  tolerant  of
anionic residues 746. A few case reports have documented occupational asthma as a
result  of  exposure  to  benzalkonium  chloride  747.  The  bactericidal  action  of  the
quaternaries  has  been  attributed  to  the  inactivation  of  energy-producing  enzymes,
denaturation  of  essential  cell  proteins,  and  disruption  of  the  cell  membrane746.
Evidence  exists  that  supports  these  and  other  possibilities  745  748.  Results  from
manufacturers'  data  sheets  and  from  published  scientific  literature  indicate  that  the
quaternaries  sold  as  hospital  disinfectants  are  generally  fungicidal,  bactericidal,  and
virucidal against lipophilic (enveloped) viruses; they are not sporicidal and generally not
tuberculocidal or virucidal against hydrophilic (nonenveloped) viruses14, 54-56, 58, 59,
61,  71,  73,  186,  297,  748,  749.  The  poor  mycobactericidal  activities  of  quaternary
ammonium  compounds  have  been  demonstrated  55,  73.  Quaternary  ammonium
compounds (as well as 70% isopropyl alcohol, phenolic, and a chlorine-containing wipe
[80
 ppm])
 effectively
 (>95%)
 remove
 and/or
 inactivate
 contaminants
 (i.e.,

multidrug-resistant  S.  aureus,  vancomycin-resistant  Entercoccus,  P.  aeruginosa)  from
computer  keyboards  with  a  5-second  application  time.  No  functional  damage  or
cosmetic  changes  occurred  to  the  computer  keyboards  after  300  applications  of  the
disinfectants  45.  Attempts  to  reproduce  the  manufacturers'  bactericidal  and
tuberculocidal  claims  using  the  AOAC  tests  with  a  limited  number  of  quaternary
ammonium  compounds  occasionally  have  failed  73,  416,  737.  However,  test  results
have  varied  extensively  among  laboratories  testing  identical  products  416,  737.  The
quaternaries  commonly  are  used  in  ordinary  environmental  sanitation  of  noncritical
surfaces,  such  as  floors,  furniture,  and  walls.  EPA-registered  quaternary  ammonium
compounds  are  appropriate  to  use  for  disinfecting  medical  equipment  that  contacts
intact  skin  (e.g.,  blood  pressure  cuffs).  CDC  provides  information  on  infection  control
and  clinical  safety  to  help  reduce  the  risk  of  infections  among  healthcare  workers,
patients,  and  visitors.  Languages  Language  Assistance  Languages   Language
