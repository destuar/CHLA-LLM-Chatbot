the human intestines, female genital tract and environment (e.g., soil and water). VRE
are  resistant  to  vancomycin,  the  drug  often  used  to  treat  infections  caused  by
enterococci. Most VRE infections occur in hospitals.  In 2017, VRE caused an estimated
54,500  infections  among  hospitalized  patients  and  5,400  estimated  deaths  in  the
United States.1 VRE does not spread through the air by coughing or sneezing. Patients
and caregivers should: Healthcare providers should always follow core infection control
practices  to  reduce  the  risk  of  spreading  these  germs  to  patients.  VRE  infections  are
treated with antibiotics other than vancomycin. To pick the best antibiotic, healthcare
providers will send a specimen to the laboratory.  In some cases, people can carry VRE
without being infected, known as colonization. Colonization does not require antibiotics.
VRE spreads easily in healthcare settings, but infections can be prevented. Antibiotics
