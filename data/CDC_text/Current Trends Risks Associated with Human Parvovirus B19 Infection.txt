and the title of the report in the subject line of e-mail. This report* was developed to
assist physicians, public health
officials, and other health-care professionals respond to public
concerns about recently recognized, serious complications of human
parvovirus B19 (B19) infection, including transient aplastic crisis
(TAC), chronic anemia, and fetal death. It includes background
information about the virus, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis,
epidemiology, and diagnostic testing. In addition, interim
 guidelines
are presented for preventing B19 infection, managing persons
 exposed to
persons with B19 infection, and managing patients infected with
 B19.
These guidelines reflect both the current limited information about
 the
extent to which B19 infection leads to severe complications and the
limited availability of diagnostic testing. Priorities for future
research are identified.
GENERAL INFORMATION  B19 was discovered in England in 1975 in serum specimens
from
 healthy
blood donors (1). Since its discovery, B19 has been shown to be the

causative agent of erythema infectiosum (EI) (also known as fifth
disease) and is the primary etiologic agent of TAC in patients with
chronic hemolytic anemias (2-4). B19 has also been associated with
fetal death (both spontaneous abortions and stillbirths), acute
arthralgias and arthritis, and chronic anemia in immunodeficient
patients (5-14).  The virus belongs to the family Parvoviridae, which includes two
genera of vertebrate viruses: genus parvovirus (autonomously
replicating parvoviruses) and genus dependovirus (parvoviruses that
require a helper virus, such as adenovirus or herpes virus, for
replication); and one genus of invertebrate viruses, the genus
densovirus (15). B19 is in the genus parvovirus, which includes a
number of animal parvoviruses such as the canine parvovirus and
 feline
panleukopenia virus. The parvoviruses tend to be species-specific;
 only
the adeno-associated parvoviruses (members of the dependovirus
 genus)
and B19 are known to infect humans. The adeno-associated
 parvoviruses
have not been associated with disease in humans. Fecal parvoviruses
 and
the RA1 virus have been reported but not confirmed to be human
pathogens (16,17). B19 is a heat-stable virus and can survive at 60
 C

(140 F) for up to 12 hours.
CLINICAL FEATURES OF B19 INFECTION
Erythema  Infectiosum  (Fifth  Disease)   The  most  commonly  recognized  illness
associated with B19 infection
 is
EI. EI is a mild childhood illness characterized by a facial rash
("slapped cheek" appearance), and a reticulated or lacelike rash on
 the
trunk and extremities (18). Reappearance of the rash may occur for
several weeks following nonspecific stimuli such as change in
temperature, sunlight, and emotional stress. Typically, the patient
 is
otherwise well at rash onset but often gives a history of mild
 systemic
symptoms 1-4 days before rash onset. In some EI outbreaks, pruritis
 has
been a common clinical feature. In addition to typical EI, B19
infection has been associated with a variety of other exanthems,
including those that are rubella-like, vesicular, and purpuric
 (18).
Asymptomatic Infection  In outbreak investigations, asymptomatic infection has been
 reported
in approximately 20% of children and adults (19,20).
Arthropathy  In some outbreaks of EI, arthralgias and arthritis have been
 commonly
reported (7,8,21). Infection may produce a symmetrical peripheral
polyarthropathy. Joints in the hands are most frequently affected,

followed by the knees and wrists. Symptoms are usually self-limited
 but
may persist for several months. Joint symptoms, more common in
 adults,
may occur as the sole manifestation of infection.
Transient Aplastic Crisis and Severe Anemia  B19 is the primary etiologic agent causing
TAC in patients with
chronic hemolytic anemias (e.g., sickle cell disease, hemoglobin SC
disease, hereditary spherocytosis, alpha-thalassemia, and
 autoimmune
hemolytic anemia) (22,23). It can also cause TAC in other
 conditions in
which increased red cell production is necessary to maintain stable
 red
cell indices, as may occur in anemia due to blood loss. Patients
 with
TAC typically present with pallor, weakness, and lethargy and may
report a nonspecific prodromal illness in the preceding 1-7 days.
 Few
patients with TAC report a rash. In the acute phase of the illness,
patients usually have a moderate to severe anemia with absence f
reticulocytes, and bone marrow examination shows a hypoplastic or
 an
aplastic erythroid series with a normal myeloid series. Recovery is

indicated by a return of reticulocytes in the peripheral smear
approximately 7-10 days after their disappearance. TAC may require
transfusion and hospitalization and can be fatal if not treated
promptly.
B19  Infection  in  Immunodeficient  Patients   A  B19-related  severe  chronic  anemia
associated with red cell
 aplasia
has been described in patients on maintenance chemotherapy for
 acute
lymphocytic leukemia, patients with congenital immunodeficiencies,
 and
patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related
immunodeficiency (9-14). It is not yet known how often B19 causes
chronic anemia in immunodeficient patients or which patients are
 most
susceptible to this complication of infection. Chronic B19
 infection
should, however, be included in the differential diagnosis of
 chronic
anemia in the immunodeficient patient.
Infection in the Pregnant Woman
Intrauterine infection and fetal death  In most of the reported B19 infections occurring
during pregnancy,
 the
fetus has not been adversely affected (5,6,24-30). However, in some

cases B19 infection has been associated with fetal death. The risk
 of
fetal death attributable to parvovirus infection following
 documented
maternal infection (B19 IgM-antibody-positive) is not known, but
preliminary results of one study from the United Kingdom suggest
 that
it is less than 10% (30; SM Hall, unpublished data). In that study,
 174
pregnant women with IgM antibody to B19 were followed prospectively
 to
delivery. Fetal loss occurred in 30 (17.2%): 21 (19.1%) of 110
 women
infected during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, seven (15.2%) of
 46
women infected during weeks 13-20, one (6.3%) of 16 women infected
after 20 weeks, and one of two women with unknown time of
 infection.
Fetal death most commonly occurred from the 10th through the 20th
 weeks
of pregnancy. Not all fetal deaths directly resulted from B19
infection. Since this study did not include a control group, the
 number
of deaths attributable to B19 infection cannot be calculated
 directly.
In other studies, rates of recognized pregnancies ending in
 spontaneous

abortions from all causes by 28 weeks' gestation range from 10% to
 25%
(31). In the British study, the number of fetal deaths linked to
 B19
infection can be estimated by determining whether fetal tissues
 contain
B19 DNA. Tissues from 14 fetuses were tested for B19 DNA: six were
positive, two were equivocal, and six were negative. The cause of
 death
is likely to have been B19 infection for the DNA-positive fetuses;
thus, at least six (3.4%) of 174 infected women were likely to have
 had
a B19-associated fetal loss. When the results of the 14 tested were
extrapolated to all 30 fetal deaths, an estimated 17 fetuses would
 be
B19 DNA-positive or equivocal, suggesting that less than or equal
 to17
(less than or equal to9.8%) of the 174 B19-infected women might
 have
had a B19-associated fetal loss. Antibody studies of liveborn
 infants
and hybridization studies of fetal tissues indicate that less than
 one
third of maternal infections are associated with fetal infection in
this study.  Results from an ongoing study in the United States also suggest

 that
B19- attributable fetal deaths are infrequent (CDC, unpublished
 data).
In this study, 95 pregnant women with IgM antibody to B19 are being
followed prospectively. Fetal loss has so far occurred in two
 (4.1%) of
49 women followed to term. It is not known whether the two fetal
 deaths
were caused by B19 infection. One fetus was hydropic; the other was
 not
described. No tissues from either fetus were available for B19
hybridization studies.  When the antibody status of the woman is unknown, estimates of
the
risk of fetal death after exposure must take into account the rate
 of
susceptibility in the population and the risk of infection after
 the
exposure. For example, by taking these factors into account, the
 upper
limit estimate of the risk of fetal death would be less than 2.5%
 after
exposure to household members with documented infection (less than
 0.1
risk of fetal death x 0.5 rate of susceptibility x 0.5 rate of
infection x 100; see sections on Epidemiologic Features of B19

Infection: Prevalence and Transmission) and less than 1.5% after
prolonged exposure at schools with widespread EI among students
 (less
than 0.1 risk of fetal death x 0.5 rate of susceptibility x 0.3
 rate of
infection x 100). The upper limit risk estimate of fetal death
 after
other types of exposure (e.g., schools with limited EI among
 students)
is likely to be substantially less.  A study of 96 women who had stillbirths, 96 women
who had
 spontaneous
abortions, and controls matched by age, duration of pregnancy, and
location suggests that B19 is not responsible for a substantial
proportion of fetal deaths in the general population (32). In this
study, the rate of serologically confirmed B19 infection was the
 same
(1%) in cases and controls. In a survey of 50 fetuses with
nonimmunologic hydrops fetalis, an uncommonly diagnosed cause of
 fetal
death, four (8%) were positive for B19 DNA (25).
Congenital anomalies  Since some of the animal parvoviruses are teratogens (33), the
possibility that infection may also be associated with congenital
anomalies in humans is a concern. However, there is no evidence
 that

the rate of congenital anomalies following B19 infection exceeds
background rates. B19-associated congenital anomalies have not been
reported among several hundred liveborn infants of B19-infected
mothers. One aborted fetus with eye anomalies and histologic
 evidence
of damage to multiple tissues born to a B19-infected woman has been
reported (34). An anencephalic fetus was reported in a B19-infected
woman, but the timing of infection made it unlikely that B19
contributed to the defect (35).
ATHOGENESIS  The pathogenesis of the rash in EI is unknown, but the rash may be
immune- complex-mediated. The other, more serious manifestations of
 B19
infection are related to the propensity of the virus to infect and
 lyse
erythroid precursor cells and interrupt normal red cell production
(36). In a person with normal hematopoiesis, B19 infection produces
 a
self-limited red cell aplasia that is clinically inapparent.
 Transient
leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia have also been
reported with B19 infection in the normal host (37,38).  In patients who have increased
rates of red cell destruction or
 loss

and who depend on compensatory increases in red cell production to
maintain stable red cell indices, B19 infection may lead to TAC.
Patients at risk for TAC include those with chronic hemolytic
 anemias
and those with anemias associated with acute or chronic blood loss.
 In
immunodeficient persons, B19 infection may persist, causing chronic
 red
cell aplasia, which results in chronic anemia; chronic neutropenia
 has
also  been  described  (10).   B19  DNA-positive  tissues  have  been  reported  in  20  fetal
deaths; in
 all
17 cases in which pathologic findings were described, the fetuses
 had
nonimmunologic hydrops fetalis (6,25-27,30,35,39-44). The precise
pathogenesis of fetal death remains unclear. Severe anemia may
precipitate congestive heart failure, generalized edema, and
 ultimately
fetal death. The fetus may be particularly vulnerable to B19
 infection
because red cell survival is short, and the red cell volume is
 rapidly
expanding. Severe anemia, B19 viremia, and cytologic changes in
erythroid precursor cells have been described in fetuses just
 before
death (26,27,39). Chronic infection may occur in the fetus (one

 fetus
was viremic for at least 4 weeks) (26). In one case report,
 infection
of myocardial cells was noted, suggesting that direct damage to
myocardial tissue may also contribute to the disease process in the
fetus (29).
EPIDEMIOLOGIC FEATURES OF B19 INFECTION
Prevalence  B19 infection occurs worldwide (45,46). Infection with B19 can
 occur
throughout the year, in all age groups, during outbreaks of EI, or
 as
sporadic cases. B19 infection is most frequently recognized during
outbreaks of EI in schools. These outbreaks often begin in late
 winter
or early spring and may continue until school recesses for the
 summer.
The level of EI activity in a community varies from year to year;
periods of increased activity lasting several years are generally
followed by several years of decreased activity (47-50). The
 reported
seroprevalence ranges from 2% to 15% in children 1-5 years old, 15%
 to
60% in children 5-19 years old, and 30% to 60% in adults
 (18,40,51,52).
Incubation Period  Studies of secondary illness in households suggest that the
 incubation

period for clinical EI and TAC is usually 4-14 days but can be as
 long
as 20 days (18). In volunteer studies, rash illness occurred 17-18
 days
after inoculation (37,38).
Transmission  B19 DNA has been found in respiratory secretions in viremic
 patients,
which suggests that these secretions are involved in transmission
(19,20,37). In studies of human volunteers, serum and respiratory
secretions became positive for B19 DNA 5-10 days after intranasal
inoculation (during the prodromal illness) (37,38). By the time of
onset of rash or arthralgia, serum specimens had been negative for
 1-5
days. B19 has not been detected in the respiratory secretions and
 only
rarely in the serum of patients after onset of EI (37). In
 contrast,
acute serum specimens are often positive for B19 DNA in patients
 when
they present with TAC; serum specimens are usually negative by 7
 days
after onset of illness (53). The presence of B19 DNA in serum or
respiratory secretions presumably correlates with infectiousness;
 thus,
patients with EI are probably past the period of greatest
infectiousness, while patients with TAC are likely to be

infectious during the course of their illness.  The presence of IgG antibody correlates
with a lower risk of
infection. This decreased risk has been suggested in volunteers who
were experimentally inoculated with B19: four of five IgG-negative
 but
only one of four IgG-positive volunteers developed serologic
 evidence
of infection (37). The IgG-positive volunteer who became infected
 had
low levels of IgG antibody before challenge and had a lower titer
 and
shorter duration of viremia than had the four infected volunteers
 who
were IgG-negative.  The virus is transmitted effectively after close contact
 exposures.
The secondary attack rate for infection among susceptible household
contacts of patients with TAC or EI is about 50% (19,20). In school
outbreaks, 10%-60% of students may develop EI. In outbreaks in
 which
student involvement is widespread, preliminary data suggest 20%-30%
 of
susceptible (IgG-antibody-negative) staff may develop serologic
evidence of B19 infection during the course of the outbreak (CDC,
unpublished data).  In outbreak settings, it is not known whether the primary mode of

transmission involves direct person-to-person contact, fomites,
large-particle droplets, or small- particle droplets. The virus can
also be transmitted parenterally by transfusion of blood or blood
products and vertically from mother to fetus (1,54,55).
 Transmission
rarely occurs during transfusion with single-donor blood products
 but
is common during treatment with clotting-factor concentrates even
after steam- or dry-heat treatment of the clotting factor
 concentrate
(1,54,55). Tattooing was suspected as the source of B19
 transmission in
two instances (56).
DIAGNOSIS
B19 Antibody Assays  The most sensitive test to detect recent infection is the
 IgM-antibody
assay. B19 IgM antibody can be detected by capture-antibody
radioimmunoassay or enzyme immunoassay in approximately 90% of
 cases by
the third day after symptoms of TAC or EI begin (57,58). The titer
 and
the percentage of positives begin to decline 30-60 days after
 onset.
B19 IgG antibody is usually present by the seventh day of illness
 and
persists for years. B19 antibody may not be detectable in

immunodeficient patients with chronic B19 infection, and additional
testing for B19 DNA or viral antigens may be necessary to document
infection.  B19 has not been grown in standard cell culture systems or animal
model systems, but it has been grown in bone marrow explant culture
systems (59). The inability to grow the virus in sufficient
 quantity to
produce antigen for diagnostic assays has precluded widespread
availability of B19 testing (36,60,61). Recently parvovirus B19 DNA
 has
been incorporated into the genome of a Chinese hamster ovary cell
 line
(62). This cell line expresses B19 capsid proteins as noninfectious
virionlike particles that can be used as antigen for antibody
 assays;
this source of antigen should lead to increased availability of
diagnostic tests.
Assays for B19 DNA  The most sensitive test for detecting the virus is nucleic acid
hybridization (63,64). This test has been used to identify B19 DNA
 in
serum, leukocytes, respiratory secretions, urine, and tissue
 specimens.
One group reported that B19 DNA was more likely to be detected in
leukocytes than in serum (65).
Histologic  Features  of  B19  Infection   Light  and  electron  microscopy  can  be  helpful  in

diagnosing B19
infections (1,23,41) By light microscopy, eosinophilic nuclear
inclusions with peripheral condensation of chromatin can be seen in
erythroid precursor cells of infected patients. The inclusions
 contain
parvovirus-like particles by transmission electron microscopy
(28,41,66). B19-like particles may also be seen by electron
 microscopy
in serum specimens of some infected patients (1,23,41). Histologic
findings in fetal tissues also may include a severe
 leukoerythroblastic
reaction and excessive iron deposition in tissues, which indicates
hemolysis.
Assays  to  Determine  Site  of  Infection   It  is  not  known  which  tissues,  in  addition  to
erythroid precursor
cells, support virus replication. Several tests have been developed
that distinguish virus infection of tissue or cells from deposition
 of
virus by passive transfer in blood. In situ hybridization can
demonstrate viral DNA in specific cells and has been used to show
 that
B19 sometimes infects fetal myocardial cells (29). Replicative
 forms of
B19 DNA and nonstructural proteins can be demonstrated by Southern
 and

Western blot analysis, respectively, indicating infection in the
 tissue
(67,68).
PREVENTION OF INFECTION
Risk Groups  Although B19 infection usually produces a mild, self-limited
 illness,
three groups of persons are at risk for serious complications of
infection: 1) persons with chronic hemolytic anemias, 2) persons
 with
congenital or acquired immunodeficiencies, and 3) pregnant women.
 Since
infection in these persons can lead to substantial morbidity
and some mortality, consideration should be given to preventing or
ameliorating disease.
Immunization  Active  There is no vaccine to prevent B19, but a recently developed cell
 line
that expresses B19 capsid proteins as noninfectious viruslike
 particles
has been proposed as a source of antigen for development of a
 candidate
vaccine (62).
Passive  No studies have been conducted to determine whether preexposure or
postexposure prophylaxis with commercially available immune
 globulin

(IG) preparations would prevent infection or modify the course of
illness during community outbreaks. Routine prophylaxis with IG
 cannot
be recommended at this time.
Health-Care Settings  Guidelines for isolation precautions in hospitals have been
 published
for EI (69), but recent information suggests that these guidelines
should be modified. Most patients with EI are past their period of
infectiousness and do not present a risk for further transmission;
 thus
isolation precautions are not indicated. However, there is risk for
nosocomial transmission of B19 from patients with TAC and from
immunodeficient patients with chronic B19 infection. These patients
should be considered infectious and placed on isolation precautions
 for
the duration of their illness or until the infection has been
 cleared.
Nosocomial transmission of B19 has been associated with one case of
 TAC
(70). Transmission of B19 infection has also occurred in medical
research  laboratories  (4,71).   Patients  with  TAC  or  chronic  B19  infection  should  be
admitted to
private rooms. Persons in close contact with the patients should
 wear
masks. Gloves should be worn by persons likely to touch infective

material such as respiratory secretions, and gowns should be worn
 when
soiling is anticipated (contact isolation) (69). Hands should be
 washed
after the patient or potentially contaminated articles are touched
 and
before care is provided to another patient. B19-infected patients
 may
share a room with another B19-infected patient unless sharing is
contraindicated  by  another  infection  or  condition.   Health-care  workers  should  be
advised that they are at risk of B19
infection after exposure in the hospital or in the community and
 that
there may be a risk for further transmission to patients. Routine
infection-control practices should minimize the risk of
 transmission.  Personnel who may be pregnant or who might become pregnant should
 know
about potential risks to the fetus from B19 infection and about
preventive measures that may reduce those risks.  Homes, Schools,
 and
Workplaces  When outbreaks of B19 infection occur in situations in which
prolonged, close contact exposures occur (e.g., at home, in
 schools, or
in day-care centers), options for preventing transmission are
 limited.
The greatest risk of transmitting the virus occurs before symptoms

 of
EI develop; therefore, transmission cannot be prevented by
 identifying
and excluding persons with EI. The efficacy of decontaminating toys
 and
environmental surfaces to decrease B19 transmission has not been
studied. The efficacy of handwashing to decrease B19 transmission
 has
not been studied either, but handwashing is recommended as a
 practical
and  probably  effective  measure.   When  outbreaks  occur,  parents  of  school-aged
children and
 employees
should be advised about the risk of transmitting and acquiring
infection and about who is at risk for serious complications.
 Persons
who wish to obtain additional information about risks and
 management of
B19 exposures should be referred to their health-care provider and
state  or  local  health  officials.   The  decision  to  try  to  decrease  any  person's  risk  of
infection by
avoiding a workplace or school evironment in which an EI outbreak
 is
occurring should be made by the person after discussions with
 family
members, health-care providers, public health officials, and
 employers

or school officials. A policy to routinely exclude members of
 high-risk
groups is not recommended.
PATIENT MANAGEMENT
Patients  with  Chronic  Hemolytic  Anemia   The  exposed  patient  with  chronic  hemolytic
anemia should be
 managed by
alerting the patient or his/her parents or guardians about the
exposure, the symptoms and signs associated with TAC (pallor,
 weakness,
and lethargy), and the need to consult a physician immediately if
symptoms or signs of TAC develop. Management of the patient with
 TAC is
based on treating symptoms of the associated anemia and may require
blood transfusion.  Patients with Congenital and Acquired
Immunodeficiencies
 
 The
 exposed
 patient
 with
 a
 congenital
 or
 acquired
immunodeficiency
should be managed by advising the patient or his/her parents or
guardians about the exposure and the possibility that B19 infection
 may
lead to chronic anemia. The physician should consider B19 infection
 in
the differential diagnosis of chronic anemia in this group of
 patients,
especially if there is an outbreak of EI in the community.

 In several patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, the
administration of IG resulted in disappearance of viremia and
improvement in red cell indices (10). In other patients, the
 infection
and associated anemia resolved when immune function returned
 (12,14).
The role of IG in the treatment of these patients needs further
 study.
Pregnant Women  The knowledge that B19 infection during pregnancy can cause fetal
death has created concern among health-care providers, public
 health
officials, and pregnant women and their families. In managing
 exposed
pregnant women, risks should be considered in the context of other
risks to the pregnancy and the risks associated with intervention.  For women with a
documented infection, maternal serum
 œga-fetoprotein
levels and diagnostic ultrasound examinations have been used to
identify adversely affected fetuses, but the sensitivity and
specificity of these tests, their appropriate timing, and the risks
 and
benefits of their use in managing infected pregnant women have not
 yet
been determined (39,41). Interpretation of the ultrasound is
 difficult
early in pregnancy and should be supervised by a physician

 experienced
in diagnosing fetal abnormalities. Intrauterine blood transfusion
 (IBT)
has been proposed as treatment for the fetus with B19-induced
 severe
anemia. However, IBT is a high-risk, specialized procedure of
 unproven
benefit in this situation and cannot be recommended for routine
treatment of B19-related hydrops fetalis (72).
AVAILABILITY OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AT CDC  Diagnostic testing is available at only a
few sites, primarily
research laboratories; increasing the availability of diagnostic
testing is a public health priority. The Division of Viral
 Diseases,
Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC, can accept a limited number of
specimens for B19 diagnostic testing. At this time, CDC is
 accepting
specimens through state health departments from patients with TAC,
immunodeficient patients with chronic anemia, pregnant women
 exposed to
B19 or with symptoms suggestive of B19 infection, and cases of
nonimmune fetal hydrops possibly related to B19 infection, and not
accepting specimens for routine antibody testing. Physicians can
arrange testing at CDC by consulting their state health department.
PRIORITIES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH  The following areas have been identified as high

priorities for
 future
public health-related research on B19 infection:  
    Develop surveillance methods that distinguish outbreaks from
    sporadic disease.
    2.Refine estimates of infection rates following exposures in the
 home,
    the workplace, and school.
    3.Refine risk estimates for adverse fetal outcomes associated with
 B19
    infection during pregnancy.
    4.Evaluate methods to treat and prevent B19-related fetal hydrops.
    5.Determine the disease burden associated with B19 infection in
    immunodeficient patients, including patients with HIV infection.
    6.Determine the risk of infection and factors associated with
    transmission in health-care settings.
    7.Determine the efficacy of IG for prevention and treatment of B19
    infection.
    8.Determine the potential reduction in morbidity and mortality
    associated with development and use of a B19 vaccine.
