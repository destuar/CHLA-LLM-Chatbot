downloads Figure 1 Figure 2 Exposure to hepatitis viruses is a recognized occupational
risk  for  health  care  personnel  (HCP).  This  report  establishes  new  CDC  guidance  that
includes  recommendations  for  a  testing  algorithm  and  clinical  management  for  HCP
with potential occupational exposure to hepatitis C virus (HCV). Baseline testing of the
source patient and HCP should be performed as soon as possible (preferably within 48
hours) after the exposure. A source patient refers to any person receiving health care
services whose blood or other potentially infectious material is the source of the HCP’s
exposure. Two options are recommended for testing the source patient. The first option
is to test the source patient with a nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA. This option is
preferred,  particularly  if  the  source  patient  is  known  or  suspected  to  have  recent
behaviors  that  increase  risk  for  HCV  acquisition  (e.g.,  injection  drug  use  within  the
previous 4 months) or if risk cannot be reliably assessed. The second option is to test
the source patient for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), then if positive, test for
HCV  RNA.  For  HCP,  baseline  testing  for  anti-HCV  with  reflex  to  a  NAT  for  HCV  RNA  if
positive should be conducted as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hours) after the
exposure and may be simultaneous with source-patient testing. If follow-up testing is
recommended based on the source patient’s status (e.g., HCV RNA positive or anti-HCV
positive  with  unavailable  HCV  RNA  or  if  the  HCV  infection  status  is  unknown),  HCP
should  be  tested  with  a  NAT  for  HCV  RNA  at  3–6  weeks  postexposure.  If  HCV  RNA  is

negative  at  3–6  weeks  postexposure,  a  final  test  for  anti-HCV  at  4–6  months
postexposure is recommended. A source patient or HCP found to be positive for HCV
RNA  should  be  referred  to  care.  Postexposure  prophylaxis  of  hepatitis  C  is  not
recommended for HCP who have occupational exposure to blood and other body fluids.
This guidance was developed based on expert opinion (CDC. Updated U.S. Public Health
Service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV
and  recommendations  for  postexposure  prophylaxis.  MMWR  Recommend  Rep
2001;50[No. RR-11]; Supplementary Figure,https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/90288) and
reflects updated guidance from professional organizations that recommend treatment
for  acute  HCV  infection.  Health  care  providers  can  use  this  guidance  to  update  their
procedures  for  postexposure  testing  and  clinical  management  of  HCP  potentially
exposed  to  hepatitis  C  virus.  Top  Exposure  to  hepatitis  viruses  has  long  been
recognized
 as
 an
 occupational
 risk
 for
 health
 care
 personnel
 (HCP),
 and
recommendations previously were established for managing occupational exposures to
bloodborne  pathogens,  including  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV)  (1)  (Supplementary  Figure,
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/90288). HCP might be exposed to blood or other body
fluids, by injury from a used needle or from a splash of blood or body fluids into the eye
or  mouth,  while  caring  for  a  patient.  A  source  patient  refers  to  any  person  receiving
health care services whose blood or other potentially infectious material is the source of
the  HCP’s  exposure.  Although  sharps  injury  prevention  measures  have  led  to  overall
exposure  decreases  in  recent  decades,  blood  and  body  fluid  exposures,  including
sharps injuries, continue to occur (2). During 2018, a total of 34 U.S. hospitals reported
through the Exposure Prevention Information Network (EPINet) a rate of 12.6 HCP blood
and  body  fluid  exposures  per  100  average  daily  census  days  among  the  reporting
hospitals (3). Similar exposures occur in other health care settings (e.g., nursing homes,
clinics,  and  emergency  departments)  and  during  provision  of  in-home  health  care
services.

 For
 approximately
 885
 HCP
 with
 percutaneous
 exposure
 to

anti-HCV–positive  blood  (72.7%  of  exposures)  or  body  fluids  (27.3%  of  exposures)
during  2002–2015  in  the  United  States,  the  estimated  risk  for  HCV  infection  was
reported as approximately 0.2% (two of 885; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0%–0.52%)
(4). HCV RNA status of the anti-HCV positive source patients was not described. Among
458  HCP  with  mucocutaneous  exposure,  the  risk  for  HCV  infection  was  0%  (95%
CI: 0%–0.6%) (4). Recently published studies have reported similar infection risks with
percutaneous  exposure  (4–7),  although  risks  ranging  from  0%  to  10%  have  been
reported from studies published earlier (1,4,6); variability might be explained in part by
mechanism  of  injury,  sensitivity  of  the  test  used  to  detect  infection,  and  HCV  RNA
status of anti-HCV–positive source patients. Transmission risk might be higher for HCP
with  exposure  to  hollow-bore  needles  (4,8).  Challenge  studies  in  chimpanzee  animal
models  have  demonstrated  that  an  infectious  titer  (i.e.,  chimpanzee  infectious  dose)
was  required  to  transmit  infection  and  that  the  needed  inoculum  was  different  in
another animal model (i.e., human liver–chimeric mouse) (9). Data from one European
case-control  study  of  HCP  who  experienced  seroconversion  after  exposure  to  an
anti-HCV–positive  source  patient  during  1991–2002  demonstrated  that,  among  the
limited number for whom source-patient HCV RNA status was known (n = 37; 62% of
HCP who seroconverted), all source patients had been HCV RNA positive (8). This report
establishes new CDC guidance that includes recommendations for a testing algorithm
and  clinical  management  for  HCP  with  potential  occupational  exposure  to  HCV,
supplanting
 published
 recommendations
 (1)
 (Supplementary
 Figure,
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/90288).  The new  CDC guidance was developed  on  the
basis of expert opinion and reflects current understanding of the viral dynamics of early
HCV infection and recent guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases  (AASLD)  and  the  Infectious  Diseases  Society  of  America  (IDSA)  that
recommends

(https://www.hcvguidelines.org/unique-populations/acute-infection)
 (10).
 Testing

guidance for source patients is described in consideration of the increasing incidence of
acute HCV infection (11). Health care providers can use this guidance to update their
procedures  for  postexposure  testing  and  clinical  management  of  HCP  potentially
exposed to hepatitis C virus. Top CDC developed this guidance with individual input and
review  by  coauthors  from  federal  agencies  and  academic  and  private  health  care
institutions  with  subject  matter  expertise  in  occupational  health  and  viral  hepatitis
epidemiology.  The  literature  search  described  in  the  recent  review  of  HCV  incidence
after HCP exposure through 2016 (4) was updated through October 2019, resulting in
the  inclusion  of  one  additional  reference  (5).  This  guidance  was  presented  to  the
Healthcare  Infection  Control  Practices  Advisory  Committee  for  review  and  input  at  a
public meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 14, 2019. Subsequently, CDC made
minor  revisions  to  the  figures  for  clarification  to  address  the  committee’s  input.  Top
Recent  guidance  from  AASLD  and  IDSA  recommends  a  test-and-treat  strategy  for
persons  with  acute  HCV  infection  on  initial  diagnosis  without  awaiting  spontaneous
resolution (10). Although spontaneous clearance occurs in approximately 25% to 45%
of  acute  infections  (1,12,13),  delays  introduced  by  waiting  for  clearance  might  be
associated with substantial anxiety on the part of the exposed HCP, might result in lost
work time and risk for transmission depending on the HCP’s HCV RNA level (14), and
might  increase  the  possibility  of  loss  to  follow-up.  Furthermore,  emerging  data  about
treatment  of  acute  HCV  infection  with  shortened  courses  of  all-oral,  direct-acting
antiviral (DAA) regimens demonstrate potential benefit for treatment during the acute
phase  (10,15–18).  For  exposed  HCP  for  whom  follow-up  testing  is  indicated,  CDC
continues to recommend early testing for HCV RNA at 3–6 weeks after exposure. HCV
RNA  becomes  detectable  on  average  within  1  week  after  exposure;  most  infected
persons will have detectable HCV RNA within 1–2 weeks of exposure when tested with
HCV RNA detection tests approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (19,20).
However, CDC now recommends additional follow-up testing at 4–6 months for anti-HCV

with  reflex  or  follow-up  HCV  RNA  if  anti-HCV  positive  because  of  the  possibility  of
intermittent periods of aviremia during acute HCV infection. This phenomenon has been
reported previously among exposed persons, including those who progressed to chronic
infection, primarily when using older HCV RNA tests (7,21–35). Anti-HCV seroconversion
occurs,  on  average,  8–11  weeks  after  exposure  (1,20),  although  cases  of  delayed
seroconversion have been documented among persons with immunosuppression (e.g.,
immunosuppression  from  human  immunodeficiency  virus  [HIV]  infection)  (36,37).
Frequency  of  testing  during  the  follow-up  period  depends  on  the  management
objectives and plan for timing of therapy if seroconversion occurs. In the United States,
incidence of acute HCV infection is increasing, primarily related to injection drug use,
with  a  3.7-fold  increase  in  cases  reported  to  CDC  during  2010–2017  (11).  During
2014–2017, window-period infections (HCV RNA positive and anti-HCV negative) were
identified  among  5.3%  of  HCV  RNA–positive  deceased  organ  donors  who  had  risk
factors  (38).  These  window-period  data  among  a  discrete  population  with  recent
behavioral  risk  for  acquiring  HCV  indicate  the  possibility  that,  in  certain  health  care
settings,  HCP  might  be  exposed  to  source  patients  with  early  HCV  infection  before
those patients develop serologic evidence of infection or symptoms indicative of viral
hepatitis.  Postexposure  prophylaxis  (PEP)  of  hepatitis  C  is  not  recommended  for  HCP
who  have  occupational  exposure  to  blood  and  other  body  fluids  (1,10,39–41)
(Supplementary  Figure,  https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/90288).  A  2017  publication
estimated  that  0.2%  of  percutaneous  exposures  result  in  HCV  transmission  (4).  In
contrast,  older  literature  reported  that  approximately  1.8%  of  exposures  resulted  in
transmission, meaning that routine PEP use for all occupational exposures would treat
approximately  100  HCV-exposed  persons  for  every  two  persons  who  might  become
infected (40). However, with the substantially lower 2017 transmission estimate of 0.2%
for  percutaneous  exposures  and  0%  for  mucocutaneous  exposures  (4),  routine  PEP
would  need  to  be  administered  to  approximately  1,000  persons  with  percutaneous

exposures for every two persons who might become infected, with no benefit to those
with  mucocutaneous  exposures.  Treatment  efficacy  and  duration  that  would  be
required for HCV PEP has not been established (40,41). In 2019, a pilot trial of a 2-week
DAA PEP regimen was initiated for HCP who were exposed from hollow-bore needlestick
injury to an HCV RNA–positive source patient (42). Although the sample size will likely
be insufficient for statistical power to determine whether PEP prevents seroconversion,
this is the first DAA PEP study of HCV-exposed HCP. In contrast with other bloodborne
pathogens  for  which  PEP  is  recommended,  curative  DAA  therapy  is  reserved  for
treatment if HCV transmission does occur (10,15–17,40,41). Top Baseline testing of the
source  patient  should  be  performed  as  soon  as  possible  (preferably  within  48  hours)
after  the  exposure  (1,39,40)  (Figure  1)  (Box).  This  guidance  provides  two  options  for
initial source patient testing: 1) option A (preferred), to test for HCV RNA, or 2) option B,
to test for anti-HCV and then if positive, test for HCV RNA (Figure 1). All source patients
who are anti-HCV positive should be tested by a nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA
(43), preferably with a reflex test by using the same specimen if cross-contamination is
not a concern or by using a fresh aliquot of the same sample if stored correctly. If HCV
RNA tests are positive but the RNA level is less than the lower limit of quantitation of
the assay, the results are reported as <XX IU/mL (e.g., <15 IU/mL if the lower limit of
quantitation of the assay is 15 IU/mL). This means that HCV RNA was detected in the
sample but is not quantifiable and that the person from whom the sample was collected
should be considered to have current HCV infection (20). If the source patient is known
or suspected to have recent behavior risks for HCV acquisition (e.g., injection drug use
within  the  previous  4  months)  or  if  risk  cannot  be  reliably  assessed,  initial  testing
should  include  a  NAT  for  HCV  RNA.  Persons  with  recently  acquired  acute  infection
typically have detectable HCV RNA levels as early as 1–2 weeks after exposure (19,20).
Source patients determined to be positive for anti-HCV or HCV RNA should be reported
to the state or local health department (11) and referred for clinical management, as

recommended  (10).  False-positive  anti-HCV  results  are  known  to  occur  among
populations  at  low  risk  (44).  HCV  RNA  testing  is  preferred  for  source  patient  testing.
However, if anti-HCV testing is performed, a sufficient blood sample should be obtained
for simultaneous or reflex (if anti-HCV positive) HCV RNA testing. This can minimize the
need to redraw blood and reduce delays in establishing the status of the source patient.
Testing of the source patient and baseline testing of the HCP might be either concurrent
or sequential; follow-up testing of the HCP should be determined by the source patient’s
status. If the source patient is HCV RNA or anti-HCV positive with unavailable NAT or if
the HCV infection status is unknown (e.g., when the HCP sustains a percutaneous injury
from a needle in the trash), follow-up testing of the exposed HCP should be initiated.
Follow-up testing for an HCP exposed to blood or body fluids from a source patient who
tests anti-HCV positive but HCV RNA negative is not recommended because this status
can  indicate  a  previously  cleared  or  cured  infection.  However,  instances  might  occur
when  follow-up  testing  is  warranted  (e.g.,  when  specimen  integrity  concerns  exist,
including handling and storage conditions, that might have compromised test results)
(20) or if the HCP exhibits any clinical signs of HCV infection. HCP should have an initial
baseline  test  for  anti-HCV  with  testing  for  HCV  RNA  if  positive  (i.e.  either  reflex  or
follow-up NAT) as soon as possible (preferably within 48 hours) after the exposure to
rule out a pre-existing chronic infection (Box) (Figure 2). HCP testing positive for HCV
RNA at baseline should be referred to care for pre-existing current HCV infection. If HCP
are  anti-HCV  positive  and  HCV  RNA  negative  at  baseline,  this  likely  indicates  a
previously  cleared  infection;  therefore,  if  test  results  for  the  source  patient  warrant
follow-up  testing  for  HCP  in  context  of  a  current  exposure  (Figure  1),  HCP  should  be
tested for HCV RNA instead of retesting for anti-HCV, which usually will remain positive
regardless  of  current  infection  status.  HCV  PEP  with  DAA  therapy  is  not  routinely
recommended. The risk for transmission of HCV from percutaneous exposures (0.2%)
and mucocutaneous exposures (0%) is low (4) and in most situations does not justify

giving  DAAs  to  several  hundred  exposed  HCP  because  of  potential  side  effects;
furthermore, efficient duration of PEP has not been established. DAA therapy is highly
efficacious in eradicating acute and chronic infections (10,15–17,40,41); therefore, new
HCV infections should be identified early and treated, and the strategy of testing and
treating  if  transmission  occurs  is  recommended.  If  the  source  patient  is  HCV  RNA
positive or source-patient testing is not performed or not available, HCP baseline testing
should be followed by a NAT for HCV RNA at 3–6 weeks after exposure. This test also
should be performed if a source patient is anti-HCV positive and no source patient HCV
RNA testing is available. A NAT performed at 6 weeks postexposure has the advantage
of coinciding with HIV postexposure testing schedules, if recommended (39). For all HCP
for  whom  follow-up  testing  is  recommended,  a  final  test  for  anti-HCV  at  4–6  months
with  testing  for  HCV  RNA  if  positive  (i.e.  either  reflex  to  or  follow-up  NAT)  should  be
conducted  (1,10,39,40).  Testing  performed  at  6  months  postexposure  has  the
advantage of coinciding with hepatitis B virus (HBV) postexposure testing schedules, if
recommended (39,45). Exposed HCP who develop illness with symptoms indicative of
acute HCV infection at any point should be tested for HCV RNA. No further follow-up is
indicated for HCP who remain anti-HCV negative at 4–6 months. However, for those who
had  a  negative  anti-HCV  result  at  4–6  months  and  are  immunocompromised  or  have
liver  disease,  an  additional  test  for  HCV  RNA  can  be  considered  (20).  Seroconversion
from  anti-HCV  negative  to  anti-HCV  positive  with  undetectable  HCV  RNA  can  indicate
resolved  infection  or  acute  infection  during  a  period  of  aviremia  (31).  In  addition,
false-positive anti-HCV tests have been reported to occur (44). For HCP with a positive
anti-HCV result and confirmed undetectable HCV RNA after 4–6 months, a NAT for HCV
RNA  should  be  repeated  if  clinical  evidence  of  HCV  infection  is  present  (31).  Tests
should  be  repeated  if  concerns  exist  about  results  being  compromised  because  of
storage and handling errors or other issues that might affect specimen integrity (20).
HCP with detectable HCV RNA or anti-HCV seroconversion as a result of an occupational

exposure should be referred for further care and evaluation for treatment as indicated
in AASLD-IDSA guidelines (10). Because DAA therapy is highly efficacious in eradicating
acute and chronic infections (10,15–17,40,41), new HCV infections should be identified
early and treated (10). Additional recommendations are available to facilitate provision
of  occupational  infection  prevention  and  control  services  to  HCP  (46).  Top  Raymond

positive  and  HCV  RNA  negative  unless  reinfected.  Testing  performed  at  6  months

postexposure has the advantage of coinciding with hepatitis B virus (HBV) postexposure
