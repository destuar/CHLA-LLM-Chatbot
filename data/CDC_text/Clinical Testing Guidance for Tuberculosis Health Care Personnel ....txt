recommendations for TB screening, testing, and treatment of health care personnel on
May 17, 2019.    These recommendations update the health care personnel screening
and  testing  section  of  the  2005  CDC  Guidelines  for  Preventing  the  Transmission  of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health-Care Settings. U.S. health care personnel without
latent  TB  infection  should  not  undergo  routine  serial  TB  screening  or  testing  at  any
interval  after  baseline  (e.g.,  annually).  Health  care  personnel  should  have  a  timely
symptom  evaluation  and  additional  testing,  if  indicated,  after  known  exposure  to  a
person with potentially infectious TB disease, or ongoing transmission at a facility.

TB infection because they have higher completion rates.

presumed  or  confirmed.  Health  Care  Personnel  Baseline  Individual  Tuberculosis  Risk
Assessment  TB  Programs  Tuberculosis  Centers  of  Excellence  for  Training,  Education,
