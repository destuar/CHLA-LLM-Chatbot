 Summary
The  Guideline  for  Hand  Hygiene  in  Health-Care  Settings  provides  health-care  workers
(HCWs) with a review of 
data regarding handwashing and hand antisepsis in health-care settings. In addition, it
provides specific recommendations 
to  promote  improved  hand-hygiene  practices  and  reduce  transmission  of  pathogenic
microorganisms to patients and personnel 
in  health-care  settings.  This  report  reviews  studies  published  since  the  1985  CDC
guideline 
(Garner  JS,  Favero  MS.  CDC  guideline  for  handwashing  and  hospital  environmental
control, 1985. Infect Control 1986;7:231--43) and the 1995 APIC guideline (Larson EL,
APIC Guidelines Committee. APIC guideline for handwashing and hand antisepsis 
in health care settings. Am J Infect Control

hand-hygiene  practices  of  HCWs,  levels  of  adherence  of  personnel  to  recommended
handwashing practices, and factors adversely affecting adherence. New studies of the

in  vivo  efficacy  of  alcohol-based  hand  rubs  and  the  low  incidence  of  dermatitis
associated  with  their  use  are  reviewed.  Recent  studies  demonstrating  the  value  of
multidisciplinary hand-hygiene promotion programs and 
the potential role of alcohol-based hand rubs in improving hand-hygiene practices are
summarized. Recommendations 
concerning  related  issues  (e.g.,  the  use  of  surgical  hand  antiseptics,  hand  lotions  or
creams, and wearing of artificial fingernails) are also included.

 Part I. Review of the Scientific Data Regarding Hand Hygiene
Historical Perspective
For generations, handwashing with soap and water has been considered a measure of
personal hygiene 

(1). The concept of cleansing hands with an antiseptic agent probably emerged in the
early 
19th century. As early as 1822, a French 
pharmacist  demonstrated  that  solutions  containing  chlorides  of  lime  or  soda  could
eradicate the foul odors associated with human corpses and that such solutions could
be used as disinfectants and antiseptics 
(2). In a paper published in 1825, this pharmacist 
stated that physicians and other persons attending patients with contagious diseases
would benefit from moistening their hands 
with a liquid chloride solution (2).
In  1846,  Ignaz  Semmelweis  observed  that  women  whose  babies  were  delivered  by
students and physicians in the First 
Clinic at the General Hospital of Vienna consistently had a higher mortality rate than
those whose babies were delivered by 
midwives in the Second Clinic (3). He noted that physicians who went directly from the
autopsy  suite  to  the  obstetrics  ward  had  a  disagreeable  odor  on  their  hands  despite
washing their hands with soap and water upon entering the obstetrics clinic. 
He  postulated  that  the  puerperal  fever  that  affected  so  many  parturient  women  was
caused by "cadaverous particles" transmitted from the autopsy suite to the obstetrics
ward via the hands of students and physicians. Perhaps because of the 
known  deodorizing  effect  of  chlorine  compounds,  as  of  May  1847,  he  insisted  that
students and physicians clean their hands with a chlorine solution between each patient
in the clinic. The maternal mortality rate in the First Clinic subsequently 
dropped  dramatically  and  remained  low  for  years.  This  intervention  by  Semmelweis
represents the first evidence indicating that 

cleansing  heavily  contaminated  hands  with  an  antiseptic  agent  between  patient
contacts may reduce health-care--associated transmission of contagious diseases more
effectively  than  handwashing  with  plain  soap  and  water.  In  1843,  Oliver  Wendell
Holmes  concluded  independently  that  puerperal  fever  was  spread  by  the  hands  of
health 
personnel (1). Although he described measures that could be taken to limit its spread,
his recommendations had little impact on obstetric practices at the time. However, as a
result of the seminal studies by Semmelweis and Holmes, handwashing gradually 
became accepted as one of the most important measures 
for preventing transmission of pathogens in health-care facilities.
In  1961,  the  U.  S.  Public  Health  Service  produced  a  training  film  that  demonstrated
handwashing techniques 
recommended for use by health-care workers (HCWs) 
(4). At the time, recommendations directed that personnel wash their hands with 
soap and water for 1--2 minutes before and after patient contact. Rinsing hands with an
antiseptic agent was believed to be 
less effective than handwashing and was recommended only in emergencies or in areas
where sinks were unavailable.
In 1975 and 1985, formal written guidelines on handwashing practices in hospitals were
published by CDC 
(5,6).  These  guidelines  recommended  handwashing  with  non-antimicrobial  soap
between  the  majority  of  patient  contacts  and  washing  with  antimicrobial  soap  before
and after performing invasive procedures or caring for patients at high risk. Use of 
waterless  antiseptic  agents  (e.g.,  alcohol-based  solutions)  was  recommended  only  in
situations where sinks were not available.

In 1988 and 1995, guidelines for handwashing and hand antisepsis were published by
the  Association  for  Professionals  in  Infection  Control  (APIC)  (7,8).  Recommended
indications for handwashing were similar to those listed in the 
CDC  guidelines.  The  1995  APIC  guideline  included  more  detailed  discussion  of
alcohol-based  hand  rubs  and  supported  their  use  in  more  clinical  settings  than  had
been  recommended  in  earlier  guidelines.  In  1995  and  1996,  the  Healthcare  Infection
Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recommended that either antimicrobial
soap or a waterless antiseptic agent be used for cleaning hands upon leaving the rooms
of patients with multidrug-resistant pathogens (e.g., 
vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE] and methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) (9,10). These guidelines also 
provided  recommendations  for  handwashing  and  hand  antisepsis  in  other  clinical
settings, including routine patient care. Although the APIC and HICPAC guidelines have
been adopted by the majority of hospitals, adherence of HCWs to 
recommended handwashing practices has remained low 
(11,12).
Recent  developments  in  the  field  have  stimulated  a  review  of  the  scientific  data
regarding hand hygiene and the 
development  of  new  guidelines  designed  to  improve  hand-hygiene  practices  in
health-care facilities. This literature review and accompanying recommendations have
been prepared by a Hand Hygiene Task Force, comprising representatives from HICPAC,
the 
Society  for  Healthcare  Epidemiology  of  America  (SHEA),  APIC,  and  the  Infectious
Diseases Society of America (IDSA).

      
Normal Bacterial Skin Flora
To understand the objectives of different approaches to hand cleansing, a knowledge of
normal bacterial skin flora 
is essential. Normal human skin is colonized with bacteria; different areas of the body
have varied total aerobic bacterial counts (e.g., 1 x 106 colony forming units 
(CFUs)/cm2 on the scalp, 5 x 
105 CFUs/cm2 in the axilla, 4 x 104 CFUs/cm2 on the abdomen, and 1 x 104 CFUs/cm2
on the forearm) 
(13). Total bacterial counts on the hands of medical personnel have 
ranged from 3.9 x 104 to 4.6 x 
106  (14--17).  In  1938,  bacteria  recovered  from  the  hands  were  divided  into  two
categories: 
transient and resident (14). Transient flora, which colonize the superficial layers of the
skin, are more amenable to removal by routine handwashing. They are often acquired
by HCWs during direct contact with patients or contact with 
contaminated  environmental  surfaces  within  close  proximity  of  the  patient.  Transient
flora  are  the  organisms  most  frequently  associated  with  health-care--associated
infections.  Resident  flora,  which  are  attached  to  deeper  layers  of  the  skin,  are  more
resistant to removal. In addition, resident flora (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci
and  diphtheroids)  are  less  likely  to  be  associated  with  such  infections.  The  hands  of
HCWs may become persistently colonized with pathogenic flora (e.g., 
S.  aureus),  gram-negative  bacilli,  or  yeast.  Investigators  have  documented  that,

although the number of transient and resident flora varies considerably from person to
person, it is often relatively constant for any specific person 
(14,18).
Physiology of Normal Skin
The  primary  function  of  the  skin  is  to  reduce  water  loss,  provide  protection  against
abrasive action and microorganisms, 
and  act  as  a  permeability  barrier  to  the  environment.  The  basic  structure  of  skin
includes, from outer- to inner-most layer, 
the superficial region (i.e., the stratum corneum or horny layer, which is 10- to 20-µm
thick), the viable epidermis (50- to 100-µm 
thick),  the  dermis  (1-  to  2-mm  thick),  and  the  hypodermis  (1-  to  2-mm  thick).  The
barrier to  percutaneous absorption  lies within  the stratum corneum,  the thinnest and
smallest compartment of the skin. The stratum corneum contains 
the corneocytes (or horny cells), which are flat, polyhedral-shaped nonnucleated cells,
remnants of the terminally 
differentiated keratinocytes located in the viable epidermis. Corneocytes are composed
primarily  of  insoluble  bundled  keratins  surrounded  by  a  cell  envelope  stabilized  by
cross-linked proteins and covalently bound lipid. Interconnecting the corneocytes of the
stratum  corneum  are  polar  structures  (e.g.,  corneodesmosomes),  which  contribute  to
stratum corneum cohesion.
The  intercellular  region  of  the  stratum  corneum  is  composed  of  lipid  primarily

generated from the exocytosis of 
lamellar bodies during the terminal differentiation of the keratinocytes. The intercellular
lipid  is  required  for  a  competent  skin  barrier  and  forms  the  only  continuous  domain.
Directly under the stratum corneum is a stratified epidermis, which is 
composed primarily of 10--20 layers of keratinizing epithelial cells that are responsible
for the synthesis of the stratum corneum. 
This layer also contains melanocytes involved in skin pigmentation; Langerhans cells,
which are important for antigen 
presentation  and  immune  responses;  and  Merkel  cells,  whose  precise  role  in  sensory
reception  has  yet  to  be  fully  delineated.  As  keratinocytes  undergo  terminal
differentiation,  they  begin  to  flatten  out  and  assume  the  dimensions  characteristic  of
the corneocytes (i.e., their diameter changes from 10--12 µm to 20--30 µm, and their
volume increases by 10- to 20-fold). The viable epidermis does not contain a vascular
network, and the keratinocytes obtain their nutrients from below by passive diffusion
through the interstitial fluid.
The skin is a dynamic structure. Barrier function does not simply arise from the dying,
degeneration, and compaction of 
the underlying epidermis. Rather, the processes of cornification and desquamation are
intimately  linked;  synthesis  of  the  stratum  corneum  occurs  at  the  same  rate  as  loss.
Substantial  evidence  now  confirms  that  the  formation  of  the  skin  barrier  is  under
homeostatic  control,  which  is  illustrated  by  the  epidermal  response  to  barrier
perturbation by skin stripping or 
solvent  extraction.  Circumstantial  evidence  indicates  that  the  rate  of  keratinocyte
proliferation  directly  influences the integrity  of the skin  barrier.  A general  increase in
the  rate  of  proliferation  results  in  a  decrease  in  the  time  available  for  1)  uptake  of

nutrients (e.g., essential fatty acids), 2) protein and lipid synthesis, and 3) processing of
the  precursor  molecules  required  for  skin-barrier  function.  Whether  chronic  but
quantitatively smaller increases in rate of epidermal proliferation also lead to changes
in skin-barrier function remains unclear. Thus, the extent to which the decreased barrier
function caused by irritants is caused by 
an increased epidermal proliferation also is unknown.
The  current  understanding  of  the  formation  of  the  stratum  corneum  has  come  from
studies of the epidermal responses 
to  perturbation  of  the  skin  barrier.  Experimental  manipulations  that  disrupt  the  skin
barrier include 1) extraction of skin lipids with apolar solvents, 2) physical stripping of
the stratum corneum using adhesive tape, and 3) chemically induced irritation. All of
these  experimental  manipulations  lead  to  a  decreased  skin  barrier  as  determined  by
transepidermal  water  loss  (TEWL).  The  most  studied  experimental  system  is  the
treatment  of  mouse  skin  with  acetone.  This  experiment  results  in  a  marked  and
immediate increase in TEWL, and therefore a decrease in skin-barrier function. Acetone
treatment selectively 
removes  glycerolipids  and  sterols  from  the  skin,  which  indicates  that  these  lipids  are
necessary, though perhaps not sufficient in themselves, for barrier function. Detergents
act like acetone on the intercellular lipid domain. The return to normal 
barrier  function  is  biphasic:  50%--60%  of  barrier  recovery  typically  occurs  within  6
hours, but complete normalization of 
barrier function requires 5--6 days.
      
Definition of Terms

Alcohol-based hand rub. An alcohol-containing preparation designed for application to
the  hands  for  reducing  the  number  of  viable  microorganisms  on  the  hands.  In  the
United States, such preparations usually contain 60%--95% ethanol 
or isopropanol.
 Antimicrobial soap. Soap (i.e., detergent) containing an antiseptic agent.
      
Antiseptic  agent.  Antimicrobial  substances  that  are  applied  to  the  skin  to  reduce  the
number  of  microbial  flora.  Examples  include  alcohols,  chlorhexidine,  chlorine,
hexachlorophene, iodine, chloroxylenol (PCMX), quaternary 
ammonium compounds, and triclosan. 
Antiseptic  handwash.  Washing  hands  with  water  and  soap  or  other  detergents
containing an antiseptic agent.
      
Antiseptic  hand  rub.  Applying  an  antiseptic  hand-rub  product  to  all  surfaces  of  the
hands to reduce the number of microorganisms present.
      
Cumulative effect. A progressive decrease in the numbers of microorganisms recovered
after repeated applications of a test material.
      

Decontaminate  hands.  To  Reduce  bacterial  counts  on  hands  by  performing  antiseptic
hand rub or antiseptic handwash.
      
Detergent. Detergents (i.e., surfactants) are compounds that possess a cleaning action.
They are composed of 
both  hydrophilic  and  lipophilic  parts  and  can  be  divided  into  four  groups:  anionic,
cationic, amphoteric, and nonionic detergents. Although products used for handwashing
or  antiseptic  handwash  in  health-care  settings  represent  various  types  of  detergents,
the term "soap" is used to refer to such detergents in this guideline.
      
Hand antisepsis. Refers to either antiseptic handwash or antiseptic hand rub.
      
Hand hygiene. A general term that applies to either handwashing, antiseptic handwash,
antiseptic hand rub, or surgical hand antisepsis.
      
Handwashing. Washing hands with plain (i.e., non-antimicrobial) soap and water.
      
Persistent  activity.  Persistent  activity  is  defined  as  the  prolonged  or  extended
antimicrobial  activity  that  prevents  or  inhibits  the  proliferation  or  survival  of
microorganisms after application of the product. This activity may be demonstrated 

by  sampling  a  site  several  minutes  or  hours  after  application  and  demonstrating
bacterial antimicrobial effectiveness 
when  compared  with  a  baseline  level.  This  property  also  has  been  referred  to  as
"residual activity." Both substantive 
and nonsubstantive active ingredients can show a persistent effect if they substantially
lower the number of bacteria during 
the wash period. 
Plain soap. Plain soap refers to detergents that do not contain antimicrobial agents or
contain low concentrations 
of antimicrobial agents that are effective solely as preservatives. 
Substantivity. Substantivity is an attribute of certain active ingredients that adhere to
the  stratum  corneum  (i.e.,  remain  on  the  skin  after  rinsing  or  drying)  to  provide  an
inhibitory effect on the growth of bacteria remaining on the skin.
      
Surgical  hand  antisepsis.  Antiseptic  handwash  or  antiseptic  hand  rub  performed
preoperatively by surgical personnel 
to eliminate transient and reduce resident hand flora. Antiseptic detergent preparations
often have persistent 
antimicrobial activity. 
Visibly  soiled  hands.  Hands  showing  visible  dirt  or  visibly  contaminated  with
proteinaceous material, blood, or other 

body fluids (e.g., fecal material or urine). 
Waterless antiseptic agent. An antiseptic agent that does not require use of exogenous
water. After applying such an agent, the hands are rubbed together until the agent has
dried.
      
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product 
categories. The 1994 FDA Tentative Final Monograph for 
Health-Care  Antiseptic  Drug  Products  divided  products  into  three  categories  and
defined them as follows 
(19):
Patient preoperative skin 
preparation.  A  fast-acting,  broad-spectrum,  and  persistent  antiseptic-containing
preparation 
that substantially reduces the number of microorganisms on intact skin.
Antiseptic handwash or HCW 
handwash. An antiseptic-containing preparation designed for frequent use; it reduces 
the number of microorganisms on intact skin to an initial baseline level after adequate
washing, rinsing, and drying; it 
is broad-spectrum, fast-acting, and if possible, persistent.
Surgical hand scrub. An antiseptic-containing preparation that substantially reduces the
number of microorganisms 
on intact skin; it is broad-spectrum, fast-acting, and persistent.

differentiation,  they  begin  to  flatten  out  and  assume  the  dimensions  characteristic  of
the corneocytes (i.e., their diameter changes from 10--12 µm to 20--30 µm, and their
volume increases by 10- to 20-fold). The viable epidermis does not contain a vascular
network, and the keratinocytes obtain their nutrients from below by passive diffusion
through the interstitial fluid.
 The skin is a dynamic structure. Barrier function does not simply arise from the dying,
degeneration, and compaction of 
the underlying epidermis. Rather, the processes of cornification and desquamation are

intimately  linked;  synthesis  of  the  stratum  corneum  occurs  at  the  same  rate  as  loss.
Substantial  evidence  now  confirms  that  the  formation  of  the  skin  barrier  is  under
homeostatic  control,  which  is  illustrated  by  the  epidermal  response  to  barrier
perturbation by skin stripping or 
solvent  extraction.  Circumstantial  evidence  indicates  that  the  rate  of  keratinocyte
proliferation  directly  influences the integrity  of the skin  barrier.  A general  increase in
the  rate  of  proliferation  results  in  a  decrease  in  the  time  available  for  1)  uptake  of
nutrients (e.g., essential fatty acids), 2) protein and lipid synthesis, and 3) processing of
the  precursor  molecules  required  for  skin-barrier  function.  Whether  chronic  but
quantitatively smaller increases in rate of epidermal proliferation also lead to changes
in skin-barrier function remains unclear. Thus, the extent to which the decreased barrier
function caused by irritants is caused by 
an increased epidermal proliferation also is unknown.
 The  current  understanding  of  the  formation  of  the  stratum  corneum  has  come  from
studies of the epidermal responses 
to  perturbation  of  the  skin  barrier.  Experimental  manipulations  that  disrupt  the  skin
barrier include 1) extraction of skin lipids with apolar solvents, 2) physical stripping of
the stratum corneum using adhesive tape, and 3) chemically induced irritation. All of
these  experimental  manipulations  lead  to  a  decreased  skin  barrier  as  determined  by
transepidermal  water  loss  (TEWL).  The  most  studied  experimental  system  is  the
treatment  of  mouse  skin  with  acetone.  This  experiment  results  in  a  marked  and
immediate increase in TEWL, and therefore a decrease in skin-barrier function. Acetone
treatment selectively 
removes  glycerolipids  and  sterols  from  the  skin,  which  indicates  that  these  lipids  are
necessary, though perhaps not sufficient in themselves, for barrier function. Detergents
act like acetone on the intercellular lipid domain. The return to normal 

barrier  function  is  biphasic:  50%--60%  of  barrier  recovery  typically  occurs  within  6
hours, but complete normalization of 
barrier function requires 5--6 days.
      
Definition of Terms
 Alcohol-based hand rub. An alcohol-containing preparation designed for application to
the  hands  for  reducing  the  number  of  viable  microorganisms  on  the  hands.  In  the
United States, such preparations usually contain 60%--95% ethanol 
or isopropanol.
 Antimicrobial soap. Soap (i.e., detergent) containing an antiseptic agent.
      
Antiseptic  agent.  Antimicrobial  substances  that  are  applied  to  the  skin  to  reduce  the
number  of  microbial  flora.  Examples  include  alcohols,  chlorhexidine,  chlorine,
hexachlorophene, iodine, chloroxylenol (PCMX), quaternary 
ammonium compounds, and triclosan. 
Antiseptic  handwash.  Washing  hands  with  water  and  soap  or  other  detergents
containing an antiseptic agent.
      

Antiseptic  hand  rub.  Applying  an  antiseptic  hand-rub  product  to  all  surfaces  of  the
hands to reduce the number of microorganisms present.
      
Cumulative effect. A progressive decrease in the numbers of microorganisms recovered
after repeated applications of a test material.
      
Decontaminate  hands.  To  Reduce  bacterial  counts  on  hands  by  performing  antiseptic
hand rub or antiseptic handwash.
      
Detergent. Detergents (i.e., surfactants) are compounds that possess a cleaning action.
They are composed of 
both  hydrophilic  and  lipophilic  parts  and  can  be  divided  into  four  groups:  anionic,
cationic, amphoteric, and nonionic detergents. Although products used for handwashing
or  antiseptic  handwash  in  health-care  settings  represent  various  types  of  detergents,
the term "soap" is used to refer to such detergents in this guideline.
      
Hand antisepsis. Refers to either antiseptic handwash or antiseptic hand rub.
      
Hand hygiene. A general term that applies to either handwashing, antiseptic handwash,
antiseptic hand rub, or surgical hand antisepsis.
      

Handwashing. Washing hands with plain (i.e., non-antimicrobial) soap and water.
      
Persistent  activity.  Persistent  activity  is  defined  as  the  prolonged  or  extended
antimicrobial  activity  that  prevents  or  inhibits  the  proliferation  or  survival  of
microorganisms after application of the product. This activity may be demonstrated 
by  sampling  a  site  several  minutes  or  hours  after  application  and  demonstrating
bacterial antimicrobial effectiveness 
when  compared  with  a  baseline  level.  This  property  also  has  been  referred  to  as
"residual activity." Both substantive 
and nonsubstantive active ingredients can show a persistent effect if they substantially
lower the number of bacteria during 
the wash period. 
Plain soap. Plain soap refers to detergents that do not contain antimicrobial agents or
contain low concentrations 
of antimicrobial agents that are effective solely as preservatives. 
Substantivity. Substantivity is an attribute of certain active ingredients that adhere to
the  stratum  corneum  (i.e.,  remain  on  the  skin  after  rinsing  or  drying)  to  provide  an
inhibitory effect on the growth of bacteria remaining on the skin.
      
Surgical  hand  antisepsis.  Antiseptic  handwash  or  antiseptic  hand  rub  performed

preoperatively by surgical personnel 
to eliminate transient and reduce resident hand flora. Antiseptic detergent preparations
often have persistent 
antimicrobial activity. 
Visibly  soiled  hands.  Hands  showing  visible  dirt  or  visibly  contaminated  with
proteinaceous material, blood, or other 
body fluids (e.g., fecal material or urine). 
Waterless antiseptic agent. An antiseptic agent that does not require use of exogenous
water. After applying such an agent, the hands are rubbed together until the agent has
dried.
      
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product 
categories. The 1994 FDA Tentative Final Monograph for 
Health-Care  Antiseptic  Drug  Products  divided  products  into  three  categories  and
defined them as follows 
(19):
 Transmission of health-care--associated pathogens from one patient to another via the
hands of HCWs requires the 
following sequence of events:
 Health-care--associated pathogens can be recovered not only from infected or draining
wounds, but also from 
frequently colonized areas of normal, intact patient skin 
(20-- 31). The perineal or inguinal areas are usually most heavily colonized, 

but the axillae, trunk, and upper extremities (including the hands) also are frequently
colonized 
(23,25,26,28,30--32). The number of organisms 
(e.g., S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, 
Klebsiella spp., and Acinetobacter spp.) present on intact areas of the skin 
of certain patients can vary from 100 to 
106/cm2 (25,29,31,33). Persons with diabetes, patients undergoing dialysis for 
chronic renal failure, and those with chronic dermatitis are likely to have areas of intact
skin that are colonized with 
S. aureus (34--41). Because approximately 
106 skin squames containing viable microorganisms are shed daily from normal skin 
(42),  patient  gowns,  bed  linen,  bedside  furniture,  and  other  objects  in  the  patient's
immediate environment can easily become contaminated with patient flora (30,43--46).
Such contamination is particularly likely to be caused by staphylococci or enterococci,
which are resistant to dessication.
 Data  are  limited  regarding  the  types  of  patient-care  activities  that  result  in
transmission of patient flora to the hands 
of personnel (26,45--51). In the past, attempts have been made to stratify patient-care
activities into those most likely to 
cause hand contamination (52), but such stratification schemes were never validated
by quantifying the level of 
bacterial  contamination  that  occurred.  Nurses  can  contaminate  their  hands  with
100--1,000 CFUs of 
Klebsiella spp. during 
"clean" activities (e.g., lifting a patient; taking a patient's pulse, blood pressure, or oral
temperature; or touching a patient's 

hand,  shoulder,  or  groin)  (48).  Similarly,  in  another  study,  hands  were  cultured  of
nurses who touched the groins of patients heavily colonized with P. mirabilis 
(25); 10--600 CFUs/mL of this organism were recovered from glove juice samples from
the 
nurses'  hands.  Recently,  other  researchers  studied  contamination  of  HCWs'  hands
during activities that involved direct patient-contact wound care, intravascular catheter
care, 
respiratory-tract care, and the handling of patient secretions 
(51).  Agar  fingertip  impression  plates  were  used  to  culture  bacteria;  the  number  of
bacteria  recovered  from  fingertips  ranged  from  0  to  300  CFUs.  Data  from  this  study
indicated  that  direct  patient  contact  and  respiratory-tract  care  were  most  likely  to
contaminate the fingers 
of caregivers. Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 15% of isolates and 
S. aureus for 11%. Duration of patient-care activity 
was strongly associated with the intensity of bacterial contamination of HCWs' hands.
 HCWs can contaminate their hands with gram-negative bacilli, 
S. aureus, enterococci, or Clostridium 
difficile  by  performing  "clean  procedures"  or  touching  intact  areas  of  the  skin  of
hospitalized patients 
(26,45,46,53). Furthermore, personnel 
caring for infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have acquired RSV by
performing certain activities (e.g., 
feeding infants, changing diapers, and playing with infants) 
(49). Personnel who had contact only with surfaces contaminated with 
the  infants'  secretions  also  acquired  RSV  by  contaminating  their  hands  with  RSV  and

inoculating their oral or 
conjunctival mucosa. Other studies also have documented that HCWs may contaminate
their hands (or gloves) merely by touching inanimate objects in patient rooms 
(46,53--56). None of the studies concerning hand contamination of hospital 
personnel were designed to determine if the contamination resulted in transmission of
pathogens to susceptible patients.  Other studies have documented  contamination of
HCWs' hands with potential health-care--associated pathogens, but 
did  not  relate  their  findings  to  the  specific  type  of  preceding  patient  contact
(15,17,57--62). For example, before glove use 
was common among HCWs, 15% of nurses working in an isolation unit carried a median
of 1 x 104 CFUs of S. aureus on their hands 
(61).  Of  nurses  working  in  a  general  hospital,  29%  had  S.  aureus  on  their  hands
(median count: 3,800 CFUs), 
whereas 78% of those working in a hospital for dermatology patients had the organism
on their hands (median count: 14.3 x 106 CFUs). Similarly, 17%--30% of nurses carried
gram-negative bacilli on their hands (median counts: 3,400--38,000 CFUs). One study
found that S. aureus could be recovered from the hands of 21% of intensive-care--unit
personnel and that 21% of physician and 5% of nurse carriers had >1,000 CFUs of the
organism on their hands 
(59).  Another  study  found  lower  levels  of  colonization  on  the  hands  of  personnel
working in a neurosurgery unit, with an average of 3 CFUs of S. aureus and 11 CFUs of
gram-negative bacilli 
(16). Serial cultures revealed that 100% of HCWs carried gram-negative bacilli at least

once, and 
64% carried S. aureus at least once.
      
Models of Hand Transmission
 Several investigators have studied transmission of infectious agents by using different
experimental models. In one 
study,  nurses  were  asked  to  touch  the  groins  of  patients  heavily  colonized  with
gram-negative bacilli for 15 seconds --- as though 
they were taking a femoral pulse (25). Nurses then cleaned their hands by washing with
plain soap and water or by using an alcohol hand rinse. After cleaning their hands, they
touched a piece of urinary catheter material with their fingers, and the catheter 
segment was cultured. The study revealed that touching intact areas of moist skin of
the patient transferred enough 
organisms  to  the  nurses'  hands  to  result  in  subsequent  transmission  to  catheter
material,  despite  handwashing  with  plain  soap  and  water.   The  transmission  of
organisms from artificially contaminated "donor" fabrics to clean "recipient" fabrics via
hand  contact  also  has  been  studied.  Results  indicated  that  the  number  of  organisms
transmitted was greater if the donor fabric or the 
hands were wet upon contact (63). Overall, only 0.06% of the organisms obtained from
the contaminated donor fabric were transferred to recipient fabric via hand contact. 
Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 

and  Serratia  spp.  were  also  transferred  in  greater  numbers  than  was  Escherichia  coli
from contaminated fabric to clean fabric after hand contact 
(64).  Organisms  are  transferred  to  various  types  of  surfaces  in  much  larger  numbers
(i.e., >104) from wet hands than from hands that are thoroughly dried 
(65).
      
Relation of Hand Hygiene and Acquisition of Health-Care--Associated Pathogens
 Hand antisepsis reduces the incidence of health-care--associated infections 
(66,67). An intervention trial using 
historical  controls  demonstrated  in  1847  that  the  mortality  rate  among  mothers  who
delivered  in  the  First  Obstetrics  Clinic  at  the  General  Hospital  of  Vienna  was
substantially  lower  when  hospital  staff  cleaned  their  hands  with  an  antiseptic  agent
than when they washed their hands with plain soap and water 
(3).
 In  the  1960s,  a  prospective,  controlled  trial  sponsored  by  the  National  Institutes  of
Health and the Office of the 
Surgeon General demonstrated that infants cared for by nurses who did not wash their
hands  after  handling  an  index  infant  colonized  with  S.  aureus  acquired  the  organism
more  often  and  more  rapidly  than  did  infants  cared  for  by  nurses  who  used
hexachlorophene to clean their hands between infant contacts 
(68). This trial provided evidence that, when compared with 
no  handwashing,  washing  hands  with  an  antiseptic  agent  between  patient  contacts
reduces transmission of health-care--associated pathogens.

 Trials have studied the effects of handwashing with plain soap and water versus some
form of hand antisepsis on health-care--associated infection rates 
(69,70).
 Health-care--associated
 infection
 rates
 were
 lower
 when
 antiseptic
handwashing 
was  performed  by  personnel  (69).  In  another  study,  antiseptic  handwashing  was
associated  with  lower  health-care--associated  infection  rates  in  certain  intensive-care
units, but not in others (70).  Health-care--associated infection rates were lower after
antiseptic  handwashing  using  a  chlorhexidine-containing  detergent  compared  with
handwashing with plain soap or use of an alcohol-based hand rinse 
(71).  However,  because  only  a  minimal  amount  of  the  alcohol  rinse  was  used  during
periods  when  the  combination  regimen  also  was  in  use  and  because  adherence  to
policies  was  higher  when  chlorhexidine  was  available,  determining  which  factor  (i.e.,
the hand-hygiene regimen or 
differences  in  adherence)  accounted  for  the  lower  infection  rates  was  difficult.
Investigators  have  determined  also  that  health-care--associated  acquisition  of  MRSA
was reduced when the antimicrobial soap used for hygienic handwashing was changed
(72,73).
 Increased  handwashing  frequency  among  hospital  staff  has  been  associated  with
decreased transmission of 
Klebsiella spp. among patients (48); these studies, however, did not quantitate the level
of  handwashing  among  personnel.  In  a  recent  study,  the  acquisition  of  various
health-care--associated  pathogens  was  reduced  when  hand  antisepsis  was  performed
more 
frequently by hospital personnel (74); both this study and another 
(75) documented that the prevalence of 
health-care--associated
 infections
 decreased
 as
 adherence
 to
 recommended

hand-hygiene measures improved.
 Outbreak  investigations  have  indicated  an  association  between  infections  and
understaffing  or  overcrowding;  the  association  was  consistently  linked  with  poor
adherence to hand hygiene. During an outbreak investigation of risk factors for central
venous catheter-associated bloodstream infections 
(76), after adjustment for confounding factors, the patient-to-nurse 
ratio  remained  an  independent  risk  factor  for  bloodstream  infection,  indicating  that
nursing staff reduction below a 
critical  threshold  may  have  contributed  to  this  outbreak  by  jeopardizing  adequate
catheter  care.  The  understaffing  of  nurses  can  facilitate  the  spread  of  MRSA  in
intensive-care settings 
(77)  through  relaxed  attention  to  basic  control  measures  (e.g.,  hand  hygiene).  In  an
outbreak of Enterobacter 
cloacae in a neonatal intensive-care unit 
(78), the daily number of hospitalized children was above the maximum capacity of the
unit,  resulting  in  an  available  space  per  child  below  current  recommendations.  In
parallel, the number of staff members on duty was substantially less than the number
necessitated by 
the  workload,  which  also  resulted  in  relaxed  attention  to  basic  infection-control
measures. Adherence to hand-hygiene 
practices before device contact was only 25% during the workload peak, but increased
to  70%  after  the  end  of  the  understaffing  and  overcrowding  period.  Surveillance
documented that being hospitalized during this period was associated with a 

fourfold 
increased  risk  of  acquiring  a  health-care--associated  infection.  This  study  not  only
demonstrates the association 
between  workload  and  infections,  but  it  also  highlights  the  intermediate  cause  of
antimicrobial spread: poor adherence to hand-hygiene policies.
      
Methods Used To Evaluate the Efficacy of Hand-Hygiene Products
 
Current Methods
 Investigators use different methods to study the in 
vivo efficacy of handwashing, antiseptic handwash, and surgical 
hand  antisepsis  protocols.  Differences  among  the  various  studies  include  1)  whether
hands  are  purposely  contaminated  with  bacteria  before  use  of  test  agents,  2)  the
method used to contaminate fingers or hands, 3) the volume of hand-hygiene product 
applied to the hands, 4) the time the product is in contact with the skin, 5) the method
used to recover bacteria from the skin after the test solution has been used, and 6) the
method of expressing the efficacy of the product (i.e., either percent reduction 
in bacteria recovered from the skin or log reduction of bacteria released from the skin).
Despite these differences, the majority 
of studies can be placed into one of two major categories: studies focusing on products
to remove transient flora and 
studies involving products that are used to remove resident flora from the hands. The
majority of studies of products for 

removing transient flora from the hands of HCWs involve artificial contamination of the
volunteer's skin with a defined inoculum of a test organism before the volunteer uses a
plain soap, an antimicrobial soap, or a waterless antiseptic agent. In contrast, products
tested  for  the  preoperative  cleansing  of  surgeons'  hands  (which  must  comply  with
surgical hand-antisepsis protocols) are tested for their ability to remove resident flora
from without artificially contaminating the volunteers' hands.
 In  the  United  States,  antiseptic  handwash  products  intended  for  use  by  HCWs  are
regulated by FDA's Division of Over-the-Counter Drug Products (OTC). Requirements for
in  vitro  and  in  vivo  testing  of  HCW  handwash  products  and  surgical  hand  scrubs  are
outlined in the FDA Tentative Final Monograph for Healthcare Antiseptic Drug Products
(TFM) 
(19).  Products  intended  for  use  as  HCW  handwashes  are  evaluated  by  using  a
standardized method 
(19). Tests are performed in accordance with use directions for the test material. Before
baseline  bacterial  sampling  and  before  each  wash  with  the  test  material,  5  mL  of  a
standardized suspension of Serratia 
marcescens are applied to the hands and then rubbed over the surfaces of the hands. 
A specified volume of the test material is dispensed into the hands and is spread over
the hands and lower one third of 
the  forearms.  A  small  amount  of  tap  water  is  added  to  the  hands,  and  hands  are
completely  lathered  for  a  specified  time,  covering  all  surfaces  of  the  hands  and  the
lower third of the forearms. Volunteers then rinse hands and forearms under 
40ºC tap water for 30 seconds. Ten washes with the test formulation are required. After
the first, third, seventh, and tenth washes, rubber gloves or polyethylene bags used for
sampling are placed on the right and left hands, and 75 mL of sampling solution is 

added to each glove; gloves are secured above the wrist. All surfaces of the hand are
massaged for 1 minute, and samples are obtained aseptically for quantitative culture.
No  neutralizer  of  the  antimicrobial  is  routinely  added  to  the  sampling  solution,  but  if
dilution  of  the  antimicrobial  in  the  sampling  fluid  does  not  result  in  demonstrable
neutralization, a neutralizer specific for the test formulation is added to the sampling
solution. For waterless formulations, a similar procedure is used. TFM criteria 
for efficacy are as follows: a 2-log10 reduction of the indicator organism on each hand
within 5 minutes after the first use, and a 3-log10 reduction of the indicator organism
on each hand within 5 minutes after the tenth use 
(19).
 Products intended for use as surgical hand scrubs have been evaluated also by using a
standardized method 
(19).  Volunteers  clean  under  fingernails  with  a  nail  stick  and  clip  their  fingernails.  All
jewelry is removed from hands and arms. Hands and two thirds of forearms are rinsed
with tap water 
(38ºC--42ºC) for 30 seconds, and then they are washed with a 
non-antimicrobial soap for 30 seconds and are rinsed for 30 seconds under tap water.
Baseline  microbial  hand  counts  can  then  be  determined.  Next,  a  surgical  scrub  is
performed with the test formulation using directions provided by the manufacturer. If
no  instructions  are  provided  with  the  formulation,  two  5-minute  scrubs  of  hands  and
forearms  followed  by  rinsing  are  performed.  Reduction  from  baseline  microbial  hand
counts  is  determined  in  a  series  of  11  scrubs  conducted  during  5  days.  Hands  are
sampled at 1 minute, 3 hours, and 6 hours after the first scrubs on day 1, day 2, and
day 5. After washing, volunteers wear rubber gloves; 

75 mL of sampling solution are then added to one glove, and all surfaces of the hands
are massaged for 1 minute. Samples 
are then taken aseptically and cultured quantitatively. The other glove remains on the
other hand for 6 hours and is sampled in 
the same manner. TFM requires that formulations reduce the number of bacteria 1 
log10 on each hand within 1 minute of 
product  application  and  that  the  bacterial  cell  count  on  each  hand  does  not
subsequently exceed baseline within 6 hours on day 1; 
the formulation must produce a 2-log10 reduction in microbial flora on each hand within
1 minute of product application by the 
end of the second day of enumeration and a 
3-log10 reduction of microbial flora on each hand within 1 minute of product use 
by the end of the fifth day when compared with the established baseline 
(19).
 The  method  most  widely  used  in  Europe  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  hand-hygiene
agents is European Standard 
1500--1997 (EN 1500---Chemical disinfectants and antiseptics. Hygienic hand-rub test
method and requirements) (79). This method requires 12--15 test volunteers and an 18-
to 24-hour growth of broth culture of 
E. coli K12. Hands are washed with a soft soap, dried, and then immersed halfway to
the metacarpals in the broth culture for 5 seconds. Hands are removed from the broth
culture,  excess  fluid  is  drained  off,  and  hands  are  dried  in  the  air  for  3  minutes.
Bacterial recovery for the initial value 
is obtained by kneading the fingertips of each hand separately for 60 seconds in 10 mL
of tryptic soy broth (TSB) 

without neutralizers. The hands are removed from the broth and disinfected with 3 mL
of the hand-rub agent for 30 seconds in a 
set design. The same operation is repeated with total disinfection time not exceeding
60 seconds. Both hands are rinsed in running water for 5 seconds and water is drained
off.  Fingertips  of  each  hand  are  kneaded  separately  in  10  mL  of  TSB  with  added
neutralizers. These broths are used to obtain the final value. 
Log10 dilutions of recovery medium are prepared and plated 
out.  Within  3  hours,  the  same  volunteers  are  tested  with  the  reference  disinfectant
(60% 2-propanol [isopropanol]) and the test product. Colony counts are performed after
24 and 48 hours of incubation at 
36ºC. The average colony count of both left 
and  right  hand  is  used  for  evaluation.  The  log-reduction  factor  is  calculated  and
compared  with  the  initial  and  final  values.  The  reduction  factor  of  the  test  product
should be superior or the same as the reference alcohol-based rub for acceptance. If a
difference  exists,  then  the  results  are  analyzed  statistically  using  the  Wilcoxon  test.
Products that have log 
reductions substantially less than that observed with the reference alcohol-based hand
rub (i.e., approximately 4 log10 reduction) are classified as not meeting the standard.
 Because of different standards for efficacy, criteria cited in FDA TFM and the European
EN 1500 document for 
establishing alcohol-based hand rubs vary 
(1,19,79).  Alcohol-based  hand  rubs  that  meet  TFM  criteria  for  efficacy  may  not
necessarily 
meet  the  EN  1500  criteria  for  efficacy  (80).  In  addition,  scientific  studies  have  not

established  the  extent  to  which  counts  of  bacteria  or  other  microorganisms  on  the
hands  need  to  be  reduced  to  minimize  transmission  of  pathogens  in  health-care
facilities (1,8); whether bacterial counts on the hands must be reduced by 1 
log10 (90% reduction), 2 
log10 (99%), 3 log10 (99.9%), or 
4 log10 (99.99%) is unknown. Several other methods also have been used to measure
the efficacy of antiseptic agents 
against various viral pathogens (81--83).
 
Shortcomings of Traditional Methodologies
 Accepted  methods  of  evaluating  hand-hygiene  products  intended  for  use  by  HCWs
require that test volunteers wash 
their hands with a plain or antimicrobial soap for 30 seconds or 1 minute, despite the
observation in the majority of studies that 
the average duration of handwashing by hospital personnel is <15 seconds 
(52,84--89). A limited number of investigators 
have used 15-second handwashing or hygienic hand-wash protocols 
(90--94). Therefore, almost no data exist regarding the 
efficacy of plain or antimicrobial soaps under conditions in which they are actually used
by HCWs. Similarly, certain 
accepted methods for evaluating waterless antiseptic agents for use as antiseptic hand
rubs require that 3 mL of alcohol be rubbed into the hands for 30 seconds, followed by
a repeat application for the same duration. This type of protocol also does not 
reflect  actual  usage  patterns  among  HCWs.  Furthermore,  volunteers  used  in
evaluations of products are usually surrogates for HCWs, and their hand flora may not

reflect  flora  found  on  the  hands  of  personnel  working  in  health-care  settings.  Further
studies  should  be  conducted  among  practicing  HCWs  using  standardized  protocols  to
obtain more realistic views of 
microbial colonization and risk of bacterial transfer and cross-transmission 
(51).
      
Review of Preparations Used for Hand Hygiene
 
Plain (Non-Antimicrobial) Soap
 Soaps are detergent-based products that contain esterified fatty acids and sodium or
potassium hydroxide. They are 
available  in  various  forms  including  bar  soap,  tissue,  leaflet,  and  liquid  preparations.
Their cleaning activity can be attributed to their detergent properties, which result in
removal of dirt, soil, and various organic substances from the hands. Plain soaps 
have minimal, if any, antimicrobial activity. However, handwashing with plain soap can
remove loosely adherent transient flora. For example, handwashing with plain soap and
water for 15 seconds reduces bacterial counts on the skin by 0.6--1.1 log10, whereas
washing for 30 seconds reduces counts by 1.8--2.8 
log10 (1). However, in several studies, handwashing with plain soap 
failed to remove pathogens from the hands of hospital personnel 
(25,45). Handwashing with plain soap can result 
in paradoxical increases in bacterial counts on the skin (92,95--97). Non-antimicrobial

soaps may be associated with considerable skin irritation and dryness 
(92,96,98),  although  adding  emollients  to  soap  preparations  may  reduce  their
propensity to 
cause irritation. Occasionally, plain soaps have become contaminated, which may lead
to colonization of hands of personnel with gram-negative bacilli (99).
 
Alcohols
 The  majority  of  alcohol-based  hand  antiseptics  contain  either  isopropanol,  ethanol,
n-propanol, or a combination of two of these products. Although n-propanol has been
used in alcohol-based hand rubs in parts of Europe for many years, it is not listed in
TFM  as  an  approved  active  agent  for  HCW  handwashes  or  surgical  hand-scrub
preparations in the United States. 
The  majority  of  studies  of  alcohols  have  evaluated  individual  alcohols  in  varying
concentrations. Other studies have focused on combinations of two alcohols or alcohol
solutions containing limited amounts of hexachlorophene, quaternary 
ammonium compounds, povidone-iodine, triclosan, or chlorhexidine gluconate 
(61,93,100--119).
 The  antimicrobial  activity  of  alcohols  can  be  attributed  to  their  ability  to  denature
proteins 
(120).  Alcohol  solutions  containing  60%--95%  alcohol  are  most  effective,  and  higher
concentrations are less potent (120--122) because proteins are not denatured easily in
the absence of water 
(120). The alcohol content of solutions may be expressed as percent by weight 
(w/w), which is not affected by temperature or other variables, or as percent by volume
(vol/vol), which can be affected 

by temperature, specific gravity, and reaction concentration (123). For example, 70%
alcohol  by  weight  is  equivalent  to  76.8%  by  volume  if  prepared  at  15ºC,  or  80.5%  if
prepared at 
25ºC  (123).  Alcohol  concentrations  in  antiseptic  hand  rubs  are  often  expressed  as
percent by volume (19).
 Alcohols  have  excellent  in  vitro  germicidal  activity  against  gram-positive  and
gram-negative vegetative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant pathogens (e.g., MRSA
and VRE), 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and various fungi 
(120--122,124--129). Certain enveloped (lipophilic) viruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus,
human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], influenza 
virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and vaccinia virus) are susceptible to alcohols when
tested in vitro 
(120,130,131) (Table 1). Hepatitis B virus is an enveloped virus that is somewhat less
susceptible but is killed by 60%--70% alcohol; hepatitis C virus also is likely killed by
this percentage of alcohol 
(132). In a porcine tissue carrier model used to study antiseptic activity, 
70%  ethanol  and  70%  isopropanol  were  found  to  reduce  titers  of  an  enveloped
bacteriophage more effectively than an 
antimicrobial soap containing 4% chlorhexidine gluconate 
(133). Despite its effectiveness against these organisms, 
alcohols  have  very  poor  activity  against  bacterial  spores,  protozoan  oocysts,  and
certain nonenveloped (nonlipophilic) viruses.  Numerous studies have documented the
in 
vivo antimicrobial activity of alcohols. Alcohols effectively reduce 

bacterial counts on the hands 
(14,121,125,134).  Typically,  log  reductions  of  the  release  of  test  bacteria  from
artificially 
contaminated hands average 3.5 log10 after a 30-second application and 4.0--5.0 
log10 after a 1-minute application 
(1).  In  1994,  the  FDA  TFM  classified  ethanol  60%--95%  as  a  Category  I  agent  (i.e.,
generally safe and effective for use in antiseptic handwash 
or  HCW  hand-wash  products)  (19).  Although  TFM  placed  isopropanol  70%--91.3%  in
category IIIE (i.e., insufficient data 
to classify as effective), 60% isopropanol has subsequently been adopted in Europe as
the reference standard against 
which alcohol-based hand-rub products are compared 
(79). Alcohols are rapidly germicidal when applied to the skin, but they 
have no appreciable persistent (i.e., residual) activity. However, regrowth of bacteria on
the skin occurs slowly after use of 
alcohol-based  hand  antiseptics,  presumably  because  of  the  sublethal  effect  alcohols
have on some of the skin bacteria 
(135,136). Addition of chlorhexidine, quaternary ammonium compounds, octenidine, or
triclosan to alcohol-based solutions can result 
in persistent activity (1).
 Alcohols, when used in concentrations present in alcohol-based hand rubs, also have in
vivo activity against 
several  nonenveloped  viruses  (Table  2).  For  example,  70%  isopropanol  and  70%
ethanol are more effective than medicated soap 
or nonmedicated soap in reducing rotavirus titers on fingerpads 
(137,138). A more recent study using the same test 

methods evaluated a commercially available product containing 60% ethanol and found
that the product reduced the infectivity titers 
of three nonenveloped viruses (i.e., rotavirus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus) by >3 logs 
(81).  Other  nonenveloped  viruses  such  as  hepatitis  A  and  enteroviruses  (e.g.,
poliovirus) may require 70%--80% alcohol to be reliably inactivated (82,139). However,
both 70% ethanol and a 62% ethanol foam product with emollients reduced hepatitis A
virus titers on whole hands 
or  fingertips  more  than  nonmedicated  soap;  both  were  equally  as  effective  as
antimicrobial soap containing 4% 
chlorhexidine gluconate in reducing reduced viral counts on hands 
(140). In the same study, both 70% ethanol and the 62% ethanol 
foam  product  demonstrated  greater  virucidal  activity  against  poliovirus  than  either
non-antimicrobial soap or a 4% 
chlorhexidine 
gluconate-containing soap (140). However, depending on the alcohol concentration, the
amount of time that hands 
are  exposed  to  the  alcohol,  and  viral  variant,  alcohol  may  not  be  effective  against
hepatitis A and other nonlipophilic viruses. The inactivation of nonenveloped viruses is
influenced  by  temperature,  disinfectant-virus  volume  ratio,  and  protein  load  (141).
Ethanol  has  greater  activity  against  viruses  than  isopropanol.  Further  in  vitro  and  in
vivo studies of both 
alcohol-based  formulations  and  antimicrobial  soaps  are  warranted  to  establish  the
minimal  level  of  virucidal  activity  that  is  required  to  interrupt  direct  contact
transmission of viruses in health-care settings.
 Alcohols are not appropriate for use when hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with

proteinaceous materials. 
However,  when  relatively  small  amounts  of  proteinaceous  material  (e.g.,  blood)  are
present, ethanol and isopropanol may reduce 
viable bacterial counts on hands more than plain soap or antimicrobial soap 
(142).
 Alcohol can prevent the transfer of health-care--associated pathogens 
(25,63,64). In one study, gram-negative bacilli 
were transferred from a colonized patient's skin to a piece of catheter material via the
hands of nurses in only 17% of 
experiments after antiseptic hand rub with an alcohol-based hand rinse 
(25). In contrast, transfer of the organisms occurred in 92% 
of experiments after handwashing with plain soap and water. This experimental model
indicates that when the hands of HCWs are heavily contaminated, an antiseptic hand
rub using an alcohol-based rinse can prevent pathogen transmission more effectively
than can handwashing with plain soap and water.
 Alcohol-based  products  are  more  effective  for  standard  handwashing  or  hand
antisepsis by HCWs than soap or 
antimicrobial soaps (Table 3) 
(25,53,61,93,106--112,119,143--152).  In  all  but  two  of  the  trials  that  compared
alcohol-based solutions 
with antimicrobial soaps or detergents, alcohol reduced bacterial counts on hands more
than washing hands with soaps 
or  detergents  containing  hexachlorophene,  povidone-iodine,  4%  chlorhexidine,  or
triclosan.  In  studies  examining  antimicrobial-resistant  organisms,  alcohol-based
products  reduced  the  number  of  multidrug-resistant  pathogens  recovered  from  the

hands of HCWs more effectively than did handwashing with soap and water 
(153--155).
 Alcohols are effective for preoperative cleaning of the hands of surgical personnel 
(1,101,104,113--119,135,143,147,156--159) (Tables 4 and 
      5). In multiple studies, bacterial counts on the hands were determined immediately
after using the product and again 1--3 hours later; the delayed testing was performed
to determine if regrowth of bacteria on the hands is 
inhibited during operative procedures. Alcohol-based solutions were more effective than
washing hands with plain soap in all studies, and they reduced bacterial counts on the
hands  more  than  antimicrobial  soaps  or  detergents  in  the  majority  of  experiments
(101,104,113--119,135,143,147,157--159
). In addition, the majority of alcohol-based preparations were more effective 
than povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine.
 The  efficacy  of  alcohol-based  hand-hygiene  products  is  affected  by  several  factors,
including the type of alcohol 
used, concentration of alcohol, contact time, volume of alcohol used, and whether the
hands are wet when the alcohol is applied. Applying small volumes (i.e., 0.2--0.5 mL) of
alcohol  to  the  hands  is  not  more  effective  than  washing  hands  with  plain  soap  and
water  (63,64).  One  study  documented  that  1  mL  of  alcohol  was  substantially  less
effective than 3 mL 
(91). The ideal volume of product to apply to the hands is not known and may vary for
different  formulations.  However,  if  hands  feel  dry  after  rubbing  hands  together  for
10--15 seconds, an insufficient volume of product likely was applied. Because 
alcohol-impregnated towelettes contain a limited amount of alcohol, their effectiveness

is comparable to that of soap and 
water (63,160,161).
 Alcohol-based  hand  rubs  intended  for  use  in  hospitals  are  available  as  low  viscosity
rinses,  gels,  and  foams.  Limited  data  are  available  regarding  the  relative  efficacy  of
various formulations. One field trial demonstrated that an ethanol gel was slightly more
effective than a comparable ethanol solution at reducing bacterial counts on the hands
of HCWs 
(162). However, a more recent study indicated that rinses reduced bacterial counts on
the hands more than the gels tested 
(80). Further studies are warranted to determine the relative efficacy of alcohol-based
rinses and gels in reducing transmission of health-care--associated pathogens.
 Frequent use of alcohol-based formulations for hand antisepsis can cause drying of the
skin unless emollients, humectants, 
or  other  skin-conditioning  agents  are  added  to  the  formulations.  The  drying  effect  of
alcohol  can  be  reduced  or  eliminated  by  adding  1%--3%  glycerol  or  other
skin-conditioning agents 
(90,93,100,101,106,135,143,163,164). Moreover, in several 
recent  prospective  trials,  alcohol-based  rinses  or  gels  containing  emollients  caused
substantially less skin irritation and dryness than the soaps or antimicrobial detergents
tested 
(96,98,165,166). These studies, which were conducted in clinical settings, 
used various subjective and objective methods for assessing skin irritation and dryness.
Further studies are warranted to 
establish whether products with different formulations yield similar results.
 Even  well-tolerated  alcohol  hand  rubs  containing  emollients  may  cause  a  transient
stinging sensation at the site of 

any  broken  skin  (e.g.,  cuts  and  abrasions).  Alcohol-based  hand-rub  preparations  with
strong fragrances may be poorly tolerated 
by  HCWs  with  respiratory  allergies.  Allergic  contact  dermatitis  or  contact  urticaria
syndrome caused by hypersensitivity 
to alcohol or to various additives present in certain alcohol hand rubs occurs only rarely
(167,168).
 Alcohols are flammable. Flash points of alcohol-based hand rubs range from 
21ºC to 24ºC, depending on the type 
and concentration of alcohol present (169). As a result, alcohol-based hand rubs should
be stored away from high temperatures 
or  flames  in  accordance  with  National  Fire  Protection  Agency  recommendations.  In
Europe, where alcohol-based hand rubs 
have  been  used  extensively  for  years,  the  incidence  of  fires  associated  with  such
products has been low 
(169).  One  recent  U.S.  report  described  a  flash  fire  that  occurred  as  a  result  of  an
unusual series of events, which included an HCW applying an alcohol gel to her hands,
immediately  removing  a  polyester  isolation  gown,  and  then  touching  a  metal  door
before the alcohol 
had evaporated (170). Removing the polyester gown created a substantial amount of
static electricity that generated an 
audible static spark when the HCW touched the metal door, igniting the unevaporated
alcohol on her hands 
(170).  This  incident  emphasizes  the  need  to  rub  hands  together  after  application  of
alcohol-based  products  until  all  the  alcohol  has  evaporated.   Because  alcohols  are
volatile, containers should be designed to minimize evaporation. Contamination of 

alcohol-based solutions has seldom been reported. One report documented a cluster of
pseudoinfections caused by contamination of 
ethyl alcohol by Bacillus cereus spores 
(171).
 
Chlorhexidine
 Chlorhexidine  gluconate,  a  cationic  bisbiguanide,  was  developed  in  England  in  the
early 1950s and was introduced into 
the United States in the 1970s (8,172). Chlorhexidine base is only minimally soluble in
water, but the digluconate form is 
water-soluble.  The  antimicrobial  activity  of  chlorhexidine  is  likely  attributable  to
attachment to, and subsequent disruption 
of, cytoplasmic membranes, resulting in precipitation of cellular contents 
(1,8). Chlorhexidine's immediate antimicrobial 
activity  occurs  more  slowly  than  that  of  alcohols.  Chlorhexidine  has  good  activity
against gram-positive bacteria, somewhat less activity against gram-negative bacteria
and fungi, and only minimal activity against tubercle bacilli 
(1,8,172). Chlorhexidine is not sporicidal 
(1,172).  It  has  in  vitro  activity  against  enveloped  viruses  (e.g.,  herpes  simplex  virus,
HIV,  cytomegalovirus,  influenza,  and  RSV)  but  substantially  less  activity  against
nonenveloped viruses (e.g., rotavirus, adenovirus, and 
enteroviruses)  (130,131,173).  The  antimicrobial  activity  of  chlorhexidine  is  only
minimally  affected  by  the  presence  of  organic  material,  including  blood.  Because
chlorhexidine  is  a  cationic  molecule,  its  activity  can  be  reduced  by  natural  soaps,
various  inorganic  anions,  nonionic  surfactants,  and  hand  creams  containing  anionic
emulsifying agents 

(8,172,174).  Chlorhexidine  gluconate  has  been  incorporated  into  a  number  of
hand-hygiene  preparations.  Aqueous  or  detergent  formulations  containing  0.5%  or
0.75% chlorhexidine are more effective than plain soap, but they are less effective than
antiseptic detergent 
preparations containing 4% chlorhexidine gluconate 
(135,175). Preparations with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate are slightly less 
effective than those containing 4% chlorhexidine 
(176).
 Chlorhexidine has substantial residual activity 
(106,114--116,118,135,146,175). Addition of low concentrations 
(0.5%--1.0%) of chlorhexidine to alcohol-based preparations results in greater residual
activity than alcohol alone 
(116,135). When used as recommended, chlorhexidine has a good safety record 
(172). Minimal, if any, absorption of the compound 
occurs through the skin. Care must be taken to avoid contact with the eyes when using
preparations with 
>1%  chlorhexidine,  because  the  agent  can  cause  conjunctivitis  and  severe  corneal
damage.  Ototoxicity  precludes  its  use  in  surgery  involving  the  inner  or  middle  ear.
Direct contact with brain tissue and the meninges should be avoided. The frequency of
skin irritation 
is  concentration-dependent,  with  products  containing  4%  most  likely  to  cause
dermatitis when used frequently for 
antiseptic  handwashing  (177);  allergic  reactions  to  chlorhexidine  gluconate  are
uncommon 
(118,172).  Occasional  outbreaks  of  nosocomial  infections  have  been  traced  to
contaminated solutions of chlorhexidine 

(178--181).
 
Chloroxylenol
 Chloroxylenol, also known as parachlorometaxylenol (PCMX), is a halogen-substituted
phenolic compound that has 
been used as a preservative in cosmetics and other products and as an active agent in
antimicrobial soaps. It was developed in 
Europe in the late 1920s and has been used in the United States since the 1950s 
(182).
 The  antimicrobial  activity  of  PCMX  likely  is  attributable  to  inactivation  of  bacterial
enzymes and alteration of cell walls 
(1).  It  has  good  in  vitro  activity  against  gram-positive  organisms  and  fair  activity
against gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, and 
certain viruses (1,7,182). PCMX is less active against 
P. aeruginosa, but addition of ethylene-diaminetetraacetic acid 
(EDTA) increases its activity against Pseudomonas 
spp. and other pathogens. 
 A limited number of articles focusing on the efficacy of PCMX-containing preparations
intended for use by HCWs 
have been published in the last 25 years, and the results of studies have sometimes
been contradictory. For example, in studies 
in which antiseptics were applied to abdominal skin, PCMX had the weakest immediate
and residual activity of any of the 
agents  studied  (183).  However,  when  30-second  handwashes  were  performed  using

0.6%  PCMX,  2%  chlorhexidine  gluconate,  or  0.3%  triclosan,  the  immediate  effect  of
PCMX was similar to that of the other agents. When used 18 times per day for 
5 consecutive days, PCMX had less cumulative activity than did chlorhexidine gluconate
(184).  When  PCMX  was  used  as  a  surgical  scrub,  one  report  indicated  that  3%  PCMX
had immediate and residual activity comparable to 4% chlorhexidine gluconate (185),
whereas  two  other  studies  demonstrated  that  the  immediate  and  residual  activity  of
PCMX was inferior to both chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone-iodine 
(176,186). The disparity between published studies may be associated 
with  the  various  concentrations  of  PCMX  included  in  the  preparations  evaluated  and
with other aspects of the formulations 
tested, including the presence or absence of EDTA 
(7,182). PCMX is not as rapidly active as chlorhexidine gluconate or 
iodophors,  and  its  residual  activity  is  less  pronounced  than  that  observed  with
chlorhexidine gluconate 
(7,182). In 1994, FDA TFM tentatively classified PCMX as a Category IIISE active agent
(i.e.,  insufficient  data  are  available  to  classify  this  agent  as  safe  and  effective)  (19).
Further evaluation of this agent by the FDA is ongoing.
 The  antimicrobial  activity  of  PCMX  is  minimally  affected  by  the  presence  of  organic
matter, but it is neutralized 
by nonionic surfactants. PCMX, which is absorbed through the skin 
(7,182), is usually well-tolerated, and allergic 
reactions associated with its use are uncommon. PCMX is available in concentrations of
0.3%--3.75%. In-use contamination of 
a PCMX-containing preparation has been reported 

(187).
 
Hexachlorophene
 Hexachlorophene is a bisphenol composed of two phenolic groups and three chlorine
moieties. In the 1950s and 
early 1960s, emulsions containing 3% hexachlorophene were widely used for hygienic
handwashing, as surgical scrubs, and 
for  routine  bathing  of  infants  in  hospital  nurseries.  The  antimicrobial  activity  of
hexachlorophene results from its ability 
to  inactivate  essential  enzyme  systems  in  microorganisms.  Hexachlorophene  is
bacteriostatic, with good activity against 
S.  aureus  and  relatively  weak  activity  against  gram-negative  bacteria,  fungi,  and
mycobacteria 
(7).
 Studies of hexachlorophene as a hygienic handwash and surgical scrub demonstrated
only modest efficacy after a 
single handwash (53,143,188). Hexachlorophene has residual activity for several hours
after use and gradually reduces 
bacterial counts on hands after multiple uses (i.e., it has a cumulative effect) 
(1,101,188,189).  With  repeated  use  of  3%  hexachlorophene  preparations,  the  drug  is
absorbed  through  the  skin.  Infants  bathed  with  hexachlorophene  and  personnel
regularly using a 3% hexachlorophene preparation for handwashing have blood levels
of 0.1--0.6 ppm hexachlorophene 
(190).  In  the  early  1970s,  certain  infants  bathed  with  hexachlorophene  developed
neurotoxicity (vacuolar degeneration) (191). As a result, in 1972, the FDA warned that
hexachlorophene should no longer be used routinely for bathing infants. However, after

routine  use  of  hexachlorophene  for  bathing  infants  in  nurseries  was  discontinued,
investigators noted that the incidence 
of  health-care--associated  S.  aureus  infections  in  hospital  nurseries  increased
substantially 
(192,193).  In  several  instances,  the  frequency  of  infections  decreased  when
hexachlorophene bathing of infants was reinstituted. However, current guidelines still
recommend against the routine bathing of neonates with hexachlorophene because of
its potential neurotoxic effects 
(194).  The  agent  is  classified  by  FDA  TFM  as  not  generally  recognized  as  safe  and
effective for use as an antiseptic handwash (19). Hexachlorophene should not be used
to  bathe  patients  with  burns  or  extensive  areas  of  susceptible,  sensitive  skin.  Soaps
containing 3% hexachlorophene are available by prescription only 
(7).
 
Iodine and Iodophors
 Iodine  has  been  recognized  as  an  effective  antiseptic  since  the  1800s.  However,
because iodine often causes irritation 
and discoloring of skin, iodophors have largely replaced iodine as the active ingredient
in antiseptics.
 Iodine molecules rapidly penetrate the cell wall of microorganisms and inactivate cells
by forming complexes with 
amino  acids  and  unsaturated  fatty  acids,  resulting  in  impaired  protein  synthesis  and
alteration of cell membranes 
(195). Iodophors are composed of elemental iodine, iodide or triiodide, and a polymer
carrier (i.e., the complexing agent) of high molecular weight. The amount of molecular

iodine present (so-called "free" iodine) determines the level of antimicrobial activity of 
iodophors. "Available" iodine refers to the total amount of iodine that can be titrated
with sodium thiosulfate 
(196). Typical 10% 
povidone-iodine  formulations  contain  1%  available  iodine  and  yield  free  iodine
concentrations of 1 ppm 
(196).  Combining  iodine  with  various  polymers  increases  the  solubility  of  iodine,
promotes sustained release of iodine, and reduces 
skin  irritation.  The  most  common  polymers  incorporated  into  iodophors  are  polyvinyl
pyrrolidone (i.e., povidone) and 
ethoxylated nonionic detergents (i.e., poloxamers) 
(195,196). The antimicrobial activity of iodophors also can be affected by 
pH,  temperature,  exposure  time,  concentration  of  total  available  iodine,  and  the
amount and type of organic and 
inorganic compounds present (e.g., alcohols and detergents).
 Iodine and iodophors have bactericidal activity against gram-positive, gram-negative,
and certain spore-forming 
bacteria (e.g., clostridia and Bacillus spp.) and are active against mycobacteria, viruses,
and fungi (8,195,197--200). However, in concentrations used in antiseptics, iodophors
are not usually sporicidal (201). In vivo studies have demonstrated 
that  iodophors  reduce  the  number  of  viable  organisms  that  are  recovered  from  the
hands of personnel 
(113,145,148,152,155).  Povidone-iodine  5%--10%  has  been  tentatively  classified  by
FDA TFM as a Category I agent (i.e., a safe and effective agent for use as an antiseptic
handwash and an HCW handwash) 

(19). The extent to which iodophors exhibit persistent 
antimicrobial activity after they have been washed off the skin is unclear. In one study,
persistent  activity  was  noted  for  6  hours  (176);  however,  several  other  studies
demonstrated persistent activity for only 30--60 minutes after washing hands with an
iodophor (61,117,202). In studies in which bacterial counts were obtained after gloves
were worn for 1--4 hours after washing, iodophors have demonstrated poor persistent
activity 
(1,104,115,189,203--208). The in vivo antimicrobial activity 
of iodophors is substantially reduced in the presence of organic substances (e.g., blood
or sputum) 
(8).
 The  majority  of  iodophor  preparations  used  for  hand  hygiene  contain  7.5%--10%
povidone-iodine. Formulations 
with  lower  concentrations  also  have  good  antimicrobial  activity  because  dilution  can
increase free iodine concentrations 
(209). However, as the amount of free iodine increases, the degree of skin irritation also
may increase 
(209). Iodophors cause less skin irritation and fewer allergic reactions than iodine, but
more irritant contact dermatitis than other antiseptics commonly used for hand hygiene
(92). Occasionally, iodophor antiseptics have become contaminated with gram-negative
bacilli as a result 
of  poor  manufacturing  processes  and  have  caused  outbreaks  or  pseudo-outbreaks  of
infection 
(196).

 
Quaternary Ammonium Compounds
 Quaternary ammonium compounds are composed of a nitrogen atom linked directly to
four alkyl groups, which may 
vary  in  their  structure  and  complexity  (210).  Of  this  large  group  of  compounds,  alkyl
benzalkonium chlorides are the most 
widely  used  as  antiseptics.  Other  compounds  that  have  been  used  as  antiseptics
include benzethonium chloride, cetrimide, 
and cetylpyridium chloride (1). The antimicrobial activity of these compounds was first
studied in the early 1900s, and 
a quaternary ammonium compound for preoperative cleaning of surgeons' hands was
used as early as 1935 
(210).  The  antimicrobial  activity  of  this  group  of  compounds  likely  is  attributable  to
adsorption  to  the  cytoplasmic  membrane,  with  subsequent  leakage  of  low  molecular
weight cytoplasmic constituents 
(210).
 Quaternary  ammonium  compounds  are  primarily  bacteriostatic  and  fungistatic,
although they are microbicidal 
against certain organisms at high concentrations 
(1); they are more active against gram-positive bacteria than against 
gram-negative bacilli. Quaternary ammonium compounds have relatively weak activity
against mycobacteria and fungi and have 
greater  activity  against  lipophilic  viruses.  Their  antimicrobial  activity  is  adversely
affected by the presence of organic material, and they are not compatible with anionic
detergents 
(1,210). In 1994, FDA TFM tentatively classified benzalkonium chloride 
and benzethonium chloride as Category IIISE active agents (i.e., insufficient data exists

to classify them as safe and effective for 
use as an antiseptic handwash) (19). Further evaluation of these agents by FDA is in
progress.
 Quaternary  ammonium  compounds  are  usually  well  tolerated.  However,  because  of
weak activity against 
gram-negative  bacteria,  benzalkonium  chloride  is  prone  to  contamination  by  these
organisms. Several outbreaks of infection 
or
 pseudoinfection
 have
 been
 traced
 to
 quaternary
 ammonium
 compounds
contaminated with gram-negative bacilli 
(211--213). For this reason, in the United States, these compounds have been seldom
used  for  hand  antisepsis  during  the  last  15--20  years.  However,  newer  handwashing
products containing benzalkonium chloride or benzethonium chloride have recently 
been  introduced  for  use  by  HCWs.  A  recent  study  of  surgical  intensive-care  unit
personnel found that cleaning hands with antimicrobial wipes containing a quaternary
ammonium  compound  was  about  as  effective  as  using  plain  soap  and  water  for
handwashing;  both  were  less  effective  than  decontaminating  hands  with  an
alcohol-based hand rub 
(214).  One  laboratory-based  study  reported  that  an  alcohol-free  hand-rub  product
containing  a  quaternary  ammonium  compound  was  efficacious  in  reducing  microbial
counts on the hands of volunteers 
(215). Further studies of such products are needed to determine if 
newer formulations are effective in health-care settings.
 
Triclosan
 Triclosan  (chemical  name:  2,4,4'  --trichloro-2'-hydroxy-diphenyl  ether)  is  a  nonionic,

colorless substance that was 
developed in the 1960s. It has been incorporated into soaps for use by HCWs and the
public and into other consumer 
products.  Concentrations  of  0.2%--2%  have  antimicrobial  activity.  Triclosan  enters
bacterial cells and affects the cytoplasmic membrane and synthesis of RNA, fatty acids,
and proteins 
(216). Recent studies indicate this agent's antibacterial activity is 
attributable to binding to the active site of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase 
(217,218).
 Triclosan has a broad range of antimicrobial activity, but it is often bacteriostatic 
(1).  Minimum  inhibitory  concentrations  (MICs)  range  from  0.1  to  10  ug/mL,  whereas
minimum  bactericidal  concentrations  are  25--500  ug/mL.  Triclosan's  activity  against
gram-positive organisms (including MRSA) is greater than against gram-negative bacilli,
particularly 
P. aeruginosa (1,216). The agent possesses reasonable activity against mycobacterial
and 
Candida spp., but it has limited activity 
against filamentous fungi. Triclosan (0.1%) reduces bacterial counts on hands by 2.8 
log10 after a 1-minute hygienic handwash 
(1). In several studies, log reductions have been lower after triclosan is used than when
chlorhexidine, iodophors, or 
alcohol-based products are applied 
(1,61,149,184,219). In 1994, FDA TFM tentatively classified triclosan 
<1.0% as a Category IIISE active agent (i.e., insufficient data exist to classify this agent
as safe and effective for use as an antiseptic handwash) (19). Further evaluation of this

agent by the FDA is underway. Like chlorhexidine, triclosan has persistent activity on
the skin. Its activity 
in  hand-care  products  is  affected  by  pH,  the  presence  of  surfactants,  emollients,  or
humectants and by the ionic nature of 
the  particular  formulation  (1,216).  Triclosan's  activity  is  not  substantially  affected  by
organic  matter,  but  it  can  be  inhibited  by  sequestration  of  the  agent  in  micelle
structures formed by surfactants present in certain formulations. The majority 
of formulations containing <2% triclosan are well-tolerated and seldom cause allergic
reactions. Certain reports indicate 
that  providing  hospital  personnel  with  a  triclosan-containing  preparation  for  hand
antisepsis has led to decreased MRSA 
infections (72,73). Triclosan's lack of potent activity against gram-negative bacilli has
resulted in occasional reports of contamination (220).
 
Other Agents
 Approximately 150 years after puerperal-fever--related maternal mortality rates were
demonstrated by Semmelweis to be reduced by use of a hypochlorite hand rinse, the
efficacy  of  rubbing  hands  for  30  seconds  with  an  aqueous  hypochlorite  solution  was
studied once again 
(221). The solution was demonstrated to be no more effective than distilled water. 
The  regimen  used  by  Semmelweis,  which  called  for  rubbing  hands  with  a  4%  [w/w]
hypochlorite solution until the hands were slippery (approximately 5 minutes), has been
revisited by other researchers 
(222). This more current study indicated that 
the regimen was 30 times more effective than a 1-minute rub using 60% isopropanol.

However, because hypochlorite solutions 
are often irritating to the skin when used repeatedly and have a strong odor, they are
seldom used for hand hygiene.
 Certain  other  agents  are  being  evaluated  by  FDA  for  use  in  health-care-related
antiseptics 
(19). However, the efficacy of these agents has not been evaluated adequately for use
in  handwashing  preparations  intended  for  use  by  HCWs.  Further  evaluation  of  these
agents is warranted. Products that use different concentrations of traditional antiseptics
(e.g., low concentrations 
of  iodophor)  or  contain  novel  compounds  with  antiseptic  properties  are  likely  to  be
introduced for use by HCWs. For 
example,  preliminary  studies  have  demonstrated  that  adding  silver-containing
polymers  to  an  ethanol  carrier  (i.e.,  Surfacine®)  results  in  a  preparation  that  has
persistent antimicrobial activity on animal and human skin 
(223). New compounds with good in vitro activity must be tested in vivo to determine
their abilities to reduce transient and resident skin flora on the hands of HCWs. 
      
Activity of Antiseptic Agents Against Spore-Forming Bacteria
 The widespread prevalence of health-care--associated diarrhea caused by 
Clostridium difficile and the recent occurrence in 
the United States of human Bacillus 
anthracis infections associated with contaminated items sent through the postal system
has  raised  concern  regarding  the  activity  of  antiseptic  agents  against  spore-forming

bacteria. None of the agents 
(including  alcohols,  chlorhexidine,  hexachlorophene,  iodophors,  PCMX,  and  triclosan)
used in antiseptic handwash or antiseptic 
hand-rub preparations are reliably sporicidal against 
Clostridium spp. or Bacillus spp. 
(120,172,224,225).  Washing  hands  with  non-antimicrobial  or  antimicrobial  soap  and
water may help to physically remove spores from the surface of contaminated hands.
HCWs should be encouraged  to wear gloves when caring for patients with 
C. difficile-associated diarrhea 
(226). After gloves are removed, hands should be washed with a non-antimicrobial or
an antimicrobial soap and water or disinfected with 
an alcohol-based hand rub. During outbreaks of C. 
difficile-related infections, washing hands with a non-antimicrobial 
or 
antimicrobial soap and water after removing gloves is prudent. HCWs with suspected or
documented exposure to 
B. anthracis-contaminated items also should be encouraged to wash their hands with a
non-antimicrobial or antimicrobial soap and water. 
      
Reduced Susceptibility of Bacteria to Antiseptics
 Reduced  susceptibility  of  bacteria  to  antiseptic  agents  can  either  be  an  intrinsic
characteristic of a species or can be 

an acquired trait (227). Several reports have described strains of bacteria that appear
to have acquired reduced susceptibility 
(when defined by MICs established in vitro) to certain antiseptics (e.g., chlorhexidine,
quaternary ammonium compounds, 
and  triclosan)  (227--230).  However,  because  the  antiseptic  concentrations  that  are
actually  used  by  HCWs  are  often  substantially  higher  than  the  MICs  of  strains  with
reduced  antiseptic  susceptibility,  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  in  vitro  findings  is
questionable. For example, certain strains of MRSA have chlorhexidine and quaternary
ammonium 
compound MICs that are several-fold higher than 
methicillin-susceptible  strains,  and  certain  strains  of  S.  aureus  have  elevated  MICs  to
triclosan 
(227,228). However, such strains were readily inhibited by the concentrations of these
antiseptics that are actually used by practicing HCWs (227,228). The description of a
triclosan-resistant  bacterial  enzyme  has  raised  the  question  of  whether  resistance  to
this agent may develop more readily than to other antiseptic agents 
(218). In addition, exposing 
Pseudomonas strains containing the MexAB-OprM efflux system to triclosan may select
for mutants that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones 
(230).  Further  studies  are  needed  to  determine  whether  reduced  susceptibility  to
antiseptic 
agents is of epidemiologic significance and whether resistance to antiseptics has any
influence on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains (227).
      

Surgical Hand Antisepsis
 Since  the  late  1800s,  when  Lister  promoted  the  application  of  carbolic  acid  to  the
hands of surgeons before 
procedures, preoperative cleansing of hands and forearms with an antiseptic agent has
been an accepted practice 
(231). Although no randomized, controlled trials have been conducted to indicate that
surgical-site  infection  rates  are  substantially  lower  when  preoperative  scrubbing  is
performed with an antiseptic agent rather than a non-antimicrobial soap, certain other 
factors provide a strong rationale for this practice. Bacteria on the hands of surgeons
can cause wound infections if introduced into 
the operative field during surgery (232); rapid multiplication of bacteria occurs under
surgical gloves if hands are washed with 
a  non-antimicrobial  soap.  However,  bacterial  growth  is  slowed  after  preoperative
scrubbing with an antiseptic agent 
(14,233). Reducing resident skin flora on the hands of the surgical team for the duration
of  a  procedure  reduces  the  risk  of  bacteria  being  released  into  the  surgical  field  if
gloves become punctured or torn during surgery 
(1,156,169). Finally, at least one outbreak 
of  surgical-site  infections  occurred  when  surgeons  who  normally  used  an  antiseptic
surgical scrub preparation began using a non-antimicrobial product (234).
 Antiseptic preparations intended for use as surgical hand scrubs are evaluated for their
ability to reduce the number 
of  bacteria  released  from  hands  at  different  times,  including  1)  immediately  after

scrubbing, 2) after wearing surgical gloves for 
6  hours  (i.e.,  persistent  activity),  and  3)  after  multiple  applications  over  5  days  (i.e.,
cumulative activity). Immediate 
and persistent activity are considered the most important in determining the efficacy of
the product. U.S. guidelines 
recommend  that  agents  used  for  surgical  hand  scrubs  should  substantially  reduce
microorganisms on intact skin, contain a 
nonirritating antimicrobial preparation, have broad-spectrum activity, and be fast-acting
and persistent 
(19,235).
 Studies  have  demonstrated  that  formulations  containing  60%--95%  alcohol  alone  or
50%--95% when combined 
with  limited  amounts  of  a  quaternary  ammonium  compound,  hexachlorophene,  or
chlorhexidine gluconate, lower bacterial 
counts on the skin immediately postscrub more effectively than do other agents (Table
4). The next most active agents (in order 
of decreasing activity) are chlorhexidine gluconate, iodophors, triclosan, and plain soap 
(104,119,186,188, 203,204,206,208,236). Because studies of PCMX as a surgical scrub
have  yielded  contradictory  results,  further  studies  are  needed  to  establish  how  the
efficacy of this compound compares with the other agents 
(176,185,186).
 Although alcohols are not considered to have persistent antimicrobial activity, bacteria
appear to reproduce slowly on 
the  hands  after  a  surgical  scrub  with  alcohol,  and  bacterial  counts  on  hands  after
wearing gloves for 1--3 hours seldom 

exceed baseline (i.e., prescrub) values (1). However, a recent study demonstrated that
a  formulation  containing  61%  ethanol  alone  did  not  achieve  adequate  persistent
activity at 6 hours postscrub 
(237). Alcohol-based preparations containing 0.5% or 
1% 
chlorhexidine gluconate have persistent activity that, in certain studies, has equaled or
exceeded that of 
chlorhexidine gluconate-containing detergents 
(1,118,135,237).*
 Persistent  antimicrobial  activity  of  detergent-based  surgical  scrub  formulations  is
greatest for those containing 2% or 
4% chlorhexidine gluconate, followed by hexachlorophene, triclosan, and iodophors 
(1,102,113--115,159,189,203, 
204,206--208,236). Because hexachlorophene is absorbed into the blood after repeated
use,  it  is  seldom  used  as  a  surgical  scrub.   Surgical  staff  have  been  traditionally
required to scrub their hands for 10 minutes preoperatively, which frequently leads 
to  skin  damage.  Several  studies  have  demonstrated  that  scrubbing  for  5  minutes
reduces  bacterial  counts  as  effectively  as  a  10-minute  scrub  (117,238,239).  In  other
studies,  scrubbing  for  2  or  3  minutes  reduced  bacterial  counts  to  acceptable   levels
(156,205,207,240,241).
 Studies have indicated that a two-stage surgical scrub using an antiseptic detergent,
followed by application of an alcohol-containing preparation, is effective. For example,
an  initial  1-  or  2-minute  scrub  with  4%  chlorhexidine  gluconate  or  povidone-iodine
followed by application of an alcohol-based product has been as effective as a 5-minute
scrub with 

an antiseptic detergent (114,242).
 Surgical hand-antisepsis protocols have required personnel to scrub with a brush. But
this practice can damage the skin 
of personnel and result in increased shedding of bacteria from the hands 
(95,243). Scrubbing with a disposable sponge 
or combination sponge-brush has reduced bacterial counts on the hands as effectively
as scrubbing with a brush 
(244--246).  However,  several  studies  indicate  that  neither  a  brush  nor  a  sponge  is
necessary to reduce bacterial counts on the hands of surgical personnel to acceptable
levels, especially when 
alcohol-based products are used (102,117,159,165,233,237, 
247,248). Several of these studies performed cultures immediately or at 45--60 minutes
postscrub (102,117, 233,247,248), whereas in other studies, cultures were obtained 3
and 6 hours postscrub (159,237). For example, a recent laboratory-based study 
using  volunteers  demonstrated  that  brushless  application  of  a  preparation  containing
1%  chlorhexidine  gluconate  plus  61%  ethanol  yielded  lower  bacterial  counts  on  the
hands of participants than using a sponge/brush to apply a 4% chlorhexidine-containing
detergent preparation 
(237).
Relative Efficacy of Plain Soap, Antiseptic Soap/Detergent, and Alcohols
 Comparing studies related to the in vivo efficacy of plain soap, antimicrobial soaps, and
alcohol-based hand rubs 

is problematic, because certain studies express efficacy as the percentage reduction in
bacterial counts achieved, whereas 
others  give  log10  reductions  in  counts  achieved.  However,  summarizing  the  relative
efficacy of agents tested in each study can 
provide  an  overview  of  the  in  vivo  activity  of  various  formulations  intended  for
handwashing, hygienic handwash, antiseptic hand 
rub, or surgical hand antisepsis (Tables 2--4).
      
Irritant Contact Dermatitis Resulting from Hand-Hygiene Measures
 
Frequency and Pathophysiology of Irritant Contact Dermatitis
 In  certain  surveys,  approximately  25%  of  nurses  report  symptoms  or  signs  of
dermatitis involving their hands, and as 
many as 85% give a history of having skin problems 
(249). Frequent and repeated use of hand-hygiene products, particularly 
soaps  and  other  detergents,  is  a  primary  cause  of  chronic  irritant  contact  dermatitis
among HCWs 
(250). The potential of detergents to cause skin irritation can vary considerably and can
be ameliorated by the addition of emollients and humectants. Irritation associated with
antimicrobial soaps may be caused by the antimicrobial agent or by other ingredients of
the 
formulation.  Affected  persons  often  complain  of  a  feeling  of  dryness  or  burning;  skin
that feels "rough;" and erythema, scaling, or 
fissures.  Detergents  damage  the  skin  by  causing  denaturation  of  stratum  corneum
proteins, changes in intercellular lipids 

(either  depletion  or  reorganization  of  lipid  moieties),  decreased  corneocyte  cohesion,
and decreased stratum corneum 
water-binding capacity (250,251). Damage to the skin also changes skin flora, resulting
in  more  frequent  colonization  by  staphylococci  and  gram-negative  bacilli  (17,90).
Although alcohols are among the safest antiseptics available, they can cause dryness
and 
irritation  of  the  skin  (1,252).  Ethanol  is  usually  less  irritating  than  n-propanol  or
isopropanol 
(252).
 Irritant contact dermatitis is more commonly reported with iodophors 
(92). Other antiseptic agents that can cause 
irritant  contact  dermatitis  (in  order  of  decreasing  frequency)  include  chlorhexidine,
PCMX,  triclosan,  and  alcohol-based  products.  Skin  that  is  damaged  by  repeated
exposure  to  detergents  may  be  more  susceptible  to  irritation  by  alcohol-based
preparations  (253).  The  irritancy  potential  of  commercially  prepared  hand-hygiene
products, which is often determined by measuring 
transepidermal water loss, may be available from the manufacturer. Other factors that
can contribute to dermatitis 
associated  with  frequent  handwashing  include  using  hot  water  for  handwashing,  low
relative humidity (most common in winter 
months), failure to use supplementary hand lotion or cream, and the quality of paper
towels 
(254,255). Shear forces associated with wearing or removing gloves and allergy to latex

proteins may also contribute to dermatitis of the hands of HCWs.
 
Allergic Contact Dermatitis Associated with Hand-Hygiene Products
 Allergic reactions to products applied to the skin (i.e., contact allergies) may present as
delayed type reactions (i.e., 
allergic  contact  dermatitis)  or  less  commonly  as  immediate  reactions  (i.e.,  contact
urticaria).  The  most  common  causes  of  contact  allergies  are  fragrances  and
preservatives; emulsifiers are less common causes 
(256--259). Liquid soaps, hand lotions or 
creams,  and  "udder  ointments"  may  contain  ingredients  that  cause  contact  allergies
among HCWs 
(257,258).
 Allergic  reactions  to  antiseptic  agents,  including  quaternary  ammonium  compounds,
iodine or iodophors, 
chlorhexidine, triclosan, PCMX, and alcohols have been reported 
(118,167,172,256,260--265). Allergic contact dermatitis associated 
with  alcohol-based  hand  rubs  is  uncommon.  Surveillance  at  a  large  hospital  in
Switzerland, where a commercial alcohol hand 
rub has been used for >10 years, failed to identify a single case of documented allergy
to the product 
(169).  In  late  2001,  a  Freedom  of  Information  Request  for  data  in  the  FDA's  Adverse
Event  Reporting  System  regarding  adverse  reactions  to  popular  alcohol  hand  rubs  in
the  United  States  yielded  only  one  reported  case  of  an  erythematous  rash  reaction
attributed to such 
a  product  (John  M.  Boyce,  M.D.,  Hospital  of  St.  Raphael,  New  Haven,  Connecticut,

personal communication, 
2001). However, with increasing use of such products by HCWs, true allergic reactions
to such products likely will be encountered.
 Allergic  reactions  to  alcohol-based  products  may  represent  true  allergy  to  alcohol,
allergy to an impurity or 
aldehyde metabolite, or allergy to another constituent of the product 
(167).  Allergic  contact  dermatitis  or  immediate  contact  urticarial  reactions  may  be
caused by ethanol or isopropanol (167). Allergic reactions can be caused by compounds
that may be 
present as inactive ingredients in alcohol-based hand rubs, including fragrances, benzyl
alcohol,  stearyl  or  isostearyl  alcohol,  phenoxyethanol,  myristyl  alcohol,  propylene
glycol, parabens, and benzalkonium chloride (167,256,266--270).
      
Proposed Methods for Reducing Adverse Effects of Agents
 Potential  strategies  for  minimizing  hand-hygiene--related  irritant  contact  dermatitis
among HCWs include reducing 
the  frequency  of  exposure  to  irritating  agents  (particularly  anionic  detergents),
replacing products with high irritation 
potential  with  preparations  that  cause  less  damage  to  the  skin,  educating  personnel
regarding  the  risks  of  irritant  contact  dermatitis,  and  providing  caregivers  with
moisturizing skin-care products or barrier creams 
(96,98,251,271--273). Reducing the frequency 
of  exposure  of  HCWs  to  hand-hygiene  products  would  prove  difficult  and  is  not
desirable because of the low levels of 

adherence  to  hand-hygiene  policies  in  the  majority  of  institutions.  Although  hospitals
have  provided  personnel  with  non-antimicrobial  soaps  in  hopes  of  minimizing
dermatitis, frequent use of such products may cause greater skin damage, dryness, and
irritation than antiseptic preparations 
(92,96,98). One strategy for reducing the exposure of personnel to irritating soaps and 
detergents  is  to  promote  the  use  of  alcohol-based  hand  rubs  containing  various
emollients.  Several  recent  prospective,  randomized  trials  have  demonstrated  that
alcohol-based  hand  rubs  containing  emollients  were  better  tolerated  by  HCWs  than
washing 
hands with non-antimicrobial soaps or antimicrobial soaps 
(96,98,166). Routinely washing hands with soap and water 
immediately  after  using  an  alcohol  hand  rub  may  lead  to  dermatitis.  Therefore,
personnel should be reminded that it is neither 
necessary  nor  recommended  to  routinely  wash  hands  after  each  application  of  an
alcohol hand rub.
 Hand lotions and creams often contain humectants and various fats and oils that can
increase skin hydration and 
replace altered or depleted skin lipids that contribute to the barrier function of normal
skin 
(251,271).  Several  controlled  trials have demonstrated  that regular use (e.g.,  twice a
day) of such products can help prevent and treat irritant contact dermatitis caused by
hand-hygiene  products  (272,273).  In  one  study,  frequent  and  scheduled  use  of  an
oil-containing lotion improved 
skin condition, and thus led to a 50% increase in handwashing frequency among HCWs
(273). Reports from these 

studies  emphasize  the  need  to  educate  personnel  regarding  the  value  of  regular,
frequent use of hand-care products.  Recently, barrier creams have been marketed for
the prevention of hand-hygiene--related irritant contact dermatitis. 
Such products are absorbed to the superficial layers of the epidermis and are designed
to form a protective layer that is not removed by standard handwashing. Two recent
randomized, controlled trials that evaluated the skin condition of 
caregivers demonstrated that barrier creams did not yield better results than did the
control lotion or vehicle used 
(272,273).  As  a  result,  whether  barrier  creams  are  effective  in  preventing  irritant
contact dermatitis among HCWs remains unknown. 
 In  addition  to  evaluating  the  efficacy  and  acceptability  of  hand-care  products,
product-selection committees should 
inquire about the potential deleterious effects that oil-containing products may have on
the integrity of rubber gloves and on 
the efficacy of antiseptic agents used in the facility 
(8,236).
Factors To Consider When Selecting Hand-Hygiene Products
 When  evaluating  hand-hygiene  products  for  potential  use  in  health-care  facilities,
administrators or 
product-selection committees must consider factors that can affect the overall efficacy
of  such  products,  including  the  relative  efficacy  of  antiseptic  agents  against  various
pathogens (Appendix) and acceptance of hand-hygiene products by personnel 

(274,275).  Soap  products  that  are  not  well-accepted  by  HCWs  can  be  a  deterrent  to
frequent handwashing 
(276).  Characteristics  of  a  product  (either  soap  or  alcohol-based  hand  rub)  that  can
affect  acceptance  by  personnel  include  its  smell,  consistency  (i.e.,  "feel"),  and  color
(92,277,278). For soaps, ease of lathering also may affect user preference. 
 Because HCWs may wash their hands from a limited number of times per shift to as
many as 30 times per shift, 
the tendency of products to cause skin irritation and dryness is a substantial factor that
influences acceptance, and ultimate 
usage  (61,98,274,275,277,279).  For  example,  concern  regarding  the  drying  effects  of
alcohol  was  a  primary  cause  of  poor  acceptance  of  alcohol-based  hand-hygiene
products in hospitals in the United States 
(5,143). However, several studies have 
demonstrated  that  alcohol-based  hand  rubs  containing  emollients  are  acceptable  to
HCWs 
(90,93,98,100,101,106, 143,163,164,166). 
With  alcohol-based  products,  the  time  required  for  drying  may  also  affect  user
acceptance.
 Studies  indicate  that  the  frequency  of  handwashing  or  antiseptic  handwashing  by
personnel is affected by the accessibility 
of  hand-hygiene  facilities  (280--283).  In  certain  health-care  facilities,  only  one  sink  is
available in rooms housing several patients, or sinks are located far away from the door
of  the  room,  which  may  discourage  handwashing  by  personnel  leaving  the  room.  In
intensive-care  units,  access  to  sinks  may  be  blocked  by  bedside  equipment  (e.g.,
ventilators or intravenous infusion pumps). 

In  contrast  to  sinks  used  for  handwashing  or  antiseptic  handwash,  dispensers  for
alcohol-based hand rubs do not 
require  plumbing  and  can  be  made  available  adjacent  to  each  patient's  bed  and  at
many other locations in patient-care areas. Pocket carriage of alcohol-based hand-rub
solutions,  combined  with  availability  of  bedside  dispensers,  has  been  associated  with
substantial improvement in adherence to hand-hygiene protocols 
(74,284). To avoid any confusion between soap and 
alcohol hand rubs, alcohol hand-rub dispensers should not be placed adjacent to sinks.
HCWs should be informed that washing hands with soap and water after each use of an
alcohol hand rub is not necessary and is not recommended, because it may lead 
to dermatitis. However, because personnel feel a "build-up" of emollients on their hands
after repeated use of alcohol hand gels, washing hands with soap and water after 5--10
applications of a gel has been recommended by certain manufacturers.
 Automated handwashing machines have not been demonstrated to improve the quality
or frequency of 
handwashing  (88,285).  Although  technologically  advanced  automated  handwashing
devices and monitoring systems have been developed recently, only a minimal number
of studies have been published that demonstrate that use of such devices results in 
enduring improvements in hand-hygiene adherence among HCWs. Further evaluation of
automated handwashing facilities 
and monitoring systems is warranted.
 Dispenser  systems  provided  by  manufacturers  or  vendors  also  must  be  considered
when  evaluating  hand-hygiene  products.  Dispensers  may  discourage  use  by  HCWs
when they 1) become blocked or partially blocked and do not deliver the 
product when accessed by personnel, and 2) do not deliver the product appropriately
onto the hands. In one hospital where a viscous alcohol-based hand rinse was available,

only 65% of functioning dispensers delivered product onto the caregivers' hands with
one press of the dispenser lever, and 9% of dispensers were totally occluded 
(286). In addition, the volume delivered was 
often suboptimal, and the product was sometimes squirted onto the wall instead of the
caregiver's hand.
 Only limited information is available regarding the cost of hand-hygiene products used
in health-care facilities (165,287). These costs were evaluated in patient-care areas at a
450-bed community teaching hospital 
(287);
 the
 hospital
 spent
 $22,000
 ($0.72
 per
 patient-day)
 on
 2%
chlorhexidine-containing  preparations,  plain  soap,  and  an  alcohol  hand  rinse.  (287)
When hand-hygiene supplies for clinics and nonpatient care areas were included, the
total annual budget for soaps and 
hand  antiseptic  agents  was  $30,000  (approximately  $1  per  patient-day).  Annual
hand-hygiene product budgets at other 
institutions  vary  considerably  because  of  differences  in  usage  patterns  and  varying
product prices. One researcher 
(287)  determined  that  if  non-antimicrobial  liquid  soap  were  assigned  an  arbitrary
relative cost of 1.0, the cost per liter would be 1.7 times as much for 2% chlorhexidine
gluconate detergent, 1.6--2.0 times higher for alcohol-based hand-rub products, and 4.5
times higher for 
an alcohol-based foam product. A recent cost comparison of surgical scrubbing with an
antimicrobial soap versus 
brushless 
scrubbing  with  an  alcohol-based  hand  rub  revealed  that  costs  and  time  required  for

preoperative scrubbing were less with 
the alcohol-based product (165). In a trial conducted in two critical-care units, the cost
of using an alcohol hand rub was half 
as  much  as  using  an  antimicrobial  soap  for  handwashing  ($0.025  versus  $0.05  per
application, respectively) 
(166). 
 To put expenditures for hand-hygiene products into perspective, health-care facilities
should consider comparing 
their  budget  for  hand-hygiene  products  to  estimated  excess  hospital  costs  resulting
from health-care--associated infections. 
The  excess  hospital  costs  associated  with  only  four  or  five  health-care--associated
infections of average severity may equal the 
entire annual budget for hand-hygiene products used in inpatient-care areas. Just one
severe surgical site infection, lower 
respiratory tract infection, or bloodstream infection may cost the hospital more than the
entire annual budget for antiseptic agents 
used for hand hygiene (287). Two studies provided certain quantitative estimates of the
benefit of 
hand-hygiene--promotion programs (72,74). One study demonstrated a cost saving of
approximately  $17,000  resulting  from  reduced  use  of  vancomycin  after  the  observed
decrease in MRSA incidence in a 7-month period 
(72). In another study that examined both direct 
costs associated with the hand-hygiene promotion program (increased use of hand-rub
solution and poster production) and 
indirect costs associated with health-care--personnel time 
(74), costs of the program were an estimated $57,000 or less per year 

(an average of $1.42 per patient admitted). Supplementary costs associated with the
increased use of alcohol-based 
hand-rub  solution  averaged  $6.07  per  100  patient-days.  Based  on  conservative
estimates of $2,100 saved per infection averted and on 
the  assumption  that  only  25%  of  the  observed  reduction  in  the  infection  rate  was
associated with improved hand-hygiene 
practice,  the  program  was  substantially  cost-effective.  Thus,  hospital  administrators
must consider that by purchasing more effective 
or more acceptable hand-hygiene products to improve hand-hygiene practices, they 
will avoid the occurrence of nosocomial infections; 
preventing  only  a  limited  number  of  additional  health-care--associated  infections  per
year will lead to savings 
that will exceed any incremental costs of improved hand-hygiene products.
      
Hand-Hygiene Practices Among HCWs
 In observational studies conducted in hospitals, HCWs washed their hands an average
of five times per shift to as many 
as 30 times per shift (Table 6) 
(17,61,90,98,274,288); certain nurses washed their hands 
<100 times per shift (90). 
Hospitalwide surveillance of hand hygiene reveals that the average number of 
handwashing opportunities varies markedly between 
hospital  wards.  For  example,  nurses  in  pediatric  wards  had  an  average  of  eight
opportunities for hand hygiene per hour of patient 

care compared with an average of 20 for nurses in intensive-care units 
(11). The duration of handwashing or hygienic 
handwash episodes by HCWs has averaged 6.6--24.0 seconds in observational studies
(Table 7) 
(17,52,59,84--87,89,249,279).  In  addition  to  washing  their  hands  for  limited  time
periods, personnel often fail to cover all surfaces of their hands and fingers (288).
 
Adherence of HCWs to Recommended Hand-Hygiene Practices
 Observational  Studies  of  Hand-Hygiene  Adherence.  Adherence  of  HCWs  to
recommended hand-hygiene procedures 
has been poor, with mean baseline rates of 5%--81% (overall average: 40%) (Table 8) 
(71,74,86,87,276,280,281,283,285,
 289--313).
 The
 methods
 used
 for
 defining
adherence  (or  nonadherence)  and  those  used  for  conducting  observations  vary
considerably  among  studies,  and  reports  do  not  provide  detailed  information
concerning the methods and criteria used. 
The  majority  of  studies  were  conducted  with  hand-hygiene  adherence  as  the  major
outcome measure, whereas a limited 
number measured adherence as part of a broader investigation. Several investigators
reported  improved  adherence  after  implementing  various  interventions,  but  the
majority of studies had short follow-up periods and did not confirm whether behavioral
improvements
 were
 long-lasting.
 Other
 studies
 established
 that
 sustained
improvements  in  handwashing  behavior  occurred  during  a  long-term  program  to
improve adherence to hand-hygiene policies 
(74,75).
 Factors Affecting Adherence. Factors that may influence hand hygiene include those
identified in epidemiologic 

studies  and  factors  reported  by  HCWs  as  being  reasons  for  lack  of  adherence  to
hand-hygiene recommendations. Risk factors for poor adherence to hand hygiene have
been determined objectively in several observational studies or interventions to 
improve adherence 
(11,12,274,292,295,314--317). Among these, being a physician or a nursing assistant,
rather than a 
nurse, was consistently associated with reduced adherence (Box 1).
 In the largest hospitalwide survey of hand-hygiene practices among HCWs 
(11),  predictors  of  poor  adherence  to  recommended  hand-hygiene  measures  were
identified.  Predictor  variables  included  professional  category,  hospital  ward,  time  of
day/week,  and  type  and  intensity  of  patient  care,  defined  as  the  number  of
opportunities for hand hygiene per hour of 
patient 
care. In 2,834 observed opportunities for hand hygiene, average adherence was 48%.
In multivariate analysis, 
nonadherence was lowest among nurses and during weekends (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.6;
95%  confidence  interval  [CI]  =  0.4--0.8).  Nonadherence  was  higher  in  intensive-care
units compared with internal medicine wards (OR: 2.0; 95% CI = 
1.3--3.1), during procedures that carried a high risk of bacterial contamination (OR: 1.8;
95% CI = 1.4--2.4), and when intensity of patient care was high (21--40 handwashing
opportunities --- OR: 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0-1.7; 41--60 opportunities --- OR: 
2.1; 95% CI = 1.5-2.9; >60 opportunities --- OR: 2.1; 95% CI = 1.3--3.5). The higher the
demand for hand hygiene, the lower the adherence; on average, adherence decreased
by 5% 

(+ 2%) for each increase of 10 opportunities per hour when the intensity 
of  patient  care  exceeded  10  opportunities  per  hour.  Similarly,  the  lowest  adherence
rate (36%) was found in intensive-care 
units, where indications for hand hygiene were typically more frequent (on average, 20
opportunities  per  patient-hour).  The  highest  adherence  rate  (59%)  was  observed  in
pediatrics wards, where the average intensity of patient care was lower than in other
hospital areas (an average of eight opportunities per patient-hour). The results of this
study indicate that full adherence to previous guidelines may be unrealistic, and that
facilitated access to hand hygiene could help improve adherence (11,12,318).
 Perceived barriers to adherence with hand-hygiene practice recommendations include
skin irritation caused by 
hand-hygiene
 agents,
 inaccessible
 hand-hygiene
 supplies,
 interference
 with
HCW-patient  relationships,  priority  of  care  (i.e.,  the  patients'  needs  are  given  priority
over  hand  hygiene),  wearing  of  gloves,  forgetfulness,  lack  of  knowledge  of  the
guidelines, 
insufficient  time  for  hand  hygiene,  high  workload  and  understaffing,  and  the  lack  of
scientific  information  indicating  a  definitive  impact  of  improved  hand  hygiene  on
health-care--associated infection rates 
(11,274,292,295,315--317). Certain perceived barriers 
to  adherence  with  hand-hygiene  guidelines  have  been  assessed  or  quantified  in
observational studies (12,274,292,295,314--317) (Box 1).
 Skin irritation by hand-hygiene agents constitutes a substantial barrier to appropriate
adherence 
(319). Because soaps and detergents can damage skin when applied on a regular basis,
HCWs must be better informed regarding the possible adverse effects associated with
hand-hygiene  agents.  Lack  of  knowledge  and  education  regarding  this  subject  is  a

barrier to 
motivation.  In  several  studies,  alcohol-based  hand  rubs  containing  emollients  (either
isopropanol, ethanol, or n-propanol in 
60%--90% vol/vol) were less irritating to the skin than the soaps or detergents tested. In
addition,  the  alcohol-based  products  containing  emollients  that  were  tested  were  at
least as tolerable and efficacious as the detergents tested. Also, studies demonstrate
that  several  hand  lotions  have  reduced  skin  scaling  and  cracking,  which  may  reduce
microbial shedding from the 
hands (67,272,273).
 Easy  access  to  hand-hygiene  supplies,  whether  sink,  soap,  medicated  detergent,  or
alcohol-based hand-rub solution, 
is  essential  for  optimal  adherence  to  hand-hygiene  recommendations.  The  time
required for nurses to leave a patient's bedside, 
go  to  a  sink,  and  wash  and  dry  their  hands  before  attending  the  next  patient  is  a
deterrent to frequent handwashing or 
hand  antisepsis  (11,318).  Engineering  controls  could  facilitate  adherence,  but  careful
monitoring  of  hand-hygiene  behavior  should  be  conducted  to  exclude  the  possible
negative effect of newly introduced handwashing devices 
(88).
  The  impact  of  wearing  gloves  on  adherence  to  hand-hygiene  policies  has  not  been
definitively established, because 
published studies have yielded contradictory results 
(87,290,301,320). Hand hygiene is required regardless of whether gloves are used 
or  changed.  Failure  to  remove  gloves  after  patient  contact  or  between  "dirty"  and
"clean"  body-site  care  on  the  same  patient  must  be  regarded  as  nonadherence  to
hand-hygiene recommendations 

(11). In a study in which experimental 
conditions approximated those occurring in clinical practice 
(321), washing and reusing gloves between patient contacts resulted 
in observed bacterial counts of 0--4.7 log on the hands after glove removal. Therefore,
this practice should be 
discouraged; handwashing or disinfection should be performed after glove removal.
 Lack of 1) knowledge of guidelines for hand hygiene, 2) recognition of hand-hygiene
opportunities during patient care, and 3) awareness of the risk of cross-transmission of
pathogens  are  barriers  to  good  hand-hygiene  practices.  Furthermore,  certain  HCWs
believe  they  have  washed  their  hands  when  necessary,  even  when  observations
indicate they have 
not (89,92,295,296,322).
 Perceived barriers to hand-hygiene behavior are linked not only to the institution, but
also to HCWs' colleagues. Therefore, both institutional and small-group dynamics need
to  be  considered  when  implementing  a  system  change  to  secure  an  improvement  in
HCWs' hand-hygiene practice.
 
Possible Targets for Hand-Hygiene Promotion
 Targets  for  the  promotion  of  hand  hygiene  are  derived  from  studies  assessing  risk
factors
 for
 nonadherence,
 reported
 reasons
 for
 the
 lack
 of
 adherence
 to
recommendations,  and  additional  factors  perceived  as  being  important  to  facilitate
appropriate HCW behavior. Although certain factors cannot be modified (Box 1), others
can be changed.
 One factor that must be addressed is the time required for HCWs to clean their hands.
The  time  required  for  traditional  handwashing  may  render  full  adherence  to  previous

guidelines unrealistic 
(11,12,318) and more rapid access to 
hand-hygiene  materials  could  help  improve  adherence.  One  study  conducted  in  an
intensive-care unit demonstrated that it took nurses 
an average of 62 seconds to leave a patient's bedside, walk to a sink, wash their hands,
and return to patient care 
(318).  In  contrast,  an  estimated  one  fourth  as  much  time  is  required  when  using
alcohol-based  hand  rub  placed  at  each  patient's  bedside.  Providing  easy  access  to
hand-hygiene materials is mandatory for appropriate hand-hygiene behavior 
and is achievable in the majority of health-care facilities 
(323). In particular, in high-demand situations (e.g., the majority of critical-care units), 
under hectic working conditions, and at times of overcrowding or understaffing, HCWs
may be more likely to use an 
alcohol-based hand rub than to wash their hands 
(323). Further, using alcohol-based hand rubs may be a better option than 
traditional  handwashing  with  plain  soap  and  water  or  antiseptic  handwash,  because
they not only require less time 
(166,318) but act faster (1) and irritate hands less often 
(1,67,96,98,166). They also were used in the only program that reported a sustained
improvement in hand-hygiene adherence associated with decreased infection rates 
(74).  However,  making  an  alcohol-based  hand  rub  available  to  personnel  without
providing ongoing educational and motivational activities may not result in long-lasting
improvement in hand-hygiene practices 
(313). Because increased use of hand-hygiene agents might be associated 

with skin dryness, the availability of free skin-care lotion is recommended.
 Education is a cornerstone for improvement with hand-hygiene practices. Topics that
must be addressed by 
educational  programs  include  the  lack  of  1)  scientific  information  for  the  definitive
impact  of  improved  hand  hygiene  on  health-care--associated  infection  and  resistant
organism  transmission  rates;  2)  awareness  of  guidelines  for  hand  hygiene  and
insufficient  knowledge  concerning  indications  for  hand  hygiene  during  daily  patient
care; 3) knowledge concerning the low average adherence rate to hand hygiene by the
majority  of  HCWs;  and  4)  knowledge  concerning  the  appropriateness,  efficacy,  and
understanding of the use of hand-hygiene and skin-care--protection agents.
 HCWs necessarily evolve within a group that functions within an institution. Possible
targets  for  improvement  in  hand-hygiene  behavior  not  only  include  factors  linked  to
individual HCWs, but also those related to the group(s) and the 
institution  as  a  whole  (317,323).  Examples  of  possible  targets  for  hand-hygiene
promotion  at  the  group  level  include  education  and  performance  feedback  on
hand-hygiene  adherence;  efforts  to  prevent  high  workload,  downsizing,  and
understaffing; 
and encouragement and provision of role models from key members in the work unit.
At the institutional level, targets 
for  improvement  include  1)  written  guidelines,  hand-hygiene  agents,  skin-care
promotions and agents, or hand-hygiene facilities; 2) culture or tradition of adherence;
and  3)  administrative  leadership,  sanction,  support,  and  rewards.  Several  studies,
conducted  in  various  types  of  institutions,  reported  modest  and  even  low  levels  of
adherence  to  recommended  hand-hygiene  practices,  indicating  that  such  adherence
varied  by  hospital  ward  and  by  type  of  HCW.  These  results  indicate  educational
sessions may need to be designed specifically for certain types of personnel 

(11,289,290,294,317,323).
      
Lessons Learned from Behavioral Theories
 In  1998,  the  prevailing  behavioral  theories  and  their  applications  with  regard  to  the
health  professions  were  reviewed  by  researchers  in  an  attempt  to  better  understand
how to target more successful interventions 
(317).  The  researchers  proposed  a  hypothetical  framework  to  enhance  hand-hygiene
practices and stressed the importance of considering the complexity of individual and
institutional factors when designing behavioral interventions.
 Although  behavioral  theories  and  secondary  interventions  have  primarily  targeted
individual workers, this practice might 
be insufficient to produce sustained change 
(317,324,325). Interventions aimed at improving hand-hygiene practices 
must  account  for  different  levels  of  behavior  interaction  (12,317,326).  Thus,  the
interdependence of individual 
factors,  environmental  constraints,  and  the  institutional  climate  must  be  taken  into
account in the strategic planning and 
development  of  hand-hygiene  campaigns.  Interventions  to  promote  hand  hygiene  in
hospitals  should  consider  variables  at  all  these  levels.  Various  factors  involved  in
hand-hygiene  behavior  include  intention,  attitude  towards  the  behavior,  perceived
social  norm,  perceived  behavioral  control,  perceived  risk  for  infection,  hand-hygiene
practices, perceived role model, perceived 

knowledge,  and  motivation  (317).  The  factors  necessary  for  change  include  1)
dissatisfaction with the current situation, 2) perception of 
alternatives,  and  3)  recognition,  both  at  the  individual  and  institutional  level,  of  the
ability and potential to change. 
Although  the  latter  implies  education  and  motivation,  the  former  two  necessitate  a
system change.
 Among the reported reasons for poor adherence with 
hand-hygiene recommendations (Box 1), certain ones are 
clearly  associated  with  the  institution  or  system  (e.g.,  lack  of  institutional  priority  for
hand  hygiene,  administrative  sanctions,  and  a  safety  climate).  Although  all  of  these
reasons would require a system change in the majority of institutions, the third 
requires management commitment, visible safety programs, 
an acceptable level of work stress, a tolerant and supportive attitude 
toward reported problems, and belief in the efficacy of preventive strategies 
(12,317,325,327). Most importantly, an improvement 
in  infection-control  practices  requires  1)  questioning  basic  beliefs,  2)  continuous
assessment of the group (or individual) stage 
of behavioral change, 3) intervention(s) with an appropriate process of change, and 4)
supporting individual and group 
creativity  (317).  Because  of  the  complexity  of  the  process  of  change,  single
interventions  often  fail.  Thus,  a  multimodal,  multidisciplinary  strategy  is  likely
necessary 
(74,75,317,323,326).
      

Methods Used To Promote Improved Hand Hygiene
 Hand-hygiene  promotion  has  been  challenging  for  >150  years.  In-service  education,
information leaflets, workshops and lectures, automated dispensers, and performance
feedback  on  hand-hygiene  adherence  rates  have  been  associated  with  transient
improvement (291,294--296,306,314).
 Several  strategies  for  promotion  of  hand  hygiene  in  hospitals  have  been  published
(Table  9).  These  strategies  require  education,  motivation,  or  system  change.  Certain
strategies are based on epidemiologic evidence, others on the 
authors'  and  other  investigators'  experience  and  review  of  current  knowledge.  Some
strategies may be unnecessary in certain circumstances, but may be helpful in others.
In  particular,  changing  the  hand-hygiene  agent  could  be  beneficial  in  institutions  or
hospital  wards  with  a  high  workload  and  a  high  demand  for  hand  hygiene  when
alcohol-based hand rubs are not 
available (11,73,78,328). However, a change in the recommended hand-hygiene agent
could  be  deleterious  if  introduced  during  winter,  at  a  time  of  higher  hand-skin
irritability, and if 
not accompanied by the provision of skin-care products (e.g., protective 
creams and lotions). Additional specific elements should be considered for inclusion in
educational and motivational programs 
(Box 2).
 Several  strategies  that  could  potentially  be  associated  with  successful  promotion  of
hand hygiene require a system 
change  (Box  1).  Hand-hygiene  adherence  and  promotion  involve  factors  at  both  the
individual and system level. Enhancing 

individual  and  institutional  attitudes  regarding  the  feasibility  of  making  changes
(self-efficacy), obtaining active participation of personnel at both levels, and promoting
an institutional safety climate represent challenges that exceed the current perception
of the role of infection-control professionals.
 Whether  increased  education,  individual  reinforcement  technique,  appropriate
rewarding, administrative sanction, 
enhanced  self-participation,  active  involvement  of  a  larger  number  of  organizational
leaders,  enhanced  perception  of  health  threat,  self-efficacy,  and  perceived  social
pressure 
(12,317,329,330), or combinations of these factors can improve HCWs' adherence 
with hand hygiene needs further investigation. Ultimately, adherence to recommended
hand-hygiene practices should become 
part  of  a  culture  of  patient  safety  where  a  set  of  interdependent  quality  elements
interact to achieve a shared objective (331).
 On  the  basis  of  both  these  hypothetical  considerations  and  successful,  actual
experiences  in  certain  institutions,  strategies  to  improve  adherence  to  hand-hygiene
practices should be both multimodal and multidisciplinary. However, strategies must 
be further researched before they are implemented.
      
Efficacy of Promotion and Impact of Improved Hand Hygiene
 The lack of scientific information of the definitive impact of improved hand hygiene on
health-care--associated 
infection  rates  is  a  possible  barrier  to  appropriate  adherence  with  hand-hygiene

recommendations (Box 1). However, evidence supports the belief that improved hand
hygiene  can  reduce  health-care--associated  infection  rates.  Failure  to  perform
appropriate  hand  hygiene  is  considered  the  leading  cause  of  health-care--associated
infections and spread of multiresistant organisms and 
has been recognized as a substantial contributor to outbreaks.
 Of  nine  hospital-based  studies  of  the  impact  of  hand  hygiene  on  the  risk  of
health-care--associated
 infections
 (Table
 10)
 (48,69--75,296),
 the
 majority
demonstrated  a  temporal  relationship  between  improved  hand-hygiene  practices  and
reduced infection rates.
 In one of these studies, endemic MRSA in a neonatal intensive-care unit was eliminated
7 months after introduction of a 
new  hand  antiseptic  (1%  triclosan);  all  other  infection-control  measures  remained  in
place, including the practice of 
conducting weekly active surveillance by obtaining cultures 
(72). Another study reported an MRSA outbreak involving 22 infants in 
a neonatal unit (73). Despite intensive efforts, the outbreak could not be controlled until
a new antiseptic was added (i.e., 0.3% triclosan); all previously used control measures
remained in place, including gloves and gowns, cohorting, and 
obtaining cultures for active surveillance.
 The effectiveness of a longstanding, hospitalwide program to promote hand hygiene at
the University of Geneva 
hospitals  was  recently  reported  (74).  Overall  adherence  to  hand-hygiene  guidelines
during routine patient care was monitored during hospitalwide observational surveys.
These surveys were conducted biannually during December 1994--December 1997, 

before  and  during  implementation  of  a  hand-hygiene  campaign  that  specifically
emphasized the practice of bedside, 
alcohol-based  hand  disinfection.  Individual-sized  bottles  of  hand-rub  solution  were
distributed  to  all  wards,  and  custom-made  holders  were  mounted  on  all  beds  to
facilitate  access  to  hand  disinfection.  HCWs  were  also  encouraged  to  carry  bottles  in
their pockets, 
and  in  1996,  a  newly  designed  flat  (instead  of  round)  bottle  was  made  available  to
further  facilitate  pocket  carriage.  The  promotional  strategy  was  multimodal  and
involved a multidisciplinary team of HCWs, the use of wall posters, the 
promotion of antiseptic hand rubs located at bedsides throughout the institution, and
regular performance feedback to all HCWs (see 
      http://www.hopisafe.ch for further details on methodology). Health-care--associated
infection rates, attack rates of 
MRSA cross-transmission, and consumption of hand-rub disinfectant were 
measured. Adherence to recommended 
hand-hygiene practices improved progressively from 48% in 1994 to 66% in 1997 (p <
0.001).  Whereas  recourse  to  handwashing  with  soap  and  water  remained  stable,
frequency of hand disinfection markedly increased during the study period (p < 0.001),
and 
the  consumption  of  alcohol-based  hand-rub  solution  increased  from  3.5  to  15.4  liters
per 1,000 patient-days during 
1993--1998 (p < 0.001). The increased frequency of hand disinfection was unchanged
after  adjustment  for  known  risk  factors  of  poor  adherence.  During  the  same  period,
both overall health-care--associated infection and MRSA transmission rates 

decreased  (both  p  <  0.05).  The  observed  reduction  in  MRSA  transmission  may  have
been affected by both improved 
hand-hygiene  adherence  and  the  simultaneous  implementation  of  active  surveillance
cultures for detecting and isolating patients colonized with MRSA (332). The experience
from the University of Geneva hospitals constitutes the first report of a hand-hygiene
campaign with a sustained improvement over several years. An additional multimodal
program also yielded 
sustained improvements in hand-hygiene practices over an extended period (75); the
majority of studies have been limited to a 6- to 9-month observation period. 
 Although these studies were not designed to assess the independent contribution of
hand hygiene on the prevention 
of  health-care--associated  infections,  the  results  indicate  that  improved  hand-hygiene
practices reduce the risk of transmission 
of pathogenic microorganisms. The beneficial effects of hand-hygiene promotion on the
risk of cross-transmission also have 
been reported in surveys conducted in schools and day care centers 
(333--338), as well as in a community setting 
(339--341).
      
Other Policies Related to Hand Hygiene
 
Fingernails and Artificial Nails
 Studies have documented that subungual areas of the hand harbor high concentrations

of bacteria, most 
frequently coagulase-negative staphylococci, gram-negative rods (including 
Pseudomonas spp.), Corynebacteria, and yeasts 
(14,342,343).  Freshly  applied  nail  polish  does  not  increase  the  number  of  bacteria
recovered from periungual skin, but chipped nail 
polish may support the growth of larger numbers of organisms on fingernails 
(344,345). Even after careful handwashing or the use 
of surgical scrubs, personnel often harbor substantial numbers of potential pathogens in
the subungual spaces 
(346--348).
 Whether artificial nails contribute to transmission of health-care--associated infections
is unknown. However, HCWs 
who  wear  artificial  nails  are  more  likely  to  harbor  gram-negative  pathogens  on  their
fingertips than are those who have natural 
nails, both before and after handwashing 
(347--349). Whether the length of natural or artificial nails is a substantial risk factor 
is unknown, because the majority of bacterial growth occurs along the proximal 1 mm
of the nail adjacent to subungual 
skin (345,347,348). Recently, an outbreak of 
P. aeruginosa in a neonatal intensive care unit was attributed to two nurses (one 
with  long  natural  nails  and  one  with  long  artificial  nails)  who  carried  the  implicated
strains of 
Pseudomonas  spp.  on  their  hands  (350).  Patients  were  substantially  more  likely  than
controls  to  have  been  cared  for  by  the  two  nurses  during  the  exposure  period,
indicating that colonization of long or artificial nails with 
Pseudomonas spp. may have contributed to causing 
the 

outbreak. Personnel wearing artificial nails also have been epidemiologically implicated
in several other outbreaks of 
infection caused by gram-negative bacilli and yeast 
(351--353). Although these studies provide evidence that wearing artificial nails 
poses an infection hazard, additional studies are warranted.
 
Gloving Policies
 CDC  has  recommended  that  HCWs  wear  gloves  to  1)  reduce  the  risk  of  personnel
acquiring infections from patients, 
2) prevent health-care worker flora from being transmitted to patients, and 3) reduce
transient contamination of the hands 
of personnel by flora that can be transmitted from one patient to another 
(354).  Before  the  emergence  of  the  acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)
epidemic,  gloves  were  worn  primarily  by  personnel  caring  for  patients  colonized  or
infected with certain pathogens or by personnel exposed to patients with a high risk of
hepatitis B. Since 1987, a 
dramatic increase in glove use has occurred in an effort to prevent transmission of HIV
and other bloodborne pathogens from patients to HCWs (355). The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) mandates that gloves be worn during all patient-care
activities that may involve exposure to blood or body fluids that may be contaminated
with blood (356).
 The  effectiveness  of  gloves  in  preventing  contamination  of  HCWs'  hands  has  been
confirmed in several clinical 

studies (45,51,58). One study found that HCWs who wore gloves during patient contact
contaminated their hands with an average of only 3 CFUs per minute of patient care,
compared with 16 CFUs per minute for those not wearing gloves 
(51). Two other studies, involving personnel caring for patients with 
C. difficile or VRE, revealed that wearing gloves prevented 
hand  contamination  among  the  majority  of  personnel  having  direct  contact  with
patients 
(45,58).  Wearing  gloves  also  prevented  personnel  from  acquiring  VRE  on  their  hands
when
 touching
 contaminated
 environmental
 surfaces
 (58).
 Preventing
 heavy
contamination  of  the  hands  is  considered  important,  because  handwashing  or  hand
antisepsis  may  not  remove  all  potential  pathogens  when  hands  are  heavily
contaminated 
(25,111).
 Several studies provide evidence that wearing gloves can help reduce transmission of
pathogens in health-care settings. In 
a  prospective  controlled  trial  that  required  personnel  to  routinely  wear  vinyl  gloves
when handling any body substances, 
the  incidence  of  C.  difficile  diarrhea  among  patients  decreased  from  7.7  cases/1,000
patient discharges before the intervention 
to 1.5 cases/1,000 discharges during the intervention 
(226). The prevalence of asymptomatic C. 
difficile  carriage  also  decreased  substantially  on  "glove"  wards,  but  not  on  control
wards.  In  intensive-care  units  where  VRE  or  MRSA  have  been  epidemic,  requiring  all
HCWs to wear gloves to care for all patients in the unit (i.e., universal glove use) likely

has helped 
control outbreaks (357,358).
 The  influence  of  glove  use  on  the  hand-hygiene  habits  of  personnel  is  not  clear.
Several studies found that personnel 
who wore gloves were less likely to wash their hands upon leaving a patient's room 
(290,320). In contrast, two other studies 
found  that  personnel  who  wore  gloves  were  substantially  more  likely  to  wash  their
hands after patient care 
(87,301).
 The following caveats regarding use of gloves by HCWs must be considered. Personnel
should be informed that gloves 
do  not  provide  complete  protection  against  hand  contamination.  Bacterial  flora
colonizing patients may be recovered from 
the hands of <30% of HCWs who wear gloves during patient contact 
(50,58). Further, wearing gloves does not provide 
complete  protection  against  acquisition  of  infections  caused  by  hepatitis  B  virus  and
herpes simplex virus 
(359,360).  In  such  instances,  pathogens  presumably  gain  access  to  the  caregiver's
hands  via  small  defects  in  gloves  or  by  contamination  of  the  hands  during  glove
removal (50,321,359,361).
 Gloves used by HCWs are usually made of natural rubber latex and synthetic nonlatex
materials (e.g., vinyl, nitrile, 
and  neoprene  [polymers  and  copolymers  of  chloroprene]).  Because  of  the  increasing
prevalence  of  latex  sensitivity  among  HCWs  and  patients,  FDA  has  approved  several
powdered and 
powder-free latex gloves with reduced protein contents, as well 

as  synthetic  gloves  that  can  be  made  available  by  health-care  institutions  for  use  by
latex-sensitive employees. In published studies, the barrier integrity of gloves varies on
the basis of type and quality of glove material, intensity of use, length of time used,
manufacturer,  whether  gloves  were  tested  before  or  after  use,  and  method  used  to
detect glove leaks 
(359,361--366).  In  published  studies,  vinyl  gloves  have  had  defects  more  frequently
than  latex  gloves,  the  difference  in  defect  frequency  being  greatest  after  use
(359,361,364,367). However, intact vinyl gloves provide protection comparable to that
of latex gloves (359). Limited studies indicate that nitrile gloves have leakage rates that
approximate those of latex gloves 
(368--371). Having more than one type of glove available is desirable, because it allows
personnel to select the type that best suits their patient-care activities. Although recent
studies indicate that improvements have been made in the quality of gloves 
(366), hands should be decontaminated or washed after removing gloves 
(8,50,58,321,361). Gloves should not be washed or reused 
(321,361).  Use  of  petroleum-based  hand  lotions  or  creams  may  adversely  affect  the
integrity of latex gloves (372). After use of powdered gloves, 
certain alcohol hand rubs may interact with residual powder on the hands of personnel,
resulting in a gritty feeling on 
the hands. In facilities where powdered gloves are commonly used, various 
alcohol-based hand rubs should be tested after removal 
of powdered gloves to avoid selecting a product that causes this undesirable reaction.
Personnel  should  be  reminded  that  failure  to  remove  gloves  between  patients  may

contribute to transmission of organisms 
(358,373).
 
Jewelry
 Several  studies  have  demonstrated  that  skin  underneath  rings  is  more  heavily
colonized than comparable areas of skin 
on  fingers  without  rings  (374--376).  One  study  found  that  40%  of  nurses  harbored
gram-negative bacilli (e.g., 
E. cloacae, Klebsiella, and 
Acinetobacter) on skin under rings and that certain nurses carried the same organism
under their rings for 
several months (375). In a more recent study involving >60 intensive care unit nurses,
multivariable  analysis  revealed  that  rings  were  the  only  substantial  risk  factor  for
carriage of gram-negative bacilli and 
S. aureus and that the concentration of 
organisms recovered correlated with the number of rings worn 
(377). Whether the wearing of rings results in greater transmission 
of pathogens is unknown. Two studies determined that mean bacterial colony counts on
hands after handwashing were 
similar among persons wearing rings and those not wearing rings 
(376,378). Further studies are needed to establish if wearing 
rings results in greater transmission of pathogens in health-care settings.
      
Hand-Hygiene Research Agenda

 Although  the  number  of  published  studies  concerning  hand  hygiene  has  increased
considerably  in  recent  years,  many  questions  regarding  hand-hygiene  products  and
strategies  for  improving  adherence  of  personnel  to  recommended  policies  remain
unanswered. Several concerns must still be addressed 
by researchers in industry and by clinical investigators (Box 3).

 These recommendations are designed to improve hand-hygiene practices of HCWs and
to reduce transmission of 
pathogenic  microorganisms  to  patients  and  personnel  in  health-care  settings.  This
guideline  and  its  recommendations  are  not  intended  for  use  in  food  processing  or

food-service establishments, and are not meant to replace guidance provided by FDA's
Model 
Food Code.
 As  in  previous  CDC/HICPAC  guidelines,  each  recommendation  is  categorized  on  the
basis of existing scientific 
data, theoretical rationale, applicability, and economic impact. The CDC/HICPAC system
for categorizing recommendations is 
as follows: 
Category  IA.  Strongly  recommended  for  implementation  and  strongly  supported  by
well-designed experimental, clinical, 
or epidemiologic studies. 
Category  IB.  Strongly  recommended  for  implementation  and  supported  by  certain
experimental, clinical, or 
epidemiologic studies and a strong theoretical rationale. 
Category IC. Required for implementation, as mandated by federal or state regulation
or standard.
      
Category  II.  Suggested  for  implementation  and  supported  by  suggestive  clinical  or
epidemiologic studies or a 
theoretical rationale. 
No recommendation. Unresolved issue. Practices for which insufficient evidence or no
consensus regarding efficacy exist.

 *  In  a  recent  randomized  clinical  trial,  surgical  site  infection  rates  were  monitored
among patients who were operated on by surgical personnel who cleaned their hands
preoperatively either by performing a traditional 5-minute surgical hand scrub using 4%
povidone-iodine or 4% antisepsis antimicrobial soap, or 
by  washing  their  hands  for  1  minute  with  a  non-antimicrobial  soap  followed  by  a
5-minute hand-rubbing technique using an alcohol-based hand rinse 
containing 0.2% mecetronium etilsulfate. The incidence of surgical site infections was
virtually identical in the two groups of patients.
