current  recommendations  for  the  prevention  of  measles,  rubella,  congenital  rubella
syndrome (CRS), and mumps. The report presents the recent revisions adopted by the
Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization  Practices  (ACIP)  on  October  24,  2012,  and  also
summarizes  all  existing  ACIP  recommendations  that  have  been  published  previously
during 1998–2011 (CDC. Measles, mumps, and rubella—vaccine use and strategies for

health-care  personnel:  recommendations  of  the  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization
Practices  (ACIP).  MMWR  2011;60[No.  RR-7]).Currently,  ACIP  recommends  2  doses  of
MMR vaccine routinely for children with the first dose administered at age 12 through
15 months and the second dose administered at age 4 through 6 years before school
entry.  Two  doses  are  recommended  for  adults  at  high  risk  for  exposure  and

transmission  (e.g.,  students  attending  colleges  or  other  post-high  school  educational
institutions,  health-care  personnel,  and  international  travelers)  and  1  dose  for  other
adults  aged  ≥18  years.  For  prevention  of  rubella,  1  dose  of  MMR  vaccine  is
recommended for persons aged ≥12 months. At the October 24, 2012 meeting, ACIP
adopted  the  following  revisions,  which  are  published  here  for  the  first  time.  These
included:  As  a  compendium  of  all  current  recommendations  for  the  prevention  of
measles,  rubella,  congenital  rubella  syndrome  (CRS),  and  mumps,  the  information  in
this  report  is  intended  for  use  by  clinicians  as  baseline  guidance  for  scheduling  of
vaccinations  for  these  conditions  and  considerations  regarding  vaccination  of  special
populations.  ACIP  recommendations  are  reviewed  periodically  and  are  revised  as
indicated when new information becomes available. Measles, rubella, and mumps are
acute  viral  diseases  that  can  cause  serious  disease  and  complications  of  disease  but
can  be  prevented  with  vaccination.  Vaccines  for  prevention  of  measles,  rubella,  and
mumps were licensed and recommended for use in the United States in the 1960s and
1970s.  Because  of  successful  vaccination  programs,  measles,  rubella,  congenital
rubella syndrome (CRS), and mumps are now uncommon in the United States. However,
recent
 outbreaks
 of
 measles
 (1)
 and
 mumps
 (2,3)
 have
 occurred
 from
import-associated cases because these diseases are common in many other countries.
Persons who are unvaccinated put themselves and others at risk for these diseases and
related  complications.  Two  live  attenuated  vaccines  are  licensed  and  available  in  the
United States to prevent measles, mumps, and rubella: MMR vaccine (measles, mumps,
and rubella [M-M-R II, Merck & Co., Inc.]), which is indicated routinely for persons aged
≥12 months and infants aged ≥6 months who are traveling internationally and MMRV
vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella [ProQuad, Merck & Co., Inc.]) licensed
for  children  aged  12  months  through  12  years.  For  the  purposes  of  this  report,  MMR
vaccine will be used as a general term for measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination;
however,  age-appropriate  use  of  either  licensed  vaccine  formulation  can  be  used  to

implement  these  vaccination  recommendations.   For  the  prevention  of  measles,
mumps,  and  rubella,  vaccination  is  recommended  for  persons  aged  ≥12  months.  For
the  prevention  of  measles  and  mumps,  ACIP  recommends  2  doses  of  MMR  vaccine
routinely for children with the first dose administered at age 12 through 15 months and
the second dose administered at age 4 through 6 years before school entry. Two doses
are recommended for adults at high risk for exposure and transmission (e.g., students
attending  colleges  or  other  post-high  school  educational  institutions,  health-care
personnel, and international travelers) and 1 dose for other adults aged ≥18 years. For
prevention of rubella, 1 dose of MMR vaccine is recommended for persons aged ≥12
months. This report is a compendium of all current recommendations for the prevention
of  measles,  rubella,  congenital  rubella  syndrome  (CRS),  and  mumps.  The  report
presents  the  recent  revisions  adopted  by  the  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization
Practices  (ACIP)  on  October  24,  2012,  and  also  summarizes  all  existing  ACIP
recommendations  that  have  been  published  previously  during  1998–2011  (4–6).  As  a
compendium  of  all  current  ACIP  recommendations,  the  information  in  this  report  is
intended  for  use  by  clinicians  as  guidance  for  scheduling  of  vaccinations  for  these
conditions and considerations regarding vaccination of special populations. Periodically,
ACIP reviews available information to inform the development or revision of its vaccine
recommendations. In May 2011, the ACIP measles, rubella, and mumps work group was
formed to review and revise previously published vaccine recommendations. The work
group held teleconference meetings monthly from May 2011 through October 2012. In
addition  to  ACIP  members,  the  work  group  included  participants  from  the  American
Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the
American College Health Association, the Association of Immunization Managers, CDC,
the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the National Advisory Committee on
Immunization  (Canada),  the  National  Institute  of  Health  (NIH),  and  other  infectious

disease  experts  (7).*  Issues  reviewed  and  considered  by  the  work  group  included
epidemiology of measles, rubella, CRS, and mumps in the United States; use of MMR
vaccine  among  persons  with  HIV  infection,  specifically,  revaccination  of  persons  with
perinatal  HIV  infection  who  were  vaccinated  before  effective  antiretroviral  therapy
(ART);  use  of  a  third  dose  of  MMR  vaccine  for  mumps  outbreak  control;  timing  of
vaccine doses; use of immune globulin (IG) for measles postexposure prophylaxis; and
vaccine  safety.  Recommendation  options  were  developed  and  discussed  by  the  work
group. When evidence was lacking, the recommendations incorporated expert opinion
of the work group members. Proposed revisions and a draft statement were presented
to  ACIP  (ACIP  meeting  October  2011;  February  and  June  2012)  and  approved  at  the
October  2012  ACIP  meeting.  ACIP  meeting  minutes,  including  declaration  of  ACIP

classified  as  a  member  of  the  genus  Morbillivirus  in  the  family  Paramyxoviridae.
Measles is a highly contagious rash illness that is transmitted from person to person by
direct contact with respiratory droplets or airborne spread. After exposure, up to 90% of
susceptible persons develop measles. The average incubation period for measles is 10
to 12 days from exposure to prodrome and 14 days from exposure to rash (range: 7–21
days).  Persons  with  measles  are  infectious  4  days  before  through  4  days  after  rash
onset.  In  the  United  States,  from  1987  to  2000,  the  most  commonly  reported
complications  associated  with  measles  infection  were  pneumonia  (6%),  otitis  media
(7%),  and  diarrhea  (8%)  (8).  For  every  1,000  reported  measles  cases  in  the  United
States, approximately one case of encephalitis and two to three deaths resulted (9–11).
The  risk  for  death  from  measles  or  its  complications  is  greater  for  infants,  young
children, and adults than for older children and adolescents. In low to middle income
countries  where  malnutrition  is  common,  measles  is  often  more  severe  and  the
case-fatality ratio can be as high as 25% (12). In addition, measles can be severe and

prolonged  among  immunocompromised  persons,  particularly  those  who  have
leukemias,  lymphomas,  or  HIV  infection  (13–15).  Among  these  persons,  measles  can
occur without the typical rash and a patient can shed measles virus for several weeks
after  the  acute  illness  (16–18).  However,  a  fatal  measles  case  without  rash  also  has
been reported in an apparently immunocompetent person (19). Pregnant women also
might  be  at  high  risk  for  severe  measles  and  complications;  however,  available
evidence  does  not  support  an  association  between  measles  in  pregnancy  and
congenital  defects  (20).  Measles  illness  in  pregnancy  might  be  associated  with
increased  rates  of  spontaneous  abortion,  premature  labor  and  preterm  delivery,  and
low  birthweight  among  affected  infants  (20–23).  A  persistent  measles  virus  infection
can  result  in  subacute  sclerosing  panencephalitis  (SSPE),  a  rare  and  usually  fatal
neurologic  degenerative  disease.  The  risk  for  developing  SSPE  is  4–11  per  100,000
measles cases (24,25), but can be higher when measles occurs among children aged
<2  years  (25,26).  Signs  and  symptoms  of  SSPE  appear  an  average  of  7  years  after
measles  infection,  but  might  appear  decades  later  (27).  Widespread  use  of  measles
vaccine has led to the virtual disappearance of SSPE in the United States, but imported
cases still occur (28). Available epidemiologic and virologic data indicate that measles
vaccine virus does not cause SSPE (27). Wild type measles virus nucleotide sequences
have  been  detected  consistently  from  persons  with  SSPE  who  have  reported
vaccination and no history of natural infection (24,29–34). Before implementation of the
national  measles  vaccination  program  in  1963,  measles  occurred  in  epidemic  cycles
and  virtually  every  person  acquired  measles  before  adulthood  (an  estimated  3  to  4
million  persons  acquired  measles  each  year).  Approximately  500,000  persons  with
measles  were  reported  each  year  in  the  United  States,  of  whom  500  persons  died,
48,000  were  hospitalized,  and  another  1,000  had  permanent  brain  damage  from
measles  encephalitis  (28).  After  the  introduction  of  the  1-dose  measles  vaccination
program, the number of reported measles cases decreased during the late 1960s and

early  1970s  to  approximately  22,000–75,000  cases  per  year  (Figure  1)  (35,36).
Although  measles  incidence  decreased  substantially  in  all  age  groups,  the  greatest
decrease  occurred  among  children  aged  <10  years.  During  1984  through  1988,  an
average  of  3,750  cases  was  reported  each  year  (37).  However,  measles  outbreaks
among  school-aged  children  who  had  received  1  dose  of  measles  vaccine  prompted
ACIP  in  1989  to  recommend  that  all  children  receive  2  doses  of  measles-containing
vaccine,  preferably  as  MMR  vaccine  (38,39).  The  second  dose  of  measles-containing
vaccine primarily was intended to induce immunity in the small percentage of persons
who  did  not  seroconvert  after  vaccination  with  the  first  dose  of  vaccine  (primary
vaccine failure). During 1989 through 1991, a major resurgence of measles occurred in
the United States. Approximately 55,000 cases and 120 measles-related deaths were
reported.  The  resurgence  was  characterized  by  an  increasing  proportion  of  cases
among  unvaccinated  preschool-aged  children,  particularly  among  those  residing  in
urban  areas  (40,41).  Efforts  to  increase  vaccination  coverage  among  preschool-aged
children  emphasized  vaccination  as  close  to  the  recommended  age  as  possible.  To
improve access to ACIP-recommended vaccines, the Vaccines for Children program, a
federally  funded  program  that  provides  vaccines  at  no  cost  to  eligible  persons  aged
<19  years,  was  initiated  in  1993  (42).  These  efforts,  combined  with  ongoing
implementation  of  the  2-dose  MMR  vaccine  recommendation,  reduced  reported
measles  cases  to  309  in  1995  (43).  During  1993,  both  epidemiologic  and  laboratory
evidence  suggested  that  transmission  of  indigenous  measles  had  been  interrupted  in
the United States (44,45). The recommended measles vaccination schedule changed as
knowledge of measles immunity increased and as the epidemiology of measles evolved
within the United States. The recommended age for vaccination was 9 months in 1963,
12  months  in  1965,  and  15  months  in  1967.  In  1989,  because  of  reported  measles
outbreaks  among  vaccinated  school-aged  children,  ACIP  and  AAFP  recommended  2
doses; with the first dose at age 15 months and the second dose at age 4 through 6

years,  before  school  entry.  In  contrast,  AAP  had  recommended  administration  of  the
second  dose  before  middle  school  entry  because  outbreaks  were  occurring  in  older
children,  and  to  help  reinforce  the  adolescent  doctor's  visit  and  counteract  possible
secondary vaccine failure (46). Since 1994, ages recommended by ACIP, AAFP, and AAP
have  been  the  same  for  the  2-dose  MMR  vaccine  schedule;  the  first  dose  should  be
given to children aged 12 through 15 months and the second dose should be given to
children  aged  4  through  6  years  (47).  Because  of  the  success  of  the  measles
vaccination program in achieving and maintaining high 1-dose MMR vaccine coverage
in preschool-aged children, high 2-dose MMR vaccine coverage in school-aged children,
and improved measles control in the World Health Organization (WHO) Region of the
Americas, measles was documented and verified as eliminated from the United States
in  2000  (48).  Elimination  is  defined  as  the  absence  of  endemic  transmission  (i.e.,
interruption  of  continuous  transmission  lasting  ≥12  months).  In  2002,  measles  was
declared  eliminated  from  the  WHO  Region  of  the  Americas  (49).   Documenting  and
verifying the interruption of endemic transmission of the measles and rubella viruses in
the  Americas  is  ongoing  in  accordance  with  the  Pan  American  Health  Organization
mandate of 2007 (http://www.paho.org/english/gov/csp/csp27.r2-e.pdf). An expert panel
reviewed  available  data  and  unanimously  agreed  in  December  2011  that  measles
elimination has been maintained in the United States (50,51). However, measles cases
associated with importation of the virus from other countries continue to occur. From
2001 through 2011, a median of 63 measles cases (range: 37–220) and four outbreaks,
defined  as  three  or  more  cases  linked  in  time  or  place  (range:  2–17),  were  reported
each  year  in  the  United  States.  Of  the  911  cases,  a  total  of  372  (41%)  cases  were
importations,  804  (88%)  were  associated  with  importations,  and  225  (25%)  involved
hospitalization. Two deaths were reported. Among the 162 cases reported from 2004
through 2008 among unvaccinated U.S. residents eligible for vaccination, a total of 110
(68%) were known to have occurred in persons who declined vaccination because of a

philosophical,  religious,  or  personal  objection  (52).  Rubella  (German  measles)  is
classified  as  a  Rubivirus  in  the  Togaviridae  family.  Rubella  is  an  illness  transmitted
through direct or droplet contact from nasopharyngeal secretions and is characterized
by rash, low-grade fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise. Symptoms are often mild and
up to 50% of rubella infections are subclinical (53,54). However, among adults infected
with  rubella,  transient  arthralgia  or  arthritis  occurs  frequently,  particularly  among
women (55). Other complications occur infrequently; thrombocytopenic purpura occurs
in approximately one out of 3,000 cases and is more likely to involve children (56), and
encephalitis  occurs  in  approximately  one  out  of  6,000  cases  and  is  more  likely  to
involve adults (57,58). Rubella infection in pregnant women, especially during the first
trimester, can result in miscarriages, stillbirths, and CRS, a constellation of birth defects
that  often  includes  cataracts,  hearing  loss,  mental  retardation,  and  congenital  heart
defects. In addition, infants with CRS frequently exhibit both intrauterine and postnatal
growth retardation. Infants who are moderately or severely affected by CRS are readily
recognizable at birth, but mild CRS (e.g., slight cardiac involvement or deafness) might
not  be  detected  for  months  or  years  after  birth  or  not  at  all.  The  risk  for  congenital
infection and defects is highest during the first 12 weeks of gestation (59–62), and the
risk for any defect decreases after the 12th week of gestation. Defects are rare when
infection occurs after the 20th week (63). Subclinical maternal rubella infection also can
cause congenital malformations. Fetal infection without clinical signs of CRS can occur
during  any  stage  of  pregnancy.  Rubella  reinfection  can  occur  and  has  been  reported
after  both  wild  type  rubella  infection  and  after  receiving  1  dose  of  rubella  vaccine.
Asymptomatic  maternal  reinfection  in  pregnancy  has  been  considered  to  present
minimal  risk  to  the  fetus  (congenital  infection  in  <10%)  (64),  but  several  isolated
reports have been made of fetal infection and CRS among infants born to mothers who
had documented serologic evidence of rubella immunity before they became pregnant
and  had  reinfection  during  the  first  12  weeks  of  gestation  (64–68).  CRS  was  not

reported when reinfection occurred after 12 weeks gestation (69–71). Before licensure
of live, attenuated rubella vaccines in the United States in 1969, rubella was common,
and epidemics occurred every 6 to 9 years (72). Most rubella cases were among young
children, with peak incidence among children aged 5 through 9 years (73). During the
1964 through 1965 rubella epidemic, an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases occurred
in  the  United  States,  resulting  in  approximately  2,000  cases  of  encephalitis,  11,250
fetal  deaths  attributable  to  spontaneous  or  therapeutic  abortions,  2,100  infants  who
were  stillborn  or  died  soon  after  birth,  and  20,000  infants  born  with  CRS  (74).  After
introduction  of  rubella  vaccines  in  the  United  States  in  1969,  reported  rubella  cases
declined 78%, from 57,686 in 1969 to 12,491 in 1976, and reported CRS cases declined
by 69%, from 68 in 1970 to 23 in 1976 (Figure 2) (73). Rubella incidence declined in all
age groups, but children aged <15 years experienced the greatest decline. Despite the
declines,  rubella  outbreaks  continued  to  occur  among  older  adolescents  and  young
adults and in settings where unvaccinated adults congregated. In 1977 and 1984, ACIP
modified  its  recommendations  to  include  vaccination  of  susceptible  postpubertal
females,  adolescents,  persons  in  military  service,  college  students,  and  persons  in
certain  work  settings  (75,76).  The  number  of  reported  rubella  cases  decreased  from
20,395 in 1977 to 225 in 1988, and CRS cases decreased from 29 in 1977 to 2 in 1988
(77). During 1989 through 1991, a resurgence of rubella occurred, primarily because of
outbreaks  among  unvaccinated  adolescents  and  young  adults  who  initially  were  not
recommended for vaccination and in religious communities with low rubella vaccination
coverage  (77).  As  a  result  of  the  rubella  outbreaks,  two  clusters  of  approximately  20
CRS  cases  occurred  (78,79).  Outbreaks  during  the  mid-1990s  occurred  in  settings
where young adults congregated and involved unvaccinated persons who belonged to
specific  racial/ethnic  groups  (80).  Further  declines  occurred  as  rubella  vaccination
efforts  increased  in  other  countries  in  the  WHO  Region  of  the  Americas.  From  2001
through 2004, reported rubella and CRS cases were at an all-time low, with an average

of 14 reported rubella cases a year, four CRS cases, and one rubella outbreak (defined
as three or more cases linked in time or place) (81). In 2004, a panel convened by CDC
reviewed  available  data  and  verified  elimination  of  rubella  in  the  United  States  (82).
Rubella  elimination  is  defined  as  the  absence  of  endemic  rubella  transmission  (i.e.,
continuous transmission lasting ≥12 months). From 2005 through 2011, a median of 11
rubella  cases  was  reported  each  year  in  the  United  States  (range:  4–18).  In  addition,
two  rubella  outbreaks  involving  three  cases,  as  well  as  four  total  CRS  cases,  were
reported. Among the 67 rubella cases reported from 2005 through 2011, a total of 28
(42%) cases were known importations (83; CDC, unpublished data, 2012). In 2010, on
the basis of surveillance data, the Pan American Health Organization indicated that the
WHO Region of the Americas had achieved the rubella and CRS elimination goals set in
2003 (84). Verification of maintenance of rubella elimination in the region is ongoing.
However,  an  expert  panel  reviewed  available  data  and  unanimously  agreed  in
December  2011  that  rubella  elimination  has  been  maintained  in  the  United  States
(50,51).  Mumps  virus  is  a  member  of  the  genus  Rubulavirus  in  the  Paramyxoviridae
family. Mumps is an acute viral infection characterized by fever and inflammation of the
salivary glands. Parotitis is the most common manifestation, with onset an average of
16 to 18 days after exposure (range: 12–25 days). In some studies, mumps symptoms
were  described  as  nonspecific  or  primarily  respiratory;  however,  these  reports  based
findings  on  serologic  results  taken  every  6  or  12  months,  making  it  difficult  to  prove
whether the respiratory tract symptoms were caused by mumps virus infection or if the
symptoms  happened  to  occur  at  the  same  time  as  the  mumps  infection  (85,86).  In
other  studies  conducted  during  the  prevaccine  era,  15%–27%  of  infections  were
described as asymptomatic (85,87,88). In the vaccine era, it is difficult to estimate the
number  of  asymptomatic  infections  because  the  way  vaccine  modifies  clinical
presentation  is  unclear  and  only  clinical  cases  with  parotitis,  other  salivary  gland
involvement, or mumps-related complications are notifiable. Serious complications can

occur in the absence of parotitis (89,90). Results from an outbreak from 2009 through
2010  indicated  that  complications  are  lower  in  vaccinated  patients  than  with
unvaccinated patients (6); however, during an outbreak in 2006, vaccination status was
not  significantly  associated  with  complications  (91).  Persons  with  mumps  are  most
infectious around the time of parotitis onset (92). Complications of mumps infection can
vary  with  age  and  sex.  In  the  prevaccine  era,  orchitis  was  reported  in  12%–66%  of
postpubertal males infected with mumps (93,94), compared with U.S. outbreaks in 2006
and 2009 through 2010 in the vaccine era, during which the range of rates of orchitis
among postpubertal males was 3%–10% (91,95,96). In 60%–83% of males with mumps
orchitis, only one testis is affected (87,90). Sterility from mumps orchitis, even bilateral
orchitis,  occurs  infrequently  (93).  In  the  prevaccine  era  among  postpubertal  women,
oophoritis  was  reported  in  approximately  5%  of  postpubertal  females  affected  with
mumps (97,98). Mastitis was included in case reports (99,100) but also was described
in a 1956–1957 outbreak as affecting 31% of postpubertal females (87). A significant
association between prepubescent mumps in females and infertility has been reported;
it has been suggested that oophoritis might have resulted in a disturbance of follicular
maturation  (101).  In  the  vaccine  era,  among  postpubertal  females,  the  range  of
oophoritis  rates  was  ≤1%  (91,95,96)  and  the  range  of  mastitis  rates  was  ≤1%
(91,95,96).  In  the  prevaccine  era,  pancreatitis  was  reported  in  4%  of  342  persons
infected with mumps in one community during a 2-year period (85) and was described
in  case  reports  (102,103).  Mumps  also  was  a  major  cause  of  hearing  loss  among
children in the prevaccine era, which could be sudden in onset, bilateral, or permanent
hearing  loss  (104–106).  In  the  prevaccine  era,  clinical  aseptic  meningitis  occurred  in
0.02%–10%  of  mumps  cases  and  typically  was  mild  (85,88,107–109).  However,  in
exceedingly  rare  cases,  mumps  meningoencephalitis  can  cause  permanent  sequelae,
including severe ataxia (110). The incidence of mumps encephalitis ranged from one in
6,000 mumps cases (0.02%) (107) to one in 300 mumps cases (0.3%) in the prevaccine

era (111). In the vaccine era, reported rates of pancreatitis, deafness, meningitis, and
encephalitis  were  all  <1%  (91,95,96).  The  average  annual  rate  of  hospitalization
resulting from mumps during World War I was 55.8 per 1,000, which was exceeded only
by  the  rates  for  influenza  and  gonorrhea  (112).  Mumps  was  a  major  cause  of  viral
encephalitis,  accounting  for  approximately  36%  of  encephalitis  cases  in  1967  (111).
Death from mumps is exceedingly rare and is primarily caused by mumps-associated
encephalitis (111). In the United States, from 1966 through 1971, two deaths occurred
per  10,000  reported  mumps  cases  (111).  Among  vaccinated  persons,  severe
complications of mumps are uncommon but occur more frequently among adults than
children. No mumps-related deaths were reported in the 2006 or the 2009–2010 U.S.
outbreaks (91,95,96). Among pregnant women with mumps during the first trimester,
an  increased  rate  of  spontaneous  abortion  or  intrauterine  fetal  death  has  been
observed  in  some  studies;  however,  no  evidence  indicates  that  mumps  causes  birth
defects  (87,113–116).  Before  the  introduction  of  vaccine  in  1967,  mumps  was  a
universal disease of childhood. Most children were infected by age 14 years, with peak
incidence  among  children  aged  5  through  9  years  (117,118).  Outbreaks  among  the
military  were  common,  especially  during  times  of  mobilization  (119,120).  Reported
cases  of  mumps  decreased  steadily  after  the  introduction  of  live  mumps  vaccine  in
1967  and  the  recommendation  in  1977  for  routine  vaccination  (Figure  3)  (121).
However, from 1986 through 1987, a resurgence of mumps occurred when a cohort not
targeted  for  vaccination  and  spared  from  natural  infection  by  declining  disease  rates
entered high school and college, resulting in 20,638 reported cases (122,123). By the
early 2000s, on average, fewer than 270 cases were reported annually; a decrease of
approximately 99% from the 152,209 cases reported in 1968, and seasonal peaks were
no  longer  present  (124).  In  2006,  an  outbreak  of  6,584  cases  occurred  and  was
centered  among  highly  2-dose  vaccinated  college  students  in  the  Midwestern  United
States (91). Children began receiving 2 doses of mumps vaccine after implementation

of a 2-dose measles vaccination policy using MMR vaccine in 1989 (39). Nonetheless,
ACIP specified in 2006 that all children and adults in certain high risk groups, including
students  at  post-high  school  educational  institutions,  health-care  personnel,  and
international travelers, should receive 2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine (3). From
2009  through  2010,  mumps  outbreaks  occurred  in  a  religious  community  in  the
Northeastern United States with approximately 3,500 cases and in the U.S. territory of
Guam with 505 cases reported. Similar to the 2006 mumps outbreak, most patients had
received  2  doses  of  MMR  vaccine  and  were  exposed  in  densely  congregate  settings
(88,94).  In  2011,  a  university  campus  in  California  reported  29  cases  of  mumps,  of
which 22 (76%) occurred among persons previously vaccinated with the recommended
2 doses of MMR vaccine (5). Two combination vaccines are licensed and available in the
United  States  to  prevent  measles,  rubella,  and  mumps:  trivalent  MMR  vaccine
(measles-mumps-rubella [M-M-R II, Merck & Co., Inc.]) and quadrivalent MMRV vaccine
(measles-mumps-rubella-varicella  [ProQuad,  Merck  &   Co.,  Inc.]).  The  efficacy  and
effectiveness of each component of the MMR vaccine is described below. MMRV vaccine
was licensed on the basis of noninferior immunogenicity of the antigenic components
compared  with  simultaneous  administration  of  MMR  vaccine  and  varicella  vaccine
(125). Formal studies to evaluate the clinical efficacy of MMRV vaccine have not been
performed;  efficacy  of  MMRV  vaccine  was  inferred  from  that  of  MMR  vaccine  and
varicella  vaccine  on  the  basis  of  noninferior  immunogenicity  (126).  Monovalent
measles, rubella, and mumps vaccines and other vaccine combinations are no longer
commercially  available  in  the  United  States.  The  measles  component  of  the
combination vaccines that are currently distributed in the United States was licensed in
1968  and  contains  the  live  Enders-Edmonston  (formerly  called  "Moraten")  vaccine
strain.  Enders-Edmonston  vaccine  strain  is  a  further  attenuated  preparation  of  a
previous  vaccine  strain  (Edmonston  B)  that  is  grown  in  chick  embryo  cell  culture.
Because of increased efficacy and fewer adverse reactions, the vaccine containing the

Enders-Edmonston  vaccine  strain  replaced  previous  vaccines:  inactivated  Edmonston
vaccine  (available  in  the  United  States  from  1963  through  1976),  live  attenuated
vaccines containing the Edmonston B (available in the United States from 1963 through
1975),  and  Schwarz  strain  (available  in  the  United  States  from  1965  through  1976).
Measles-containing vaccines produce a subclinical  or mild, noncommunicable infection
inducing both humoral and cellular immunity. Antibodies develop among approximately
96%  of  children  vaccinated  at  age  12  months  with  a  single  dose  of  the
Enders-Edmonston  vaccine  strain  (Table  1)  (127–134).  Almost  all  persons  who  do  not
respond to the measles component of the first dose of MMR vaccine at age ≥12 months
respond to the second dose (135,136). Data on early measles vaccination suggest that
infants vaccinated at age 6 months might have an age-related delay in maturation of
humoral  immune  response  to  measles  vaccine,  unrelated  to  passively  transferred
maternal antibody, compared with infants vaccinated at age 9 or 12 months (137,138).
However,  markers  of  cell-mediated  immune  response  to  measles  vaccine  were
equivalent  when  infants  were  vaccinated  at  age  6,  9,  and  12  months,  regardless  of
presence of passive antibodies (139). Although the cell-mediated immune response to
the  first  dose  of  measles  vaccine  alone  might  not  be  protective,  it  might  prime  the
humoral response to the second dose (140). Data indicate that revaccination of children
first  vaccinated  as  early  as  age  6  months  will  result  in  vaccine-induced  immunity,
although  the  response  might  be  associated  with  a  lower  antibody  titer  than  titers  of
children  vaccinated  at  age  9  or  12  months  (139).  One  dose  of  measles-containing
vaccine  administered  at  age  ≥12  months  was  approximately  94%  effective  in
preventing measles (range: 39%–98%) in studies conducted in the WHO Region of the
Americas (141,142). Measles outbreaks among populations that have received 2 doses
of  measles-containing  vaccine  are  uncommon.  The  effectiveness  of  2  doses  of
measles-containing  vaccine  was  ≥99%  in  two  studies  conducted  in  the  United  States
and  67%,  85%–≥94%,  and  100%  in  three  studies  in  Canada  (142–146).  The  range  in

2-dose  vaccine  effectiveness  in  the  Canadian  studies  can  be  attributed  to  extremely
small  numbers  (i.e.,  in  the  study  with  a  2-dose  vaccine  effectiveness  of  67%,  one
2-dose  vaccinated  person  with  measles  and  one  unvaccinated  person  with  measles
were  reported  [145]).  This  range  of  effectiveness  also  can  be  attributed  to  age  at
vaccination (i.e., the 85% vaccine effectiveness represented children vaccinated at age
12 months, whereas the ≥94% vaccine effectiveness represented children vaccinated
at  age  ≥15  months  [146]).  Furthermore,  two  studies  found  the  incremental
effectiveness
 of
 2
 doses
 was
 89%
 and
 94%,
 compared
 with
 1
 dose
 of
measles-containing vaccine (145,147). Similar estimates of vaccine effectiveness have
been  reported  from  Australia  and  Europe  (Table  1)  (141).  Both  serologic  and
epidemiologic  evidence  indicate  that  measles-containing  vaccines  induce  long  lasting
immunity in most persons (148). Approximately 95% of vaccinated persons examined
11 years after initial vaccination and 15 years after the second dose of MMR (containing
the Enders-Edmonston strain) vaccine had detectable antibodies to measles (149–152).
In one study among 25 age-appropriately vaccinated children aged 4 through 6 years
who had both low-level neutralizing antibodies and specific IgG antibodies by EIA before
revaccination with MMR vaccine, 21 (84%) developed an anamnestic immune response
upon revaccination; none developed IgM antibodies, indicating some level of immunity
persisted (153). The rubella component of the combination vaccines that are currently
distributed in the United States was licensed in 1979 and contains the live Wistar RA
27/3 vaccine strain. The vaccine is prepared in human diploid cell culture and replaced
previous  vaccines  (HPV-77  and  Cendehill)  because  it  induces  a  higher  and  more
persistent  antibody  response  and  is  associated  with  fewer  adverse  events  (154–158).
Rubella vaccination induces both humoral and cellular immunity. Approximately 95% of
susceptible  persons  aged  ≥12  months  developed  serologic  evidence  of  immunity  to
rubella after vaccination with a single dose of rubella vaccine containing the RA 27/3
strain (Table 1) (127,154,157–164). After a second dose of MMR vaccine, approximately

99% had detectable rubella antibody and approximately 60% had a fourfold increase in
titer (165–167). Outbreaks of rubella in populations vaccinated with the rubella RA 27/3
vaccine  strains  are  rare.  Available  studies  demonstrate  that  vaccines  containing  the
rubella  RA  27/3  strain  are  approximately  97%  effective  in  preventing  clinical  disease
after a single dose (range: 94%–100%) (Table 1) (168–170). Follow-up studies indicate
that  1  dose  of  rubella  vaccine  can  provide  long  lasting  immunity.  The  majority  of
persons  had  detectable  rubella  antibodies  up  to  16  years  after  1  dose  of
rubella-containing  vaccine,  but  antibody  levels  decreased  over  time  (165,171–174).
Although levels of vaccine-induced rubella antibodies might decrease over time, data
from  surveillance  of  rubella  and  CRS  suggest  that  waning  immunity  with  increased
susceptibility  to  rubella  disease  does  not  occur.  Among  persons  with  2  doses,
approximately 91%–100% had detectable antibodies 12 to 15 years after receiving the
second dose (150,165). The mumps component of the vaccine available in the United
States contains the live attenuated mumps Jeryl-Lynn vaccine strain. It was developed
using an isolate from a child with mumps and passaged in embryonated hens' eggs and
chick embryo cell cultures (175). The vaccine produces a subclinical, noncommunicable
infection with very few side effects. Approximately 94% of infants and children develop
detectable  mumps  antibodies  after  vaccination  with  MMR  vaccine  (range:  89%–97%)
(Table  1)  (127,157,176–184).  However,  vaccination  induces  relatively  low  levels  of
antibodies compared with natural infection (185,186). Among persons who received a
second  dose  of  MMR  vaccine,  most  mounted  a  secondary  immune  response,
approximately 50% had a fourfold increase in antibody titers, and the proportion with
low or undetectable titers was significantly reduced from 20% before vaccination with a
second  dose  to  4%  at  6  months  post  vaccination  (187–189).  Although  antibody
measurements are often used as a surrogate measure of immunity, no serologic tests
are available for mumps that consistently and reliably predict immunity. The immune
response  to  mumps  vaccination  probably  involves  both  the  humoral  and  cellular

immune  response,  but  no  definitive  correlates  of  protection  have  been  identified.
Clinical  studies  conducted  before  vaccine  licensure  in  approximately  7,000  children
found a single dose of mumps vaccine to be approximately 95% effective in preventing
mumps  disease  (186,190,191).  However,  vaccine  effectiveness  estimates  have  been
lower in postlicensure studies. In the United States, mumps vaccine effectiveness has
been  estimated  to  be  between  81%  and  91%  in  junior  high  and  high  school  settings
(192–197), and between 64% and 76% among household or close contacts for 1 dose of
mumps-containing  vaccine  (196,198).  Population  and  school-based  studies  conducted
in  Europe  and  Canada  report  comparable  estimates  for  vaccine  effectiveness
(49%–92%) (199–210). Fewer studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness
of  2  doses  of  mumps-containing  vaccine.  In  the  United  States,  outbreaks  among
populations with high 2-dose coverage found 2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine to
be  80%–92%  effective  in  preventing  clinical  disease  (198,211).  In  the  1988  through
1989 outbreak among junior high school students, the risk for mumps was five times
higher for students who received 1 dose compared with students who received 2 doses
(195). Population and school-based studies in Europe and Canada estimate 2 doses of
mumps-containing  vaccine  to  be  66%–95%  effective  (Table  1)  (201–204,208–210).
Despite  relatively  high  2-dose  vaccine  effectiveness,  high  2-dose  vaccine  coverage
might not be sufficient to prevent all outbreaks (6,91,212). Studies indicate that 1 dose
of MMR vaccine can provide persistent antibodies to mumps. The majority of persons
(70%–99%)  examined  approximately  10  years  after  initial  vaccination  had  detectable
mumps  antibodies  (187–189).  In  addition,  70%  of  adults  who  were  vaccinated  in
childhood  had  T-lymphocyte  immunity  to  mumps  compared  with  80%  of  adults  who
acquired  natural  infection  in  childhood  (213).  Similarly,  in  2-dose  recipients,  mumps
antibodies  were  detectable  in  the  majority  of  persons  (74%–95%)  followed  over  12
years after receipt of a second dose of MMR vaccine, but antibody levels declined with
time  (150,187).  Among  vaccine  recipients  who  do  not  have  detectable  mumps

antibodies, mumps antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses have been detected,
but their role in protection against mumps disease is not clear (214,215). For measles,
evidence of the effectiveness of MMR or measles vaccine administered as postexposure
prophylaxis  is  limited  and  mixed  (216–222).  Effectiveness  might  depend  on  timing  of
vaccination  and  the  nature  of  the  exposure.  If  administered  within  72  hours  of  initial
measles  exposure,  MMR  vaccine  might  provide  some  protection  against  infection  or
modify  the  clinical  course  of  disease  (216–219,222).  Several  published  studies  have
compared  attack  rates  among  persons  who  received  MMR  or  single  antigen  measles
vaccine  (without  gamma  globulin)  as  postexposure  prophylaxis  with  those  who
remained unvaccinated after exposure to measles. Postexposure prophylaxis with MMR
vaccine appears to be effective if the vaccine is administered within 3 days of exposure
to  measles  in  "limited"  contact  settings  (e.g.,  schools,  childcare,  and  medical  offices)
(218,222).  Postexposure  prophylaxis  does  not  appear  to  be  effective  in  settings  with
intense, prolonged, close contact, such as households and smaller childcare facilities,
even when the dose is administered within 72 hours of rash onset, because persons in
these settings are often exposed for long durations during the prodromal period when
the index patient is infectious (219–221). However, these household studies are limited
by number of persons receiving post-exposure prophylaxis (i.e., less than 10 persons
were given MMR vaccine as postexposure prophylaxis within 72 hours of rash onset in
each  of  the  cited  studies)  (219–221).  Revaccination  within  72  hours  of  exposure  of
those who have received 1 dose before exposure also might prevent disease (223). For
rubella and mumps, postexposure MMR vaccination has not been shown to prevent or
alter the clinical severity of disease. Data on use and effectiveness of a third dose of
MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control are limited. A study among a small number of
seronegative  college  students  who  had  2  documented  doses  of  MMR  vaccine
demonstrated  that  a  third  dose  of  MMR  vaccine  resulted  in  a  rapid  mumps  virus  IgG
response. Of 17 participants, a total of 14 (82%) were IgG positive at 7–10 days after

revaccination, suggesting that previously vaccinated persons administered a third dose
of MMR vaccine had the capacity to mount a rapid anamnestic immune response that
could possibly boost immunity to protective levels (224). In 2010, in collaboration with
local
 health
 departments,
 CDC
 conducted
 two
 Institutional
 Review
 Board
(IRB)-approved  studies  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  a  third  dose  of  MMR  vaccine  during
mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations in Orange County, New York (>94%
2-dose coverage among 2,688 students attending private school in grades 6 through12)
and Guam (≥95% 2-dose coverage among 3,364 students attending public primary and
middle  school  in  grades  4  through  8).  In  Orange  County,  New  York,  a  total  of  1,755
(81%)  eligible  students  in  grades  6  through  12  (ages  11  through  17  years)  in  three
schools received a third dose of MMR vaccine as part of the study (95). Overall attack
rates  declined  76%  in  the  village  after  the  intervention,  with  the  greatest  decline
among  those  aged  11  through  17  years  targeted  for  vaccination  (with  a  significant
decline  of  96%  postintervention  compared  with  preintervention).  The  96%  decline  in
attack rates in this age group was significantly greater than the declines in other age
groups that did not receive the third dose intervention (95). However, the intervention
was  conducted  after  the  outbreak  started  to  decline.  Because  of  the  high  rate  of
vaccine  uptake  and  small  number  of  cases  observed  in  the  22–42  days  after
vaccination,  the  study  could  not  directly  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  a  third  dose.
During  a mumps outbreak in Guam in 2010, a total of 3,239 eligible children aged  9
through 14 years in seven schools were offered a third dose of MMR vaccine (96). Of
the eligible children, 1,067 (33%) received a third dose of MMR vaccine. More than one
incubation period after the third dose intervention, students who had 3 doses of MMR
vaccine  had  a  2.6-fold  lower  mumps  attack  rate  compared  with  students  who  had  2
doses of MMR vaccine (0.9 per 1,000 versus 2.4 per 1,000), but the difference was not
statistically  significant  (Relative  Risk  [RR]  =  0.40,  95%  Confidence  interval  [CI]  =
0.05–3.4,  p  =  0.67).  The  intervention  was  conducted  after  the  outbreak  started  to

decline and during the week before the end of the school year, which limited the ability
to evaluate effectiveness of the intervention. Data are insufficient to recommend for or
against the use of a third dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control. CDC has
issued guidance for consideration for use of a third dose in specifically identified target
populations  along  with  criteria  for  public  health  departments  to  consider  for  decision
making  (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt09-mumps.html).  Before
the  availability  of  effective  ART,  responses  to  MMR  vaccine  among  persons  with  HIV
infection were suboptimal. Although response to revaccination varied, it generally was
poor  (225,226).  In  addition,  measles  antibodies  appear  to  decline  more  rapidly  in
children with HIV infection than in children without HIV infection (227,228). Memory B
cell counts and function appear to be normal in HIV-infected children who are started
on  effective  ART  early  (aged  <1  year),  and  responses  to  measles  and  rubella
vaccination appear to be adequate. Measles antibody titers were higher in HIV-infected
children  who  started  effective  ART  early  compared  with  HIV-infected  children  who
started effective ART later in life (229). Likewise, vaccinated HIV-infected children who
initiated  effective  ART  before  vaccination  had  rubella  antibody  responses  similar  to
those  observed  in  HIV-uninfected  children  (230).  Despite  evidence  of  immune
reconstitution, effective ART does not appear to reliably restore immunity from previous
vaccinations. Perinatally HIV-infected youth who received MMR vaccine before effective
ART might have increased susceptibility to measles, mumps, and rubella compared with
HIV-exposed but uninfected persons. Approximately 45%–65% of previously vaccinated
HIV-infected children had detectable antibodies to measles after initiation of effective
ART,  55%–80%  had  detectable  antibodies  to  rubella,  and  52%–59%  had  detectable
antibodies  to  mumps  (231–235).  However,  revaccination  with  MMR  vaccine  after
initiation  of  effective  ART  increased  the  proportion  of  HIV-infected  children  with
detectable  antibodies  to  measles,  rubella,  and  mumps  (64%–90%  for  measles,
80%–100%  for  rubella,  and  78%  for  mumps)  (230,234,236–240).  Although,  data  on

duration  of  response  to  revaccination  on  effective  ART  are  limited,  the  majority  of
children had detectable antibodies to measles (73%–85%), rubella (79%), and mumps
(61%)  1–4  years  after  revaccination  (234,238,240).  The  lyophilized  live  MMR  vaccine
and MMRV vaccine should be reconstituted and administered as recommended by the
manufacturer  (241,242).  Both  vaccines  available  in  the  United  States  should  be
administered  subcutaneously.  Although  both  vaccines  must  be  protected  from  light,
which  might  inactivate  the  vaccine  viruses,  the  two  vaccines  have  different  storage
requirements  (Table  2).  Administration  of  improperly  stored  vaccine  might  fail  to
provide protection against disease. The diluent can be stored in the refrigerator or at
room  temperature  but  should  not  be  allowed  to  freeze.  MMR  vaccine  is  supplied  in
lyophilized  form  and  must  be  stored  at  −50°C  to  8°C  (−58°F  to  46°F)  and  protected
from light at all times. The vaccine in the lyophilized form can be stored in the freezer.
Reconstituted MMR vaccine should be used immediately or stored in a dark place at 2°C
to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 8 hours and should not be frozen or exposed to freezing
temperatures (241). MMRV vaccine is supplied in a lyophilized frozen form that should
be stored at −50°C to -15°C (−58°F to 5°F) in a reliable freezer. Reconstituted vaccine
can  be  stored  at  room  temperature  between  20°C  to  25°C  (68°F  to  77°F),  protected
from light for up to 30 minutes. Reconstituted MMRV vaccine must be discarded if not
used within 30 minutes and should not be frozen (242). Before administering MMR or
MMRV vaccine, providers should consult the package insert for precautions, warnings,
and contraindications (241,242). Contraindications for MMR and MMRV vaccines include
history of anaphylactic reactions to neomycin, history of severe allergic reaction to any
component of the vaccine, pregnancy, and immunosuppression. History of anaphylactic
reactions  to  neomycin.  MMR  and  MMRV  vaccine  contain  trace  amounts  of  neomycin;
therefore,  persons  who  have  experienced  anaphylactic  reactions  to  topically  or
systemically  administered  neomycin  should  not  receive  these  vaccines.  However,
neomycin  allergy  usually  manifests  as  a  delayed  type  or  cell-mediated  immune

response (i.e., a contact dermatitis) rather than as anaphylaxis. In persons who have
such  sensitivity,  the  adverse  reaction  to  the  neomycin  in  the  vaccine  is  an
erythematous, pruritic nodule or papule appearing 48–72 hours after vaccination (243).
A  history  of  contact  dermatitis  to  neomycin  is  not  a  contraindication  to  receiving
MMR-containing  vaccine.  History  of  severe  allergic  reaction  to  any  component  of  the
vaccine.  MMR  and  MMRV  vaccine  should  not  be  administered  to  persons  who  have
experienced severe allergic reactions to a previous dose of measles-, mumps-, rubella-,
or varicella (for MMRV vaccine)-containing vaccine or to a vaccine component. Although
measles and mumps components of the vaccine are grown in chick embryo fibroblast
tissue culture, allergy to egg is not a contraindication to vaccination. Among persons
who are allergic to eggs, the risk for serious allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis after
administration of MMR vaccine, is exceedingly low (i.e., at least 99% of children with
challenge-proved  egg  allergy  can  receive  this  vaccine  in  one  subcutaneous  dose
without  severe  anaphylactic  reactions  [CI  =  99%–100%])  (244).  Skin  testing  with
vaccine is not predictive of allergic reaction to vaccination (244–246). Therefore, skin
testing is not required before administering MMR or MMRV vaccines to persons who are
allergic to eggs. The rare serious allergic reactions after measles or mumps vaccination
or  MMR  vaccination  are  not  believed  to  be  caused  by  egg  antigens,  but  by  other
components  of  the  vaccine  (247–249)  Pregnancy.  MMR  vaccines  should  not  be
administered  to  women  known  to  be  pregnant  or  attempting  to  become  pregnant.
Because  of  the  theoretical  risk  to  the  fetus  when  the  mother  receives  a  live  virus
vaccine,  women  should  be  counseled  to  avoid  becoming  pregnant  for  28  days  after
receipt of MMR vaccine (2). If the vaccine is inadvertently administered to a pregnant
woman or a pregnancy occurs within 28 days of vaccination, she should be counseled
about the theoretical risk to the fetus. The theoretical maximum risk for CRS after the
administration  of  rubella  RA  27/3  vaccine  on  the  basis  of  the  95%  CI  of  the  binomial
distribution  with  144  observations  in  one  study  was  estimated  to  be  2.6%,  and  the

observed risk was 0% (250). Other reports have documented no cases of CRS among
approximately  1,000  live-born  infants  of  susceptible  women  who  were  vaccinated
inadvertently with the rubella RA 27/3 vaccine while pregnant or just before conception
(251–257). Of these, approximately 100 women were known to be vaccinated within 1
week  before  to  4  weeks  after  conception  (251,252),  the  period  presumed  to  be  the
highest risk for viremia and fetal malformations. These figures are considerably lower
than the ≥20% risk associated with wild rubella virus infection of mothers during the
first  trimester  of  pregnancy  with  wild  rubella  virus  or  the  risk  for  non-CRS-induced
congenital defects in pregnancy (250). Thus, MMR vaccination during pregnancy should
not  be  considered  an  indication  for  termination  of  pregnancy.  MMR  vaccine  can  be
administered  safely  to  children  or  other  persons  without  evidence  of  immunity  to
measles, mumps, or rubella and who have pregnant household contacts to help protect
these pregnant women from exposure to wild rubella virus. No reports of transmission
of  measles  or  mumps  vaccine  virus  exist  from  vaccine  recipients  to  susceptible
contacts; although small amounts of rubella vaccine virus are detected in the noses or
throats  of  most  rubella  susceptible  persons  7  to  28  days  post-vaccination,  no
documented  confirmed  cases  of  transmission  of  rubella  vaccine  virus  have  been
reported. Immunosuppression. MMR and MMRV vaccine should not be administered to
1)  persons  with  primary  or  acquired  immunodeficiency,  including  persons  with
immunosuppression
 associated
 with
 cellular
 immunodeficiencies,
hypogammaglobulinemia,
 dysgammaglobulinemia
 and
 AIDS
 or
 severe
immunosuppression  associated  with  HIV  infection;  2)  persons  with  blood  dyscrasias,
leukemia,  lymphomas  of  any  type,  or  other  malignant  neoplasms  affecting  the  bone
marrow  or  lymphatic  system;  3)  persons  who  have  a  family  history  of  congenital  or
hereditary immunodeficiency in first-degree relatives (e.g., parents and siblings), unless
the  immune  competence  of  the  potential  vaccine  recipient  has  been  substantiated
clinically
 or
 verified
 by
 a
 laboratory;
 or
 4)
 persons
 receiving
 systemic

immunosuppressive therapy, including corticosteroids ≥2 mg/kg of body weight or ≥20
mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for persons who weigh >10 kg, when administered
for  ≥2  weeks  (258).  Persons  with  HIV  infection  who  do  not  have  severe
immunosuppression  should  receive  MMR  vaccine,  but  not  MMRV  vaccine  (see
subsection  titled  Persons  with  HIV  Infection).  Measles  inclusion  body  encephalitis  has
been reported after administration of MMR vaccine to immunosuppressed persons, as
well as after natural measles infection with wild type virus (see section titled Safety of
MMR and MMRV Vaccines) (259–261). Precautions for MMR and MMRV vaccines include
recent  (≤11  months)  receipt  of  an  antibody-containing  blood  product,  concurrent
moderate  or  severe  illness  with  or  without  fever,  history  of  thrombocytopenia  or
thrombocytopenic  purpura,  and  tuberculin  skin  testing.  If  a  tuberculin  test  is  to  be
performed, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with, or at
least 4–6 weeks after administration of MMR or MMRV vaccine. An additional precaution
for MMRV vaccine includes persons with a personal or family history of seizures of any
etiology. Recent (≤11 months) receipt of antibody-containing blood product. Receipt of
antibody-containing  blood  products  (e.g.,  IG,  whole  blood,  or  packed  red  blood  cells)
might interfere with the serologic response to measles and rubella vaccine for variable
periods,  depending  on  the  dose  of  IG  administered  (262).  The  effect  of  IG-containing
preparations on the response to mumps vaccine is unknown. MMR vaccine should be
administered  to  persons  who  have  received  an  IG  preparation  only  after  the
recommended  intervals  have  elapsed  (258).  However,  postpartum  administration  of
MMR vaccine to women who lack presumptive evidence of immunity to rubella should
not  be  delayed  because  anti-Rho(D)  IG  (human)  or  any  other  blood  product  were
received during the last trimester of pregnancy or at delivery. These women should be
vaccinated immediately after delivery and tested at least 3 months later to ensure that
they  have  presumptive  evidence  of  immunity  to  rubella  and  measles.  Moderate  or
severe illness with or without fever. Vaccination of persons with concurrent moderate or

severe  illness,  including  untreated,  active  tuberculosis,  should  be  deferred  until  they
have  recovered.  This  precaution  avoids  superimposing  any  adverse  effects  of  the
vaccine  on  the  underlying  illness  or  mistakenly  attributing  a  manifestation  of  the
underlying  illness  to  the  vaccine.  The  decision  to  vaccinate  or  postpone  vaccination
depends largely on the cause of the illness and the severity of symptoms. MMR vaccine
can be administered to children who have mild illness, with or without low-grade fever,
including  mild  upper  respiratory  infections,  diarrhea,  and  otitis  media.  Data  indicate
that  seroconversion  is  not  affected  by  concurrent  or  recent  mild  illness  (263–265).
Physicians should be alert to the vaccine-associated temperature elevations that might
occur predominately in the second week after vaccination, especially with the first dose
of  MMRV  vaccine.  Persons  being  treated  for  tuberculosis  have  not  experienced
exacerbations of the disease when vaccinated with MMR vaccine. Although no studies
have been reported concerning the effect of MMR or MMRV vaccines on persons with
untreated  tuberculosis,  a  theoretical  basis  exists  for  concern  that  measles  vaccine
might  exacerbate  tuberculosis.  Consequently,  before  administering  MMR  vaccine  to
persons  with  untreated  active  tuberculosis,  initiating  antituberculous  therapy  is
advisable.  Testing  for  latent  tuberculosis  infection  is  not  a  prerequisite  for  routine
vaccination  with  MMR  vaccine.  History  of  thrombocytopenia  or  thrombocytopenic
purpura. Persons who have a history of thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopenic purpura
might be at increased risk for developing clinically significant thrombocytopenia after
MMR  or  MMRV  vaccination.  Persons  with  a  history  of  thrombocytopenia  have
experienced  recurrences  after  MMR  vaccination  (266,267),  whereas  others  have  not
had  a  repeat  episode  after  MMR  vaccination  (268–270).  In  addition,  persons  who
developed  thrombocytopenia  with  a  previous  dose  might  develop  thrombocytopenia
with a subsequent dose of MMR vaccine (271,272). However, among 33 children who
were admitted for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura before receipt of a second dose
of  MMR  vaccine,  none  had  a  recurrence  within  6  weeks  of  the  second  MMR  vaccine

(273). Serologic evidence of immunity can be sought to determine whether or not an
additional dose of MMR or MMRV vaccine is needed. Tuberculin testing. MMR vaccine
might  interfere  with  the  response  to  a  tuberculin  skin  test,  resulting  in  a  temporary
depression of tuberculin skin sensitivity (274–276). Therefore, if a tuberculin skin test is
to be performed, it should be administered either any time before, simultaneously with,
or at least 4–6 weeks after MMR or MMRV vaccine. As with the tuberculin skin tests, live
virus  vaccines  also  might  affect  tuberculosis  interferon-gamma  release  assay  (IGRAs)
test results. However, the effect of live virus vaccination on IGRAs has not been studied.
Until additional information is available, IGRA testing in the context of live virus vaccine
administration  should  be  done  either  on  the  same  day  as  vaccination  with  live-virus
vaccine  or  4–6  weeks  after  the  administration  of  the  live-virus  vaccine.  Personal  or
family history of seizures of any etiology. A personal or family (i.e., sibling or parent)
history  of  seizures  of  any  etiology  is  a  precaution  for  the  first  dose  of  MMRV  but  not
MMR vaccination. Studies suggest that children who have a personal or family history of
febrile  seizures  or  family  history  of  epilepsy  are  at  increased  risk  for  febrile  seizures
compared  with  children  without  such  histories.  In  one  study,  the  risk  difference  of
febrile  seizure  within  14  days  of  MMR  vaccination  for  children  aged  15  to  17  months
with a personal history of febrile seizures was 19.5 per 1,000 (CI = 16.1– 23.6) and for
siblings of children with a history of febrile seizures was four per 1,000 (CI = 2.9–5.4)
compared  with  unvaccinated  children  of  the  same  age  (277).  In  another  study,  the
match adjusted odds ratio for children with a family history of febrile seizures was 4.8
(CI  =  1.3–18.6)  compared  with  children  without  a  family  history  of  febrile  seizures
(278). For the first dose of measles vaccine, children with a personal or family history of
seizures of any etiology generally should be vaccinated with MMR vaccine because the
risks for using MMRV vaccine in this group of children generally outweigh the benefits.
MMR  vaccine  generally  is  well-tolerated  and  rarely  associated  with  serious  adverse
events.  MMR  vaccine  might  cause  fever  (<15%),  transient  rashes  (5%),  transient

lymphadenopathy  (5%  of  children  and  20%  of  adults),  or  parotitis  (<1%)
(160,163,279–283).  Febrile  reactions  usually  occur  7–12  days  after  vaccination  and
generally  last  1–2  days  (280).  The  majority  of  persons  with  fever  are  otherwise
asymptomatic.  Four  adverse  events  (i.e.,  coryza,  cough,  pharyngitis,  and  headache)
after  revaccination  were  found  to  be  significantly  lower  with  a  second  dose  of  MMR
vaccine,
 and
 six
 adverse
 events
 (i.e.,
 conjunctivitis,
 nausea,
 vomiting,
lymphadenopathy,  joint  pain,  and  swollen  jaw)  had  no  significant  change  compared
with  the  prevaccination  baseline  in  school-aged  children  (284).  Expert  committees  at
the  Institute  of  Medicine  (IOM)  reviewed  evidence  concerning  the  causal  relation
between MMR vaccination and various adverse events (285–289). Their causality was
assessed on the basis of epidemiologic evidence derived from studies of populations, as
well  as  mechanistic  evidence  derived  primarily  from  biologic  and  clinical  studies  in
animals and humans; risk was not quantified. IOM determined that evidence supports a
causal
 relation
 between
 MMR
 vaccination
 and
 anaphylaxis,
 febrile
 seizures,
thrombocytopenic
 purpura,
 transient
 arthralgia,
 and
 measles
 inclusion
 body
encephalitis
 in
 persons
 with
 demonstrated
 immunodeficiencies.
 Anaphylaxis.
Immediate anaphylactic reactions after MMR vaccination are rare (1.8–14.4 per million
doses)  (290–293).  Although  measles-  and  mumps-containing  vaccines  are  grown  in
tissue from chick embryos, the rare serious allergic reactions after MMR vaccination are
not  believed  to  be  caused  by  egg  antigens  but  by  other  components  of  the  vaccine,
such as gelatin or neomycin (247–249). Febrile seizures. MMR vaccination might cause
febrile seizures. The risk for such seizures is approximately one case for every 3,000 to
4,000 doses of MMR vaccine administered (294,295). Children with a personal or family
history  of  febrile  seizures  or  family  history  of  epilepsy  might  be  at  increased  risk  for
febrile  seizures  after  MMR  vaccination  (277,278).  The  febrile  seizures  typically  occur
6–14  days  after  vaccination  and  do  not  appear  to  be  associated  with  any  long-term
sequelae  (294–297).  An  approximate  twofold  increased  risk  exists  for  febrile  seizures

among  children  aged  12  to  23  months  who  received  the  first  dose  of  MMRV  vaccine
compared  with  children  who  received  MMR  and  varicella  vaccines  separately.  One
additional  febrile  seizure  occurred  5  through  12  days  after  vaccination  per  2,300  to
2,600  children  who  received  the  first  dose  of  MMRV  vaccine  compared  with  children
who received the first dose of MMR and varicella vaccine separately but at the same
visit  (298,299).  No  increased  risk  for  febrile  seizures  was  observed  after  vaccination
with MMRV vaccine in children aged 4 through 6 years (300). For additional details, see
ACIP
 recommendations
 on
 the
 use
 of
 combination
 MMRV
 vaccine
 (126).
Thrombocytopenic  purpura.  Immune  thrombocytopenic  purpura  (ITP),  a  disorder
affecting blood platelet count, might be idiopathic or associated with a number of viral
infections. ITP after receipt of live attenuated measles vaccine and wild type measles
infections is usually self-limited and not life threatening; however, complications of ITP
might  include  severe  bleeding  requiring  blood  transfusion  (267,268,270).  The  risk  for
ITP increases during the 6 weeks after MMR vaccination, with one study estimating one
case per 40,000 doses (270). The risk for thrombocytopenia after MMR vaccination is
much less than after natural infection with rubella (one case per 3,000 infections) (56).
On  the  basis  of  case  reports,  the  risk  for  MMR  vaccine-associated  thrombocytopenia
might  be  increased  for  persons  who  previously  have  had  ITP  (see  Precautions).
Arthralgia and arthritis. Joint symptoms are associated with the rubella component of
MMR  vaccine  (301).  Among  persons  without  rubella  immunity  who  receive
rubella-containing  vaccine,  arthralgia  and  transient  arthritis  occur  more  frequently
among  adults  than  children,  and  more  frequently  among  postpubertal  females  than
males (302,303). Acute arthralgia or arthritis are rare among children who receive RA
27/3 vaccine (160,303). In contrast, arthralgia develops among approximately 25% of
nonimmune  postpubertal  females  after  vaccination  with  rubella  RA  27/3  vaccine,  and
approximately
 10%
 to
 30%
 have
 acute
 arthritis-like
 signs
 and
 symptoms
(154,160,282,301). Arthralgia or arthritis generally begin 1–3 weeks after vaccination,

usually  are  mild  and  not  incapacitating,  lasts  about  2  days,  and  rarely  recur
(160,301,303,304).  Measles  inclusion  body  encephalitis.  Measles  inclusion  body
encephalitis  is  a  complication  of  measles  infection  that  occurs  in  young  persons  with
defective  cellular  immunity  from  either  congenital  or  acquired  causes.  The
complications develop within 1 year after initial measles infection and the mortality rate
is high. Three published reports in persons with immune deficiencies described measles
inclusion  body  encephalitis  after  measles  vaccination,  documented  by  intranuclear
inclusions  corresponding  to  measles  virus  or  the  isolation  of  measles  virus  from  the
brain  among  vaccinated  persons  (259–261,289).  The  time  from  vaccination  to
development of measles inclusion body encephalitis for these cases was 4–9 months,
consistent with development of measles inclusion body encephalitis after infection with
wild measles virus (305). In one case, the measles vaccine strain was identified (260).
Other  possible  adverse  events.  IOM  concluded  that  the  body  of  evidence  favors
rejection of a causal association between MMR vaccine and risk for autistic spectrum
disorders  (ASD),  including  autism,  inflammatory  bowel  diseases,  and  type  1  diabetes
mellitus.  In  addition,  the  available  evidence  was  not  adequate  to  accept  or  reject  a
causal relation between MMR vaccine and the following conditions: acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis,  afebrile  seizures,  brachial  neuritis,  chronic  arthralgia,  chronic
arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic inflammatory disseminated polyneuropathy,
encephalopathy,  fibromyalgia,  Guillain-Barré  syndrome,  hearing  loss,  hepatitis,
meningitis,  multiple  sclerosis,  neuromyelitis  optica,  optic  neuritis,  transverse  myelitis,
opsoclonus
 myoclonus
 syndrome,
 or  radiculoneuritis
 and
 other  neuropathies.
Short-term  safety  of  administration  of  a  third  dose  of  MMR  vaccine  was  evaluated
following vaccination clinics during two mumps outbreaks among 2,130 persons aged 9
through 21 years (96,306). Although these studies did not include a control group, few
adverse events were reported after administration of a third dose of MMR vaccine (7%
in Orange County, New York and 6% in Guam). The most commonly reported adverse

events  were  pain,  redness,  or  swelling  at  the  injection  site  (2%–4%);  joint  or  muscle
aches (2%–3%); and dizziness or lightheadedness (2%). No serious adverse events were
reported  in  either  study.  HIV-infected  persons  are  at  increased  risk  for  severe
complications  if  infected  with  measles  (16,307–310),  and  several  severe  and  fatal
measles cases have been reported in HIV-infected children after vaccination, including
progressive  measles  pneumonitis  in  a  person  with  HIV  infection  and  severe
immunosuppression who received MMR vaccine (311), and several deaths after measles
vaccination among persons with severe immunosuppression unrelated to HIV infection
(312–314).  No  serious  or  unusual  adverse  events  have  been  reported  after  measles
vaccination  among  persons  with  HIV  infection  who  did  not  have  evidence  of  severe
immunosuppression  (315–320).  Severe  immunosuppression  is  defined  as  CD4+
T-lymphocyte percentages <15% at any age or CD4 count <200 lymphocytes/mm3 for
persons aged >5 years (321,322). Furthermore, no serious adverse events have been
reported in several studies in which MMR vaccine was administered to a small number
of children on ART with histories of immunosuppression (231,233,238). MMR vaccine is
not  recommended  for  persons  with  HIV  infection  who  have  evidence  of  severe
immunosuppression, and MMRV vaccine is not approved for use in any persons with HIV
infection.  Clinically  significant  adverse  events  that  arise  after  vaccination  should  be
reported
 to
 the
 Vaccine
 Adverse
 Event
 Reporting
 System
 (VAERS)
 at
http://vaers.hhs.gov/esub/index. VAERS is a postmarketing safety surveillance program
that collects information about adverse events (possible side effects) that occur after
the  administration  of  vaccines  licensed  for  use  in  the  United  States.   Reports  can  be
filed  securely  online,  by  mail,  or  by  fax.  A  VAERS  form  can  be  downloaded  from  the
VAERS website or requested by e-mail (info@vaers.org), telephone (800-822-7967), or
fax (877-721-0366). Additional information on VAERS or vaccine safety is available at
http://vaers.hhs.gov/about/index  or  by  calling  telephone  800-822-7967.  The  National
Vaccine  Injury  Compensation  Program  (VICP),  established  by  the  National  Childhood

Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986, as amended, provides a mechanism through which
compensation can be paid on behalf of a person determined to have been injured or to
have  died  as  a  result  of  receiving  a  vaccine  covered  by  VICP  (323).  NCVIA  requires
health-care  providers  to  report  any  adverse  events  listed  by  the  manufacturer  as  a
contraindication to further vaccine or any adverse event listed in the VAERS Table of
Reportable  Events  Following  Vaccination  that  occurs  within  the  specified  time  period
after vaccination (324). The Vaccine Injury Table lists the vaccines covered by VICP and
the injuries and conditions (including death) for which compensation might be paid. If
the injury or condition is not included in the table, or does not occur within the specified
time  period  on  the  table,  persons  must  prove  that  the  vaccine  caused  the  injury  or
condition. For a person to be eligible for compensation, the general filing deadlines for
injuries require claims to be filed within 3 years after the first symptom of the vaccine
injury; for a death, claims must be filed within 2 years of the vaccine-related death and
not more than 4 years after the start of the first symptom of the vaccine-related injury
from which the death occurred. When a new vaccine is covered by VICP or when a new
injury/condition  is  added  to  the  table,  claims  that  do  not  meet  the  general  filing
deadlines must be filed within 2 years from the date the vaccine or injury/condition is
added to the table for injuries or deaths that occurred up to 8 years before the table
change. Persons who receive a VICP-covered vaccine might be eligible to file a claim.

Human  immune  globulin  (IG)  is  a  blood  product  used  to  provide  antibodies  for
short-term  prevention  of  infectious  diseases,  including  measles.  IG  products  are
prepared  from  plasma  pools  derived  from  thousands  of  donors.  Persons  who  have
measles disease typically have higher measles antibody titers than persons who have
vaccine-induced measles immunity. Although the prevalence of measles antibodies is
high  in  the  U.S.  population  (325),  potency  of  IG  products  has  declined  as  a  result  of

change  in  the  donor  population  from  persons  with  immunity  from  disease  to  persons
with predominately vaccine-induced measles immunity (326). Multiple IG preparations
are available in the United States and include IG administered intramuscularly (IGIM),
intravenously  (IGIV),  and  subcutaneously  (IGSC).  The  minimum  measles  antibody
potency  requirement  for  IGIM  used  in  the  United  States  is  0.60  of  the  reference
standard (U.S. Reference IG, Lot 176) and 0.48 of the reference standard for IGIV and
IGSC.  In  2007,  the  FDA  Blood  Products  Advisory  Committee  lowered  the  measles
antibody  concentration  requirements  for  IGIV  and  IGSC  from  0.60  to  0.48  of  the
reference standard when testing and calculations indicated that IGIV and IGSC products
with  this  minimum  potency  could  be  expected  to  provide  a  measles  antibody
concentration of ≥120 mIU/mL, the estimated protective level of measles neutralizing
antibody  (327),  for  28–30  days,  if  administered  at  the  minimum  label  recommended
dose  of  200  mg/kg  (328).  Historically,  IGIM  has  been  the  blood  product  of  choice  for
short-term measles prophylaxis and was the product used to demonstrate efficacy for
measles postexposure prophylaxis (329). The recommended dose of IGIM is 0.5mL/kg.
Because  concentrations  of  antibodies  are  lower,  an  increase  in  dose  is  needed.
However, postexposure use of IGIM might be limited because of volume limitations. The
maximum dose by volume is 15 mL. Persons who weigh >30 kg will receive less than
the recommended dose and will have lower titers than recommended. IGIV has been
available  since  1981  and  is  used  primarily  for  the  prevention  of  common  infectious
diseases for patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders. Although a larger dose
can be administered with IGIV compared with IGIM, clinical use of IGIV has important
disadvantages, including high cost and administration requiring extended observation
in  specialized  settings  by  skilled  professionals  (i.e.,  hospital  setting).  IGSC  has  been
available since 2006 with the same major indication as IGIV. However, administration
requires a pump and advanced training. Also, multiple, consecutive weekly doses are
needed  to  establish  a  steady-state  with  protective  antibody  levels.  Additional

nsedProductsBLAs/FractionatedPlasmaProducts/ucm127589.htm.  One  IGIM  product  is
licensed  and  available  in  the  United  States,  and  the  package  insert  is  available  at
http://www.talecris-pi.info/inserts/gamastans-d.pdf. IGIM has been used as prophylaxis
to  prevent  or  attenuate  measles  disease  since  the  1940s,  when  it  was  demonstrated
that  IGIM  can  reduce  the  risk  for  measles  or  modify  disease  if  administered  within  6
days of exposure (329,330) with a dose response effect (331). However, postexposure
IGIM was not effective in a study conducted in 1990 (220). Although the optimal dose of
IGIM needed to provide protection against measles infection after exposure is unknown,
a  study  from  1999  through  2000  indicated  a  titer-dependent  effect,  with  higher
antimeasles titer providing the greatest protection (332). Children who did not develop
disease  received  a  mean  dose  of  10.9  IU/kg  compared  with  5.7  IU/kg  for  children  in
which  postexposure  prophylaxis  with  IGIM  failed.  Infants  typically  are  protected  from
measles  at  birth  by  passively  acquired  maternal  antibodies.  The  duration  of  this
protection depends largely on the amount of antibody transferred, which is related to
gestational  age  and  maternal  antibody  titer  (333).  Women  with  vaccine-derived
measles immunity have lower antibody titers and transfer shorter term protection than
women  who  have  had  measles  disease  (333–335).  Although  foreign-born  mothers
accounted  for  23%  of  all  births  in  2010  and  most  of  these  mothers  born  outside  the
Western  Hemisphere  likely  had  immunity  from  wild  measles  (336),  the  majority  of
women  of  childbearing  age  in  the  United  States  now  have  vaccine-derived  measles
immunity. Fewer opportunities exist for boosting this immunity by exposure to wild type
viruses.  Thus,  infants  born  now  are  more  likely  to  be  susceptible  to  measles  at  a
younger  age  (337).  Seroepidemiologic  studies  indicate  that  7%  of  infants  born  in  the
United States might lack antimeasles antibodies at birth and up to 90% of infants might
be  seronegative  by  age  6  months  (139,325).  These  data  suggest  a  change  in  the

window of vulnerability for measles infection during infancy, a strong need to preserve
herd  protection,  vigilance  for  imported  cases,  and  rapid  access  to  IG  products  when
postexposure  prophylaxis  is  needed.  The  criteria  for  acceptable  evidence  of  measles,
rubella,  and  mumps  immunity  were  developed  to  guide  vaccination  assessment  and
administration in clinical and public health settings and to provide presumptive rather
than  absolute  evidence  of  immunity.  Persons  who  meet  the  criteria  for  acceptable
evidence of immunity have a very high likelihood of immunity. Occasionally, a person
who  meets  the  criteria  for  presumptive  immunity  can  acquire  and  transmit  disease.
Specific  criteria  for  documentation  of  immunity  have  been  established  for  measles,
rubella, and mumps (Table 3). These criteria apply only to routine vaccination. During
outbreaks, recommended criteria for presumptive evidence of immunity might differ for
some  groups  (see  section  titled  Recommendations  during  Outbreaks  of  Measles,
Rubella,  or  Mumps).  Vaccine  doses  with  written  documentation  of  the  date  of
administration  at  age  ≥12  months  are  the  only  doses  considered  to  be  valid.
Self-reported doses and history of vaccination provided by a parent or other caregiver
are  not  considered  adequate  evidence  of  immunity.  Because  of  the  extremely  low
incidence  of  these  diseases  in  the  United  States,  the  validity  of  clinical  diagnosis  of
measles, rubella, and mumps is questionable and should not be considered in assessing
evidence.  Persons  who  do  not  have  documentation  of  adequate  vaccination  or  other
acceptable evidence of immunity (Table 3) should be vaccinated. Serologic screening
for measles, rubella, or mumps immunity before vaccination is not necessary and not
recommended if a person has other acceptable evidence of immunity to these diseases
(Table 3). Similarly, postvaccination serologic testing to verify an immune response is
not recommended. Documented age-appropriate vaccination supersedes the results of
subsequent serologic testing. If a person who has 2 documented doses of measles- or
mumps-containing vaccines is tested serologically and is determined to have negative
or  equivocal  measles  or  mumps  titer  results,  it  is  not  recommended  that  the  person

receive an additional dose of MMR vaccine. Such persons should be considered to have
presumptive  evidence  of  immunity.  In  the  event  that  a  person  who  has  1  dose  of
rubella-containing vaccine is tested serologically and is determined to have negative or
equivocal  rubella  titer  results,  it  is  not  recommended  that  the  person  receive  an
additional  dose  of  MMR  vaccine,  except  for  women  of  childbearing  age.  Women  of
childbearing age who have 1 or 2 documented doses of rubella-containing vaccine and
have rubella-specific IgG levels that are not clearly positive should be administered 1
additional dose of MMR vaccine (maximum of 3 doses) and do not need to be retested
for  serologic  evidence  of  rubella  immunity.  Persons  who  have  documentation  of
adequate vaccination for measles at age ≥12 months, laboratory evidence of measles
immunity,  laboratory  confirmation  of  disease,  or  were  born  before  1957  have
acceptable presumptive evidence of measles immunity (Table 3). Adequate vaccination
for measles for preschool-aged children (i.e., aged ≥12 months) and adults not at high
risk for exposure or transmission is documentation of vaccination with at least 1 dose of
live measles virus-containing vaccine. For school-aged children in kindergarten through
grade 12, students at post-high school educational institutions, health-care personnel,
and  international  travelers,  adequate  vaccination  for  measles  is  documentation  of
vaccination with 2 doses of live measles virus-containing vaccine separated by at least
28 days. Adequate vaccination for measles for infants aged 6 through 11 months before
international  travel  is  1  dose  of  live  measles  virus-containing  vaccine.  Persons  who
have measles-specific IgG antibody that is detectable by any commonly used serologic
assay  are  considered  to  have  adequate  laboratory  evidence  of  measles  immunity.
Persons  with  an  equivocal  serologic  test  result  do  not  have  adequate  presumptive
evidence  of  immunity  and  should  be  considered  susceptible,  unless  they  have  other
evidence  of  measles  immunity  (Table  3)  or  subsequent  testing  indicates  measles
immunity. Persons who have documentation of vaccination with at least 1 dose of live
rubella  virus-containing  vaccine  at  age  ≥12  months,  laboratory  evidence  of  rubella

immunity, laboratory confirmation of disease, or were born before 1957 (except women
who  could  become  pregnant)  have  acceptable  presumptive  evidence  of  rubella
immunity (Table 3). Birth before 1957 is not acceptable evidence of rubella immunity
for women who could become pregnant. Documented evidence of rubella immunity is
important  for  women  who  could  become  pregnant  because  rubella  can  occur  among
some unvaccinated persons born before 1957 and congenital rubella and CRS can occur
among  the  offspring  of  women  infected  with  rubella  during  pregnancy.  Persons  who
have  rubella-specific  antibody  levels  above  the  standard  positive  cutoff  value  for  the
assay  can  be  considered  to  have  adequate  evidence  of  rubella  immunity.  Except  for
women of childbearing age, persons who have an equivocal serologic test result should
be considered susceptible to rubella unless they have documented receipt of 1 dose of
rubella-containing  vaccine  or  subsequent  serologic  test  results  indicate  rubella
immunity.  Vaccinated  women  of  childbearing  age  who  have  received  1  or  2  doses  of
rubella-containing  vaccine  and  have  rubella  serum  IgG  levels  that  are  not  clearly
positive  should  be  administered  1  additional  dose  of  MMR  vaccine  (maximum  of  3
doses)  and  do  not  need  to  be  retested  for  serologic  evidence  of  rubella  immunity.
Persons  who  have  written  documentation  of  adequate  vaccination  for  mumps  at  age
≥12  months,  laboratory  evidence  of  mumps  immunity,  laboratory  confirmation  of
disease,  or  were  born  before  1957  have  acceptable  presumptive  evidence  of  mumps
immunity (Table 3). Adequate vaccination for mumps for preschool-aged children (i.e.,
aged  ≥12  months)  and  adults  not  at  high  risk  for  exposure  or  transmission  is
documentation  of  vaccination  with  at  least  1  dose  of  live  mumps  virus-containing
vaccine.  For  children  in  kindergarten  through  grade  12,  students  at  post-high  school
educational  institutions,  health-care  personnel,  and  international  travelers,  adequate
vaccination  for  mumps  is  documentation  of  2  doses  of  live  mumps  virus-containing
vaccine separated by at least 28 days. Persons who have mumps-specific IgG antibody
that  is  detectable  by  any  commonly  used  serologic  assay  are  considered  to  have

adequate  laboratory  evidence  of  mumps  immunity.  Persons  who  have  an  equivocal
serologic test result should be considered susceptible to mumps unless they have other
evidence  of  mumps  immunity  (Table  3)  or  subsequent  testing  indicates  mumps
immunity. Safe and effective vaccines for prevention of measles, rubella, and mumps
have been available in the United States for more than 40 years. Before availability of
vaccines, measles, rubella, and mumps were common diseases in childhood and caused
significant  morbidity  and  mortality.  As  a  result  of  the  routine  vaccination  program,
measles  and  rubella  elimination  (interruption  of  endemic  transmission  chains  up  to  1
year in length) was achieved in the United States in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and
the  number  of  mumps  cases  has  decreased  by  approximately  99%  (48,82,124).  In
December  2011,  an  expert  panel  reviewed  available  evidence  and  agreed  that  the
United States has maintained elimination of measles and rubella (50,51). Furthermore,
an  economic  analysis  found  that  the  2-dose  MMR  vaccination  program  in  the  United
States resulted in a substantial cost savings (approximately $3.5 billion and $7.6 billion
from  the  direct  cost  and  societal  perspectives,  respectively)  and  high  benefit-cost
ratios: for every dollar spent, the program saves approximately $14 of direct costs and
$10 of additional productivity costs (on the basis of estimates using 2001 U.S. dollars)
(338).  Despite  the  success  in  eliminating  and  maintaining  elimination  of  endemic
transmission  of  measles  and  rubella  in  the  United  States,  the  significant  decline  in
mumps  morbidity  in  the  United  States,  and  the  considerable  progress  achieved  in
global measles and rubella control, measles, rubella, CRS, and mumps are still common
diseases in many countries. Importations will continue to occur and cause outbreaks in
communities  that  have  clusters  of  unvaccinated  persons.  Persons  who  remain
unvaccinated  put  themselves  and  others  in  their  community,  particularly  those  who
cannot be vaccinated, at risk for these diseases and their complications. High levels of
population  immunity  through  vaccination  are  needed  to  prevent  large  outbreaks  and
maintain  measles  and  rubella  elimination  and  low  mumps  incidence  in  the  United

States.  Measles,  rubella,  and  mumps  vaccines  are  recommended  for  prevention  of
measles,  rubella,  and  mumps.  For  prevention  of  measles  and  mumps,  1  dose  is
recommended for preschool-aged children aged ≥12 months and adults not at high risk
for exposure and transmission, and 2 doses are recommended for school-aged children
in kindergarten through grade 12 and adults at high risk for exposure and transmission
(e.g.,  students  attending  colleges  or  other  post-high  school  educational  institutions,
health-care personnel, and international travelers). For prevention of rubella, 1 dose is
recommended for persons aged ≥12 months. Either MMR vaccine or MMRV vaccine can
be  used  to  implement  the  vaccination  recommendations  for  prevention  of  measles,
mumps,  and  rubella  (126).  MMR  vaccine  is  indicated  for  persons  aged  ≥12  months.
MMRV vaccine is licensed for use only in children aged 12 months through 12 years.
The minimum interval between the 2 doses of MMR vaccine or MMR vaccine and MMRV
vaccine is 28 days, with the first dose administered at age ≥12 months. The minimum
interval between 2 doses of MMRV vaccine is 3 months. ACIP recommends that for the
first  dose  of  measles,  mumps,  rubella,  and  varicella  vaccines  at  age  12  through  47
months  either  MMR  vaccine  and  varicella  vaccine  or  MMRV  vaccine  can  be  used.
Providers who are considering administering MMRV vaccine should discuss the benefits
of  and  risks  for  both  vaccination  options  with  the  parents  or  caregivers.  Unless  the
parent or caregiver expresses a preference for MMRV vaccine, CDC recommends that
MMR vaccine and varicella vaccines be administered for the first dose in this age group
because of the increased risk for febrile seizures 5 through 12 days after vaccination
with MMRV vaccine compared with MMR vaccine among children aged 12 through 23
months (126,298,299). For the second dose at any age (15 months through 12 years)
and the first dose at age 48 months through 12 years, use of MMRV vaccine generally is
preferred as opposed to separate injections of its equivalent component vaccines (MMR
vaccine and varicella vaccine). Considerations for using separate injections instead of
MMRV  vaccine  should  include  provider  assessment  (i.e.,  the  number  of  injections,

vaccine  availability,  likelihood  of  improved  coverage,  likelihood  of  patient  return,  and
storage and cost considerations), patient preference, and potential adverse events (see
ACIP recommendations on use of combination MMRV vaccine) (126). All eligible children
should receive the first dose of MMR vaccine routinely at age 12 through 15 months.
Vaccination with MMR vaccine is recommended for all children as soon as possible upon
reaching age 12 months. The second dose of MMR vaccine is recommended routinely
for  all  children  aged  4  through  6  years  before  entering  kindergarten  or  first  grade.
However, the second dose of MMR vaccine can be administered at an earlier age if the
interval between the first and second dose is more than 28 days. Adults born in 1957 or
later should receive at least 1 dose of MMR vaccine unless they have other acceptable
evidence of immunity to these three diseases (Table 3). However, persons who received
measles vaccine of unknown type, inactivated measles vaccine, or further attenuated
measles vaccine accompanied by IG or high-titer measles immune globulin (no longer
available  in  the  United  States)  should  be  considered  unvaccinated  and  should  be
revaccinated with 1 or 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Persons vaccinated before 1979 with
either killed mumps vaccine or mumps vaccine of unknown type who are at high risk for
mumps  infection  (e.g.,  persons  who  are  working  in  a  health-care  facility)  should  be
considered for revaccination with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Adults born before 1957 can
be  considered  to  have  immunity  to  measles,  rubella  (except  for  women  who  could
become  pregnant),  and  mumps.  However,  MMR  vaccine  (1  dose  or  2  doses
administered  at  least  28  days  apart)  can  be  administered  to  any  person  born  before
1957 who does not have a contraindication to MMR vaccination. Adults who might be at
increased risk for exposure or transmission of measles, rubella, or mumps and who do
not  have  evidence  of  immunity  should  receive  special  consideration  for  vaccination.
Students  attending  colleges  or  other  post-high  school  educational  institutions,
health-care  personnel,  and  international  travelers  should  receive  2  doses  of  MMR
vaccine.  All  students  entering  school,  colleges,  universities,  technical  and  vocational

schools, and other institutions for post-high school education should receive 2 doses of
MMR  vaccine  (with  the  first  dose  administered  at  age  ≥12  months)  or  have  other
evidence  of  measles,  rubella,  and  mumps  immunity  (Table  3)  before  enrollment.
Students who have already received 2 appropriately spaced doses of MMR vaccine do
not  need  an  additional  dose  when  they  enter  school.  To  prevent  disease  and
transmission  in  health-care  settings,  health-care  institutions  should  ensure  that  all
persons who work in health-care facilities have documentation of adequate vaccination
against  measles,  rubella,  and  mumps  or  other  acceptable  evidence  of  immunity  to
these diseases (Table 3) (6). Health-Care Personnel Born During or After 1957 Adequate
vaccination for health-care personnel born  during or after 1957 consists of 2 doses of
live measles virus-containing vaccine, 2 doses of live mumps virus-containing vaccine,
and at least 1 dose of a live rubella virus-containing vaccine (Table 3). The second dose
of  live  measles  virus-containing  or  mumps  virus-containing  vaccine  should  be
administered  at  least  28  days  after  their  first  dose.  Health-care  facilities  should  use
secure,  preferably  computerized,  systems  to  manage  vaccination  records  for
health-care  personnel  so  records  can  be  retrieved  easily  (6).  Health-Care  Personnel
Born  Before  1957  Although  birth  before  1957  is  considered  acceptable  evidence  of
measles,  rubella,  and  mumps  immunity,  health-care  facilities  should  consider
vaccinating  unvaccinated  personnel  born  before  1957  who  do  not  have  laboratory
evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity; laboratory confirmation of disease;
or  vaccination  with  2  appropriately  spaced  doses  of  MMR  vaccine  for  measles  and
mumps  and  1  dose  of  MMR  vaccine  for  rubella.  Vaccination  recommendations  during
outbreaks  differ  from  routine  recommendations  for  this  group  (see  section  titled
Recommendations during Outbreaks of Measles, Rubella, or Mumps). Serologic Testing
of Health-Care Personnel Prevaccination antibody screening before measles, rubella, or
mumps vaccination for health-care personnel who do not have adequate presumptive
evidence  of  immunity  is  not  necessary  unless  the  medical  facility  considers  it  cost

effective.  For  health-care  personnel  who  have  2  documented  doses  of  measles-  and
mumps-  containing  vaccine  and  1  documented  dose  of  rubella-containing  vaccine  or
other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity, serologic testing
for  immunity  is  not  recommended.  If  health-care  personnel  who  have  2  documented
doses  of  measles-  or  mumps-  containing  vaccine  are  tested  serologically  and  have
negative or equivocal titer results for measles or mumps, it is not recommended that
they receive an additional dose of MMR vaccine. Such persons should be considered to
have acceptable evidence of measles and mumps immunity; retesting is not necessary.
Similarly, if health-care personnel (except for women of childbearing age) who have one
documented  dose  of  rubella-containing  vaccine  are  tested  serologically  and  have
negative or equivocal titer results for rubella, it is not recommended that they receive
an  additional  dose  of  MMR  vaccine.  Such  persons  should  be  considered  to  have
acceptable  evidence  of  rubella  immunity.  International  Travelers  Aged  ≥6  Months
Measles,  rubella,  and  mumps  are  endemic  in  many  countries  and  protection  against
measles, rubella, and mumps is important before international travel. All persons aged
≥6 months who plan to travel or live abroad should ensure that they have acceptable
evidence of immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps before travel (Table 3). Travelers
aged ≥6 months who do not have acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps
immunity  should  be  vaccinated  with  MMR  vaccine.  Before  departure  from  the  United
States, children aged 6 through 11 months should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine and
children aged ≥12 months and adults should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated
by at least 28 days, with the first dose administered at age ≥12 months. Children who
received  MMR  vaccine  before  age  12  months  should  be  considered  potentially
susceptible  to  all  three  diseases  and  should  be  revaccinated  with  2  doses  of  MMR
vaccine, the first dose administered when the child is aged 12 through 15 months (12
months if the child remains in an area where disease risk is high) and the second dose
at least 28 days later. Women of Childbearing Age All women of childbearing age (i.e.,

adolescent  girls  and  premenopausal  adult  women),  especially  those  who  grew  up
outside the United States in areas where routine rubella vaccination might not occur,
should be vaccinated with 1 dose of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of
rubella  immunity.  Nonpregnant  women  of  childbearing  age  who  do  not  have
documentation  of  rubella  vaccination,  serologic  evidence  of  rubella  immunity,  or
laboratory confirmation of rubella disease should be vaccinated with MMR vaccine. Birth
before  1957  is  not  acceptable  evidence  of  rubella  immunity  for  women  who  could
become  pregnant.  Women  known  to  be  pregnant  should  not  receive  MMR  vaccine.
Upon completion or termination of their pregnancies, women who do not have evidence
of rubella immunity should be vaccinated before discharge from the health-care facility.
Women  should  be  counseled  to  avoid  becoming  pregnant  for  28  days  after
administration of MMR vaccine. Prenatal serologic screening is indicated for all pregnant
women  who  lack  acceptable  evidence  of  rubella  immunity  (Table  3).  Sera  sent  for
screening  for  immunity  should  be  tested  for  rubella  IgG  antibodies  only  and  not  for
rubella IgM antibodies, unless a suspicion exists of recent rubella exposure (i.e., contact
with a person suspected or confirmed to have contracted rubella). Testing for rubella
IgM might lead to detection of nonspecific IgM, resulting in a false positive test result
and long-persisting IgM results that are difficult to interpret (339). Household and Close
Contacts  of  Immunocompromised  Persons  Immunocompromised  persons  are  at  high
risk  for  severe  complications  if  infected  with  measles.  All  family  and  other  close
contacts of immunocompromised persons aged ≥12 months should receive 2 doses of
MMR vaccine unless they have other evidence of measles immunity (Table 3). Persons
with  Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus  (HIV)  Infection  Vaccination  of  Persons  with  HIV
Infection Who Do Not Have Current Evidence of Severe Immunosuppression Two doses
of MMR vaccine are recommended for all persons aged ≥12 months with HIV infection
who  do  not  have  evidence  of  measles,  rubella,  and  mumps  immunity  or  evidence  of
severe immunosuppression. Absence of severe immunosuppression is defined as CD4

percentages  ≥15%  for  ≥6  months  for  persons  aged  ≤5  years  and  CD4  percentages
≥15%  and  CD4  count  ≥200  lymphocytes/mm3  for  ≥6  months  for  persons  aged  >5
years.  When  only  CD4  counts  or  CD4  percentages  are  available  for  those  aged  >5
years,  the  assessment  of  severe  immunosuppression  can  be  on  the  basis  of  the  CD4
values  (count  or  percentage)  that  are  available.  When  CD4  percentages  are  not
available for those aged ≤5 years, the assessment of severe immunosuppression can
be on the basis of age-specific CD4 counts at the time CD4 counts were measured (i.e.,
absence of severe immunosuppression is defined as ≥6 months above age-specific CD4
count  criteria:  CD4  count  >750  lymphocytes/mm3  while  aged  ≤12  months  and  CD4
count  ≥500  lymphocytes/mm3  while  aged  1  through  5  years).  The  first  dose  of  MMR
vaccine should be administered at age 12 through 15 months and the second dose at
age 4 through 6 years, or as early as 28 days after the first dose. Older children and
adults  with  newly  diagnosed  HIV  infections  and  without  acceptable  evidence  of
measles, rubella, or mumps immunity (Table 3) should complete a 2-dose schedule with
MMR vaccine as soon as possible after diagnosis, unless they have evidence of severe
immunosuppression  (i.e.,  CD4  percentage  <15%  [all  ages]  or  CD4  count  <200
lymphocytes/mm3  [aged  >5  years]).  MMRV  vaccine  has  not  been  studied  in  persons
with  HIV  infection  and  should  not  be  substituted  for  MMR  vaccine.  Revaccination  of
Persons  with  Perinatal  HIV  Infection  Who  Do  Not  Have  Evidence  of  Severe
Immunosuppression  Persons  with  perinatal  HIV  infection  who  were  vaccinated  with
measles-, rubella-, or mumps-containing vaccine before establishment of effective ART
should  receive  2  appropriately  spaced  doses  of  MMR  vaccine  (i.e.,  1  dose  now  and
another  dose  at  least  28  days  later)  once  effective  ART  has  been  established  unless
they have other acceptable current evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity
(Table  3).  Established  effective  ART  is  defined  as  receiving  ART  for  ≥6  months  in
combination  with  CD4  percentages  ≥15%  for  ≥6  months  for  persons  aged  ≤5  years
and CD4 percentages ≥15% and CD4 count ≥200 lymphocytes/mm3 for ≥6 months for

persons aged >5 years. When only CD4 counts or only CD4 percentages are available
for  those  aged  >5  years,  the  assessment  of  established  effective  ART  can  be  on  the
basis  of  the  CD4  values  (count  or  percentage)  that  are  available.  When  CD4
percentages are not available for those aged ≤5 years, the assessment of established
effective ART can be on the basis of age-specific CD4 counts at the time CD4 counts
were  measured  (i.e.,  established  effective  ART  is  defined  as  receiving  ART  for  ≥6
months  in  combination  with  meeting  age-specific  CD4  count  criteria  for  ≥6  months:
CD4  count  >750  lymphocytes/mm3  while  aged  ≤12  months  and  CD4  count  ≥500
lymphocytes/mm3 while aged 1 through 5 years). During measles, rubella, or mumps
outbreaks, efforts should be made to ensure that all persons at risk for exposure and
infection  are  vaccinated  or  have  other  acceptable  evidence  of  immunity  (Table  3).
Evidence  of  adequate  vaccination  for  school-aged  children,  college  students,  and
students  in  other  postsecondary  educational  institutions  who  are  at  risk  for  exposure
and infection during measles and mumps outbreaks consists of 2 doses of measles- or
mumps-containing vaccine separated by at least 28 days, respectively. If the outbreak
affects preschool-aged children or adults with community-wide transmission, a second
dose  should  be  considered  for  children  aged  1  through  4  years  or  adults  who  have
received  1  dose.  In  addition,  during  measles  outbreaks  involving  infants  aged  <12
months  with  ongoing  risk  for  exposure,  infants  aged  ≥6  months  can  be  vaccinated.
During  mumps  outbreaks  involving  adults,  MMR  vaccination  should  be  considered  for
persons born before 1957 who do not have other evidence of immunity and might be
exposed. Adequate vaccination during rubella outbreaks for persons aged ≥12 months
consists  of  1  dose  of  rubella-containing  vaccine.  CDC  guidance  for  surveillance  and
outbreak control for measles, rubella, CRS, and mumps can be found in the Manual for
the
 Surveillance
 of
 Vaccine-Preventable
 Diseases
(http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/index.html).  During  an  outbreak  of
measles or mumps, health-care facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine at

the appropriate interval for unvaccinated health-care personnel regardless of birth year
who  lack  laboratory  evidence  of  measles  or  mumps  immunity  or  laboratory
confirmation  of  disease.  Similarly,  during  outbreaks  of  rubella,  health-care  facilities
should  recommend  1  dose  of  MMR  vaccine  for  unvaccinated  personnel  regardless  of
birth year who lack laboratory evidence of rubella immunity or laboratory confirmation
of  infection  or  disease.  Serologic  screening  before  vaccination  is  not  recommended
during  outbreaks  because  rapid  vaccination  is  necessary  to  halt  disease  transmission
(6). If documentation of adequate evidence of immunity has not already been collected,
it  might  be  difficult  to  quickly  obtain  documentation  of  immunity  for  health-care
personnel  during  an  outbreak  or  when  an  exposure  occurs.  Therefore,  health-care
facilities might want to ensure that the measles, rubella, and mumps immunity status
of  health-care  personnel  is  routinely  documented  and  can  be  easily  accessed.  MMR
vaccine,  if  administered  within  72  hours  of  initial  measles  exposure,  might  provide
some  protection  or  modify  the  clinical  course  of  measles  (216–219,222).  For  vaccine
eligible persons aged ≥12 months exposed to measles, administration of MMR vaccine
is preferable to using IG, if administered within 72 hours of initial exposure. If exposure
does  not  cause  infection,  postexposure  vaccination  should  induce  protection  against
subsequent  exposures.  If  exposure  results  in  infection,  no  evidence  indicates  that
administration of MMR vaccine during the presymptomatic or prodromal stage of illness
increases  the  risk  for  vaccine-associated  adverse  events.  Postexposure  MMR
vaccination does not prevent or alter the clinical severity of rubella or mumps and is not
recommended.  If  administered  within  6  days  of  exposure,  IG  can  prevent  or  modify
measles  in  persons  who  are  nonimmune.  IG  is  not  indicated  for  persons  who  have
received  1  dose  of  measles-containing  vaccine  at  age  ≥12  months,  unless  they  are
severely  immunocompromised  (as  defined  later  in  this  report  in  the  subsection  titled
Immunocompromised  patients).  IG  should  not  be  used  to  control  measles  outbreaks,
but rather to reduce the risk for infection and complications in the person receiving it.

IG has not been shown to prevent rubella or mumps infection after exposure and is not
recommended  for  that  purpose.  Any  nonimmune  person  exposed  to  measles  who
received  IG  should  subsequently  receive  MMR  vaccine,  which  should  be  administered
no  earlier  than  6  months  after  IGIM  administration  or  8  months  after  IGIV
administration,  provided  the  person  is  then  aged  ≥12  months  and  the  vaccine  is  not
otherwise contraindicated. The recommended dose of IG administered intramuscularly
(IGIM) is 0.5 mL/kg of body weight (maximum dose = 15 mL) and the recommended
dose of IG given intravenously (IGIV) is 400 mg/kg. The following patient groups are at
risk for severe disease and complications from measles and should receive IG: infants
aged  <12  months,  pregnant  women  without  evidence  of  measles  immunity,  and
severely immunocompromised persons. IGIM can be administered to other persons who
do  not  have  evidence  of  measles  immunity,  but  priority  should  be  given  to  persons
exposed  in  settings  with  intense,  prolonged,  close  contact  (e.g.,  household,  daycare,
and  classroom).  For  exposed  persons  without  evidence  of  measles  immunity,  a  rapid
IgG antibody test can be used to inform immune status, provided that administration of
IG  is  not  delayed.  Infants  aged  <12  months.  Because  infants  are  at  higher  risk  for
severe  measles  and  complications,  and  infants  are  susceptible  to  measles  if  mothers
are nonimmune or their maternal antibodies to measles have waned (337), IGIM should
be administered to all infants aged <12 months who have been exposed to measles.
For infants aged 6 through 11 months, MMR vaccine can be administered in place of IG
if  administered  within  72  hours  of  exposure.  Pregnant  women  without  evidence  of
measles  immunity.  Because  pregnant  women  might  be  at  higher  risk  for  severe
measles  and  complications  (20),  IGIV  should  be  administered  to  pregnant  women
without  evidence  of  measles  immunity  who  have  been  exposed  to  measles.  IGIV  is
recommended to administer doses high enough to achieve estimated protective levels
of
 measles
 antibody
 titers.
 Immunocompromised
 patients.
 Severely
immunocompromised  patients  who  are  exposed  to  measles  should  receive  IGIV

prophylaxis regardless of immunologic or vaccination status because they might not be
protected by the vaccine. Severely immunocompromised patients include patients with
severe  primary  immunodeficiency;  patients  who  have  received  a  bone  marrow
transplant until at least 12 months after finishing all immunosuppressive treatment, or
longer in patients who have developed graft-versus-host disease; patients on treatment
for  ALL  within  and  until  at  least  6  months  after  completion  of  immunosuppressive
chemotherapy;  and  patients  with  a  diagnosis  of  AIDS  or  HIV-infected  persons  with
severe immunosuppression defined as CD4 percent <15% (all ages) or CD4 count <200
lymphocytes/mm3  (aged  >5  years)  and  those  who  have  not  received  MMR  vaccine
since  receiving  effective  ART.  Some  experts  include  HIV-infected  persons  who  lack
recent  confirmation  of  immunologic  status  or  measles  immunity.  For  persons  already
receiving IGIV therapy, administration of at least 400 mg/kg body weight within 3 weeks
before measles exposure should be sufficient to prevent measles infection. For patients
receiving subcutaneous immune globulin (IGSC) therapy, administration of at least 200
mg/kg  body  weight  for  2  consecutive  weeks  before  measles  exposure  should  be
sufficient. To maintain measles, rubella, and CRS elimination, and control of mumps in
the  United  States,  rapid  detection  of  cases  is  necessary  so  that  appropriate  control
measures can be quickly implemented. This is to prevent imported strains of virus from
establishing endemic chains of transmission.  Pockets of unvaccinated populations can
pose  a  risk  to  maintaining  elimination  of  measles,  rubella,  and  CRS  and  control  of
mumps, because these diseases will continue to be imported into the United States as
long  as  they  remain  endemic  globally.   The  key  challenges  to  maintaining  measles,
rubella, and CRS elimination and control of mumps in the United States are 1) ensuring
high routine vaccination coverage which means vaccinating children at age 12 through
15  months  with  a  first  dose  of  MMR  vaccine  and  ensuring  that  school-aged  children
receive a second dose of MMR vaccine (for measles and mumps), 2) vaccinating high
risk  groups  such  as  health-care  personnel,  international  travelers,  including  infants

aged 6 through 11 months, and students at post-high school educational institutions, 3)
maintaining awareness of these diseases among health-care personnel and the public,
4) working with U.S. government agencies and international agencies, including WHO,
on  global  measles  and  rubella  mortality  reduction  and  elimination  goals,  and  5)
ensuring that public health departments continue conducting surveillance and initiating
prompt public health responses when a suspect case is reported.    This report is based,

Alternate Text: This figure provides the number of measles cases in the United States
from  1962  through  2011.  After  the  introduction  of  the  1-dose  measles  vaccination
program, the number of reported measles cases decreased during the late 1960s and
early  1970s  to  approximately  22,000-75,000  cases  per  year.  FIGURE  2.  Number  of

an overview of the number of rubella cases shown with the jagged line and number of

CRS cases shown with the solid line since 1966. After licensure and recommendation for
use  in  1969,  the  number  of  rubella  and  CRS  cases  declined  dramatically.  However,
incidence  increased  in  the  late  1970s  and  early  1990s,  as  a  result  of  outbreaks  in
unvaccinated  populations.  FIGURE  3.  Number  of  mumps  cases  —  United  States,

United States from 1968 through 2011. Reported cases of mumps decreased steadily
after the introduction of live mumps vaccine in 1967 and the recommendation in 1977
for  routine  vaccination.  TABLE  1.  Summary  of  immune  response  (seroconversion),

months;  the  second  dose  of  measles-  or  mumps-containing  vaccine  should  be
administered  no  earlier  than  28  days  after  the  first  dose.   ¶Measles,  rubella,  or

mumps  immunoglobulin  G  (IgG)  in  serum;  equivocal  results  should  be  considered
negative. **Children who receive a dose of MMR vaccine at age <12 months should
be revaccinated with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, the first of which should be administered
when the child is aged 12 through 15 months and the second at least 28 days later. If
the  child  remains  in  an  area  where  disease  risk  is  high,  the  first  dose  should  be
administered at age 12 months. ††For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who
lack  laboratory  evidence  of  measles,  rubella,  or  mumps  immunity  or  laboratory
confirmation  of  disease,  health-care  facilities  should  consider  vaccinating  personnel
with 2 doses of MMR vaccine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and 1
dose  of  MMR  vaccine  (for  rubella),  respectively.   §§Women  of  childbearing  age  are
adolescent girls and premenopausal adult women. Because rubella can occur in some
persons  born  before  1957  and  because  congenital  rubella  and  congenital  rubella
syndrome  can  occur  in  the  offspring  of  women  infected  with  rubella  virus  during
pregnancy, birth before 1957 is not acceptable evidence of rubella immunity for women
who  could  become  pregnant.   ¶¶Adults  at  high  risk  include  students  in  post-high
school  educational  institutions,  health-care  personnel,  and  international  travelers.
