at end of text) Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in
the United States (1). One of the Healthy People 2020 objectives calls for reducing the
proportion of U.S. adults who smoke cigarettes to ≤12% (objective TU-1.1) (2). Despite
progress in reducing smoking prevalence over the past several decades, nearly one in
five  U.S.  adults,  including  millions  of  workers,  still  smoke  cigarettes  (1,3).  During
2004–2010,  nearly  one  fifth  (19.6%)  of  U.S.  working  adults  aged  ≥18  years  smoked
cigarettes,  and  of  all  the  industry  sectors,  current  smoking  prevalence  among  the
accommodation  and  food  services  sector  workers  (30%)  was  the  highest  (3).  CDC
analyzed  National  Health  Interview  Survey  (NHIS)  data  for  2011–2013  to  estimate
current cigarette smoking prevalence among adults working in the accommodation and
food  services  sector,  and  found  that  these  workers  had  higher  cigarette  smoking
prevalence (25.9%) than all other workers (17.3%). Among workers in accommodation
and  food  services  sector,  the  highest  smoking  prevalences  were  observed  among
males, non-Hispanic whites, those aged 25–44 years, those with a high school diploma
or  a  General  Educational  Development  (GED)  certificate  and  no  college  education,
those  with  an  annual  family  income  <$35,000,  those  with  no  health  insurance,  and
those working in the food services and drinking places industry. These results indicate a
need to better understand the reasons for higher smoking prevalence observed among
accommodation and food services workers (e.g., workplace culture), so that appropriate
intervention  strategies  can  be  developed  and  implemented.  Evidence  suggests  that
smoke-free  worksites  and  workplace  cessation  programs,  including  comprehensive
worksite smoke-free policies, health promotion, access to smoking cessation programs,
and increasing the cost of tobacco products, can substantially reduce smoking among
workers  (1,4,5).  NHIS  data  are  collected  annually  from  a  nationally  representative
sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population through a personal household
interview.  During  2011–2013,  survey  response  rates  ranged  from  66.3%  (2011)  to

61.2%  (2013)  (6).  To  improve  the  precision  and  reliability  of  the  estimates,  CDC
combined 2011-2013 NHIS data. Data were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to
be  nationally  representative;  95%  confidence  intervals  were  calculated.  Two-tailed
t-tests  were  used  to  determine  statistically  significant  differences  between  point
estimates.*  Cigarette  smokers  were  defined  as  adults  aged  ≥18  years  who  reported
having  smoked  ≥100  cigarettes  during  their  lifetime  and,  at  the  time  of  interview,
reported smoking every day or some days. Survey participants were considered to be
working currently if, when asked about their employment status during the week before
their interview, they responded "working at a job or business," "with a job or business
but  not  at  work,"  or  "working,  but  not  for  pay,  at  a  family-owned  job  or  business."
Information on participants' industry of employment and occupation was classified by
trained coders (6). Workers within the accommodation and food services sector were
identified,  and  two  industries  and  10  occupations  were  examined  within  the  sector.†
Cigarette  smoking  prevalences  were  calculated  for  the  accommodation  and  food
services  sector  workers  and  for  all  other  workers  (i.e.,  those  not  working  in  the
accommodation  and  food  services)  by  selected  characteristics.  During  2011-2013,
approximately 142 million (60.5%) of the estimated 235 million U.S. adults aged ≥18
years were employed during the week before the interview; among these, an estimated
9.3  million  (6.6%)  worked  in  the  accommodation  and  food  services  sector.  Overall
cigarette smoking prevalence was 17.8% among U.S. working adults, with a prevalence
of  25.9%  among  the  accommodation  and  food  services  sector  workers  and  17.3%
among  all  other  U.S.  workers.  Among  the  accommodation  and  food  services  sector
workers, cigarette smoking was highest among those aged 25−44 years (31.4%), those
with a high school diploma/GED certificate and no college education (32.1%), those with
an  annual  family  income  <$35,000  (30.9%),  and  those  with  no  health  insurance
(29.3%)  (Table  1).  Compared  with  all  other  working  adults  who  currently  smoked,
accommodation  and  food  services  workers  who  smoked  were  less  educated  (41.2%

versus 36.0% with only a high school diploma/GED certificate), more likely to live below
the  federal  poverty  level  (22.3%  versus  11.6%),  to  have  ≤5  years  on  the  job  (75.5%
versus  58.3%),  and  to  smoke  ≥12  cigarettes  per  day  (70%  versus  61.6%)  (Table  2).
Cigarette smoking prevalence among workers in the food services and drinking places
(26.8%) industry and in five of the 10 occupations within the accommodation and food
services sector was greater than twice the Healthy People 2020 target of ≤12% for U.S.
adults.  Cigarette  smoking  prevalence  exceeded  25%  among  workers  in  the  motor
vehicle operators and material moving and other transportation (37.2%), management
(32.6%),  supervisors  of  food  preparers  (27.3%),  food  and  beverage  servers  (27.0%),
and  cooks  and  food  preparers  (26.5%)  occupations  (Table  3).  The  U.S.  Surgeon
General's  report  on  the  health  consequences  of  smoking  concluded  that  disease  and
death  from  tobacco  use  are  overwhelmingly  caused  by  cigarettes  and  other
combustible tobacco products, and that rapid elimination of their use will substantially
reduce this burden (1). Furthermore, smoking costs an estimated annual >$130 billion
in  direct  medical  expenses,  $151  billion  in  lost  productivity,  and  $5.6  billion  for  lost
productivity  attributable  to  premature  deaths  caused  by  exposure  to  secondhand
smoke  (1).  This  report  indicates  that  2.4  million  workers  in  the  accommodation  and
food  services  sector  currently  smoke  cigarettes,  and  among  those,  prevalence  was
highest among males, non-Hispanic whites, persons with less education, those who live
below the poverty level, those who have been working for <5 years, and those who had
no  health  insurance.  Furthermore,  no  significant  changes  in  cigarette  smoking
prevalence  were  observed  among  accommodation  and  food  services  sector  workers
since 2004–2010 (3), and smoking prevalence in this sector remains significantly higher
than workers in all other sectors. Several intervention and prevention measures have
been  shown  to  be  effective  in  reducing  smoking  prevalence  and  secondhand  smoke
exposure (1,4), including smoke-free workplace policies. Although workplace policies or
exposures  to  secondhand  smoke  in  the  workplace  were  not  assessed  in  this  study,

historical  data  have  shown  that  only  43%  of  workers  in  food  preparation  and  service
occupations are covered under smoke-free worksite policies (7). Although such policies
have  been  shown  to  be  beneficial  in  reducing  smoking  rates,  increasing  quit  rates
among  those  who  smoke,  reducing  secondhand  smoke  exposure  among  nonsmokers
and  thus  improving  overall  health  of  workers,  they  have  not  yet  been  universally
adopted  or  implemented.§  Other  proven  population-based  interventions  include
increasing  tobacco  prices,  implementing  comprehensive  smoke-free  policies  in
workplaces  and  public  places,  employing  anti-tobacco  mass  media  campaigns,  and
ensuring  barrier-free  access  to  quitting  assistance  (8).  Furthermore,  in  concert  with
Total  Worker  Health,¶  a  strategy  that  integrates  occupational  safety  and  health
protection with health promotion to prevent worker injury and illness, employers may
adopt  workplace  interventions  that  address  health  risks  from  both  the  work
environment  and  from  individual  behavior,  with  the  goal  of  reducing  smoking-related
disparities. Employers, businesses, trade associations, and worker representatives can
work in partnership with their state and local health departments to implement these
evidence-based policies and programs to reduce the prevalence of smoking among U.S.
workers.  The  findings  in  this  report  are  subject  to  at  least  two  limitations.  First,  the
employment  information  collected  applied  only  to  the  week  preceding  the  interview.
Some  workers  might  have  changed  jobs  and  thus  might  have  been  in  a  different
occupation  or  industry  before  the  time  of  the  survey.  However,  additional  analyses
examining longest held job showed similar results. Second, the extent of underreporting
or  over  reporting  of  cigarette  smoking  could  not  be  determined  because  smoking
information was self-reported and was not validated by biochemical tests; nevertheless,
comparison  of  self-reported  smoking  status  with  results  of  measured  serum  cotinine
levels suggests generally high levels of validity (9). Workers in the accommodation and
food  services  sector  have  a  higher  prevalence  of  cigarette  smoking  than  all  other
civilian U.S. working adults. A Healthy People 2020 objective (TU-13) calls for all states

to  enact  laws  on  smoke-free  indoor  air  that  prohibits  smoking  in  public  places  and
worksites (2). Although considerable progress has been made during the past decade,
with increasing numbers of states having comprehensive smoke-free laws that prohibit
smoking in all indoor areas of worksites, restaurants, and bars, an estimated 2.4 million
workers  in  the  food  and  accommodation  services  sector  still  smoke  cigarettes  (10).
Continued  adoption  of  proven  population-based  interventions,  in  concert  with
intensified  implementation  of  comprehensive  smoke-free  laws  in  indoor  public  places
and worksites, can reduce cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke and
thus  can  improve  individual  health  (1).  Linda  J.  Neff,  Office  on  Smoking  and  Health,

progress  in  reducing  smoking  prevalence  over  the  past  several  decades,  millions  of
working adults still smoke cigarettes, the most commonly used tobacco product in the
United States. During 2004-2010, 19.6% of U.S. working adults were cigarette smokers.

Among them, workers in the accommodation and food services sector had one of the
highest smoking prevalences (30.0%). What is added by this report? During 2011–2013,
accommodation and food services workers had nearly 50% higher smoking prevalences
than all other U.S. workers, and no significant changes in cigarette smoking prevalence
were observed among these workers since 2004–2010. Workers in the accommodation
and food service industries and in most occupations within the sector had high smoking
prevalences, which were greater than the target of Healthy People 2020 target of ≤12%
for  U.S.  adults.  What  are  the  implications  for  public  health  practice?  Continued
implementation  of  effective  public  health  interventions  and  adoption  of  integrated
approaches  to  address  health  risks  from  both  the  work  environment  and  individual
behavior  can  reduce  smoking-related  disparities.  Employers,  businesses,  trade
associations, and worker representatives can work in partnership with their state and
local  health  departments  in  implementing  evidence-based  policies  and  programs  to
reduce the prevalence of smoking among the working population. TABLE 1. Cigarette
