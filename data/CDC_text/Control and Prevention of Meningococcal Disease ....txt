and  the  title  of  the  report  in  the  subject  line  of  e-mail.  Summary   These
recommendations update information regarding the
polysaccharide vaccine licensed in the United States for use
against disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroups A, C,
Y, and W-135, as well as antimicrobial agents for chemoprophylaxis
against meningococcal disease (superseding MMWR 1985;34:255-9).
This report provides additional information regarding
meningococcal vaccines and the addition of ciprofloxacin and
ceftriaxone as acceptable alternatives to rifampin for
chemoprophylaxis  in  selected  populations.   INTRODUCTION   Neisseria  meningitidis
causes both endemic and epidemic
disease, principally meningitis and meningococcemia (1). As a
result of the control of Haemophilus influenzae type b infections,
N. meningitidis has become the leading cause of bacterial
meningitis in children and young adults in the United States, with
an estimated 2,600 cases each year (2). The case-fatality rate is
13% for meningitic disease (defined as the isolation of N.
meningitidis from cerebrospinal fluid) and 11.5% for persons who
have N. meningitidis isolated from blood (2), despite therapy with
antimicrobial agents (e.g., penicillin) to which U.S. strains
remain  clinically  sensitive  (3).   The  incidence  of  meningococcal  disease  peaks  in  late
winter
to early spring. Attack rates are highest among children 3-12
months of age and then steadily decline among older age groups
(Figure_1). Based on multistate surveillance conducted during

1989-1991, serogroup B organisms accounted for 46% of all cases
and serogroup C for 45%; serogroups W-135 and Y and strains that
could not be serotyped accounted for most of the remaining cases
(2). Recent data indicate that the proportion of cases caused by
serogroup Y strains is increasing (4). Serogroup A, which rarely
causes disease in the United States, is the most common cause of
epidemics in Africa and Asia. In the United States, localized
community outbreaks of serogroup C disease and a statewide
serogroup  B  epidemic  have  recently  been  reported  (5,6).   Persons  who  have  certain
medical conditions are at increased
risk for developing meningococcal infection. Meningococcal disease
is particularly common among persons who have component
deficiencies in the terminal common complement pathway (C3, C5-C9);
many of these persons experience multiple episodes of
infection (6). Asplenic persons also may be at increased risk for
acquiring meningococcal disease with particularly severe
infections (8). Persons who have other diseases associated with
immunosuppression (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus {HIV} and
Streptococcus pneumoniae) may be at higher risk for acquiring
meningococcal disease and for disease caused by some other
encapsulated bacteria. Evidence suggests that HIV-infected persons
are not at substantially increased risk for epidemic serogroup A
meningococcal disease (9); however, such patients may be at
increased risk for sporadic meningococcal disease or disease
caused by other meningococcal serogroups (10). Previously,
military recruits had high rates of meningococcal disease,

particularly serogroup C disease; however, since the initiation of
routine vaccination of recruits with the bivalent A/C
meningococcal vaccine in 1971, the high rates of meningococcal
disease caused by those serogroups have decreased substantially
and cases occur infrequently (11). Military recruits now routinely
receive  the  quadrivalent  A,C,Y,  W-135  meningococcal  vaccine.   MENINGOCOCCAL
POLYSACCHARIDE  VACCINE   The  quadrivalent  A,C,Y,W-135  vaccine  (Menomune
-A,C,Y,W-135,
manufactured by Connaught Laboratories, Inc.) is the formulation
currently available in the United States. The recommended dose of
vaccine is a single 0.5-mL subcutaneous injection. Each vaccine
dose consists of 50 ug each of the purified bacterial capsular
polysaccharides. Menomune is available in single-dose, 10-dose,
and  50-dose  vials.   Vaccine  Efficacy   The  immunogenicity  and  clinical  efficacy  of  the
serogroups A
and C meningococcal vaccines have been well established. The
serogroup A polysaccharide induces antibody in some children as
young as 3 months of age, although a response comparable with that
among adults is not achieved until 4 or 5 years of age; the
serogroup C component is poorly immunogenic in recipients who are
less than 18-24 months of age (12,13). The serogroups A and C
vaccines have demonstrated estimated clinical efficacies of
 85%-100%
in older children and adults and are useful in controlling
epidemics (9,14-17). Serogroups Y and W-135 polysaccharides are
safe and immunogenic in adults and in children greater than 2
years of age (18-21); although clinical protection has not been

documented, vaccination with these polysaccharides induces
bactericidal antibody. The antibody responses to each of the four
polysaccharides in the quadrivalent vaccine are serogroup-specific
and  independent.   Duration  of  Efficacy   Measurable  levels  of  antibodies  against  the
group A and C
polysaccharides decrease markedly during the first 3 years
following a single dose of vaccine (13,22-25). This decrease in
antibody occurs more rapidly in infants and young children than in
adults. Similarly, although vaccine-induced clinical protection
probably persists in schoolchildren and adults for at least 3
years, the efficacy of the group A vaccine in young children may
decrease markedly with the passage of time: in a 3-year study,
efficacy declined from greater than 90% to less than 10% among
children who were less than 4 years of age at the time of
vaccination, whereas among children who were greater than or equal
to 4 years of age when vaccinated, efficacy was 67% 3 years later
(26).   RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR  USE  OF  MENINGOCOCCAL  VACCINE   Routine
vaccination of civilians with the quadrivalent
meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is not recommended because of
its relative ineffectiveness in children less than 2 years of age
(among whom risk for endemic disease is highest) and its
relatively short duration of protection. However, the
polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine is useful for controlling
serogroup  C  meningococcal  outbreaks  (27).   Indications  for  Use   In  general,  use  of
polysaccharide meningococcal vaccine
should be restricted to persons greater than or equal to 2 years
of age; however, children as young as 3 months of age may be

vaccinated to elicit short-term protection against serogroup A
meningococcal disease (two doses administered 3 months apart
should be considered for children 3-18 months of age) (28).  Routine vaccination with
the quadrivalent vaccine is
recommended for certain high-risk groups, including persons who
have terminal complement component deficiencies and those who have
anatomic or functional asplenia. Persons whose spleens have been
removed because of trauma or nonlymphoid tumors and persons who
have inherited complement deficiencies have acceptable antibody
responses to meningococcal vaccine; however, the clinical efficacy
of vaccination has not been documented for these persons, and they
may not be protected by vaccination (7,29). Research, industrial,
and clinical laboratory personnel who routinely are exposed to N.
meningitidis in solutions that may be aerosolized should be
considered for vaccination.  Vaccination with the quadrivalent vaccine may benefit
travelers to and U.S. citizens residing in countries in which N.
meningitidis is hyperendemic or epidemic, particularly if contact
with the local populace will be prolonged. Single-dose vials of
the quadrivalent vaccine are now available and may be more
convenient than multidose vials for use in international health
clinics for travelers (30). Epidemics of meningococcal disease are
recurrent in that part of sub-Saharan Africa known as the
"meningitis belt," which extends from Senegal in the west to
Ethiopia in the east (Figure_2) (31). Epidemics in the
 meningitis
belt usually occur during the dry season (i.e., from December to
June); thus, vaccination is recommended for travelers visiting

this region during that time. Epidemics occasionally are
identified in other parts of the world and recently have occurred
in Saudi Arabia (during a Haj pilgrimage), Kenya, Tanzania,
Burundi, and Mongolia. Information concerning geographic areas for
which vaccination is recommended can be obtained from
international health clinics for travelers, state health
departments,  and  CDC  (telephone:  {404}  332-4559).   Primary  Vaccination   For  both
adults and children, vaccine is administered
subcutaneously as a single 0.5-mL dose. The vaccine can be
administered at the same time as other vaccines but at a different
anatomic site (i.e., deltoid muscle or buttocks). Protective
levels of antibody are usually achieved within 7-10 days after
vaccination.  Revaccination  Revaccination may be indicated for persons at high risk for
infection (e.g., persons remaining in areas in which disease is
epidemic), particularly for children who were first vaccinated
when they were less than 4 years of age; such children should be
considered for revaccination after 2-3 years if they remain at
high risk. Although the need for revaccination of older children
and adults has not been determined, antibody levels decline
rapidly over 2-3 years, and if indications still exist for
immunization, revaccination may be considered within 3-5 years.  PRECAUTIONS AND
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Reactions to Vaccination  Adverse reactions to meningococcal vaccine are mild and
consist principally of pain and redness at the injection site, for
1-2 days. Estimates of incidence of mild-to-moderate local
reactions have varied, ranging from infrequent to greater than 40%
among vaccine recipients (32,33). Pain at the site of injection is

the most commonly reported adverse reaction, and a transient fever
might  develop  in  less  than  or  equal  to  2%  of  young  children.   Vaccination  During
Pregnancy  Studies of vaccination during pregnancy have not documented
adverse effects among either pregnant women or newborns (34,35).
In addition, these studies have documented high antibody levels in
maternal and umbilical cord blood following vaccination during
pregnancy. Antibody levels in the infants decreased during the
first few months after birth; subsequent response to meningococcal
vaccination was not affected (35). These observations have been
confirmed in more recent studies of other polysaccharide vaccines
administered during pregnancy (36). Based on data from studies
involving use of meningococcal vaccines and other polysaccharide
vaccines administered during pregnancy, altering meningococcal
vaccination recommendations during pregnancy is unnecessary.  PROSPECTS FOR NEW
MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINES  To enhance the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of
A
and C polysaccharides in infants and young children, methods
similar to those used for H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines
have been applied to produce conjugate serogroups A and C vaccines
(37,38). Capsular polysaccharides are being covalently linked to
carrier proteins to convert the T-cell-independent polysaccharide
to a T-cell-dependent antigen. The efficacy of these vaccines has
not been evaluated.  Because the serogroup B capsular polysaccharide is poorly
immunogenic in humans, vaccine development for serogroup B
meningococci has focused on the outer membrane proteins as
potential immunogens. The immunogenicity and protective efficacy
of several outer membrane protein vaccines against several

serogroup B meningococci have been evaluated recently. Evaluation
of those vaccines documented estimated efficacies ranging from 57%
to 83% in older children and adults (39-41). However, a subsequent
study of one of these vaccines did not document efficacy in
children less than 4 years of age, the group often at highest risk
for disease (42). None of the currently available serogroup B
meningococcal  vaccines  are  licensed  for  use  in  the  United  States.   ANTIMICROBIAL
CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS  Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of sporadic
cases of meningococcal disease is the primary means for prevention
of meningococcal disease in the United States (Table_1). Close
contacts include a) household members, b) day care center
contacts, and c) anyone directly exposed to the patient's oral
secretions (e.g., through kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation,
endotracheal intubation, or endotracheal tube management). The
attack rate for household contacts exposed to patients who have
sporadic meningococcal disease has been estimated to be four cases
per 1,000 persons exposed, which is 500-800 times greater than for
the total population (43). Because the rate of secondary disease
for close contacts is highest during the first few days after
onset of disease in the primary patient, antimicrobial
chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible
(ideally within 24 hours after the case is identified).
Conversely, chemoprophylaxis administered greater than 14 days
after onset of illness in the index case-patient is probably of
limited or no value. Oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal cultures are
not helpful in determining the need for chemoprophylaxis and may
unnecessarily  delay  institution  of  this  preventive  measure.   Rifampin  is  administered

twice daily for 2 days (600 mg every
12 hours for adults, 10 mg/kg of body weight every 12 hours for
children greater than or equal to 1 month of age, and 5 mg/kg
every 12 hours for infants less than 1 month of age). Rifampin is
effective in eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage of N.
meningitidis (44). Rifampin is not recommended for pregnant women,
because the drug is teratogenic in laboratory animals. Rifampin
changes the color of urine to reddish-orange and is excreted in
tears and other body fluids; it may cause permanent discoloration
of soft contact lenses. Because the reliability of oral
contraceptives may be affected by rifampin therapy, consideration
should be given to using alternate contraceptive measures while
rifampin is being administered.  In addition to rifampin, other antimicrobial agents are
effective in reducing nasopharyngeal carriage of N. meningitidis.
Ciprofloxacin in various dosage regimens is greater than 90%
effective in eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage (45,46). A single
500-mg oral dose of ciprofloxacin is a reasonable alternative to
the multidose rifampin regimen. Ciprofloxacin levels in nasal
secretions far exceed the MIC90 for N. meningitidis following oral
dosing (47). Ciprofloxacin is not generally recommended for
persons less than 18 years of age or for pregnant and lactating
women because the drug causes cartilage damage in immature
laboratory animals. However, a recent international consensus
report has concluded that ciprofloxacin can be used for
chemoprophylaxis of children when no acceptable alternative
therapy  is  available  (48).   When  ceftriaxone  was  administered  in  a  single  parenteral
dose

(an intramuscular dose of 125 mg for children and 250 mg for
adults), it was 97%-100% effective in eradicating pharyngeal
carriage of N. meningitidis (49,50). Thus, ceftriaxone (diluted in
1% lidocaine to reduce local pain after injection) is also a
reasonable  alternative  for  chemoprophylaxis.   Systemic  antimicrobial  therapy  of
meningococcal disease with
agents other than ceftriaxone or other third-generation
cephalosporins may not reliably eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage
of N. meningitidis. If other agents have been used for treatment,
the index patient should receive chemoprophylactic antibiotics for
eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage before being discharged
from the hospital (51).  CONCLUSIONS  N. meningitidis is the leading cause of bacterial
meningitis
in older children and young adults in the United States. The
quadrivalent A, C, Y, and W-135 meningococcal vaccine available in
the United States is recommended for control of serogroup C
meningococcal disease outbreaks and for use among certain
high-risk groups, including a) persons who have terminal
complement deficiencies, b) persons who have anatomic or
functional asplenia, and c) laboratory personnel who routinely are
exposed to N. meningitidis in solutions that may be aerosolized.
Vaccination also may benefit travelers to countries in which
disease is hyperendemic or epidemic. Conjugate serogroup A and C
meningococcal vaccines are being developed by using methods
similar to those used for H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccines,
and the efficacies of several experimental serogroup B
meningococcal vaccines have been documented in older children and

young adults.  Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of patients
who have sporadic cases of meningococcal disease is the primary
means for prevention of meningococcal disease in the United
States. Rifampin has been the drug of choice for chemoprophylaxis;
however, data from recent studies document that single doses of
ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone are reasonable alternatives to the
multidose rifampin regimen for chemoprophylaxis.  References
